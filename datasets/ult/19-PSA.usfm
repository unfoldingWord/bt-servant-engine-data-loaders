\c 1
\q1
\v 1 Happy is the man who walks not in the advice of the wicked {ones}, \q2 and stands not in the pathway of sinners, \q2 and sits not in the seat of scoffers, \q1
\v 2 but in the instruction of Yahweh {is} his delight, \q2 and in his instruction he meditates day and night.
\q1 \v 3 And he is like a tree set to grow on streams of water, \q2 which gives its fruit in its season, \q2 and its leaf does not wither, \q1 and he makes successful all that he does.
\b
\ts\*
\q1 \v 4 Not so the wicked {ones}! \q2 But {they are} like the chaff that wind chases away. \q1
\v 5 Thus the wicked {ones} will not stand in the judgment, \q2 nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous {ones}.
\b
\ts\*
\q1 \v 6 For Yahweh knows the way of the righteous {ones}, \q2 but the way of the wicked {ones} will perish.
\ts\*

\c 2
\q
\v 1 Why do nations conspire
\q2 and peoples plot futilely?
\q1 \v 2 The kings of the earth take their stand,
\q2 and the rulers conspire together
\q2 against Yahweh and against his anointed,
\q1 \v 3 “Let us tear apart their bonds
\q2 and cast their cords away from us.”
\b
\ts\*
\q1 \v 4 He who is sitting in the heavens laughs;
\q2 the Lord mocks them.
\q1 \v 5 Then he will speak to them in his anger
\q2 and terrify them in his fury,
\q1 \v 6 “I myself have poured out my king
\q2 on Zion, the mountain of my holiness.”
\b
\ts\*
\q1 \v 7 I will describe a decree of Yahweh.
\q2 He said to me, “You are my son!
\q3 Today I have begotten you.
\q3 \v 8 Ask from me, and I will give nations {as} your inheritance
\q4 and the extremities of the earth {as} your possession.
\q3 \v 9 You will break them with an iron rod;
\q4 like a jar of a potter, you will smash them to pieces.”
\b
\ts\*
\q1 \v 10 And now kings, act prudently;
\q2 be admonished, rulers of the earth.
\q1 \v 11 Serve Yahweh with fear
\q2 and rejoice with trembling.
\q1 \v 12 Kiss the son, lest he be angry
\q2 and you perish in the way,
\q2 for his anger burns for just a moment.
\q1 Happy are all seekers of refuge in him.

\c 3
\d A psalm of David, when he fled from the face of Absalom his son.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 1 Yahweh, how many my oppressors have become!
\q2 The risers against me are many.
\q1 \v 2 {There are} many sayers about me,
\q2 “There is no salvation for him in God.”
\qsSelah
\qs*

\b
\ts\*
\q1 \v 3 But you, Yahweh, are a shield behind me,
\q2 my glory, and the lifter up of my head.
\q1 \v 4 {With} my voice I call to Yahweh,
\q2 and he answered me from the hill of his holiness.
\qsSelah
\qs*

\ts\*
\q1 \v 5 I laid myself down and slept. I awoke,
\q2 for Yahweh protects me.
\q1 \v 6 I will not fear the multitudes of people
\q2 who stand against me round about.
\b
\ts\*
\q1 \v 7 Rise up, Yahweh! Save me, my God!
\q2 For you hit all my enemies on the cheek;
\q2 the teeth of the wicked you break.
\q1 \v 8 Salvation {is} of Yahweh.
\q2 Your blessing {is} on your people.

\c 4
\d For the director, with stringed instruments. Of David.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 1 Answer me when I call, God of my righteousness,
\q2 in distress you relieve me.
\q2 Be gracious {to} me and hear my prayer.
\b
\ts\*
\q1 \v 2 Son of man, until when {will} my glory become shame?
\q2 {Until when} will you love futility, {until when} will you seek falsehood?
\qs \qs*  Selah
\q1 \v 3 But know that Yahweh has set apart the covenantally faithful for himself.
\q2 Yahweh hears when I call to him.
\q1 \v 4 Tremble and do not sin!
\q Meditate in your heart on your bed and be silent.
\qs \qs*  Selah
\q1 \v 5 Sacrifice sacrifices of righteousness
\q2 and trust in Yahweh.
\b
\ts\*
\q1 \v 6 Many say, “Who will show us good?”
\q2 Lift up the light of your face on us Yahweh!
\q1 \v 7 You have put joy in my heart
\q2 more than the time {when} their grain and their new wine abound.
\q1 \v 8 In peace I will both lie down and sleep,
\q2 for you alone, Yahweh, cause me to dwell securely.

\c 5
\d For the director. On the flutes. A psalm of David.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 1 {To} my words give ear, Yahweh!
\q2 Understand my murmuring!
\q1 \v 2 Listen attentively to the sound of my cry for help,
\q2 my king and my God,
\q2 for to you I pray!
\b
\ts\*
\q1 \v 3 Yahweh, in the morning you hear my voice.
\q2 In the morning I prepare for you and watch.
\q1 \v 4 For you are not a god pleased with wickedness;
\q2 evil ones will not sojourn with you.
\q1 \v 5 The arrogant will not stand in front of your eyes;
\q2 you hate all doers of iniquity.
\q1 \v 6 You will destroy speakers of falsehood;
\q2 the man of blood and deceit Yahweh abhors.
\q1 \v 7 But I, in the greatness of your covenant faithfulness, I will come into your house;
\q2 I will bow down toward your temple of holiness in fear.
\b
\ts\*
\q1 \v 8 Yahweh, guide me in your righteousness because of my watchers;
\q2 straighten before my face your path.
\q1 \v 9 For there is no firmness in his mouth;
\q2 their inward being is destruction.
\q2 An open tomb is their throat;
\q2 their tongue they make smooth.
\q1 \v 10 Make them guilty, God;
\q2 may they fall due to their schemes!
\q1 Because of their many transgressions, drive them out,
\q2 for they rebel against you!
\q1 \v 11 But may all refuge seekers in you rejoice;
\q2 may they shout joyfully to eternity;
\q2 and may you cover over them;
\q2 and may lovers of your name exult in you.
\b
\ts\*
\q1 \v 12 For you, Yahweh, you bless the righteous,
\q2 you surround him {with} favor as a shield.
\ts\*

\c 6
\d For the director; with stringed instruments, on the eighth. A psalm of David.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 1 Yahweh, not in your nose, rebuke me,
\q2 and not in your rage, discipline me.
\q1 \v 2 Be gracious {to} me, Yahweh, for I am frail!
\q2 Heal me, Yahweh, for my bones are shaking!
\q1 \v 3 And my soul is very disturbed.
\q2 And you, Yahweh, until when?
\ts\*
\q1 \v 4 Turn back, Yahweh! Rescue my soul!
\q2 Save me for the sake of your covenant faithfulness!
\q1 \v 5 For in death, there is no remembrance of you.
\q2 In Sheol, who will thank you?
\b
\ts\*
\q1 \v 6 I am weary with my groaning.
\q2 During every night, I cause my bed to swim,
\q2 With my tears, my couch I melt.
\q1 \v 7 My eye has wasted away from grief,
\q2 it advances because of all my adversaries.
\b
\ts\*
\q1 \v 8 Turn away from me, all you doers of iniquity,
\q2 for Yahweh has heard the sound of my sobbing!
\q1 \v 9 Yahweh has heard my appeal for mercy,
\q2 Yahweh accepts my prayer.
\q1 \v 10 Let all my enemies be shamed and greatly disturbed.
\q2 Let them turn back. Let them be shamed {in} an instant.
\ts\*

\c 7
\d A musical composition of David, which he sang to Yahweh concerning the words of Cush the Benjamite.
\q \v 1 Yahweh my God, in you I have taken refuge;
\q2 save me from all my pursuers, and rescue me!
\q1 \v 2 Lest he rip my life apart like a lion,
\q2 tearing apart, and there is no one to rescue.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 3 Yahweh my God, if I have done this,
\q2 if there is wrong on my hands,
\q1 \v 4 if I have repaid evil {to} one {who was at} peace with me,
\q2 or senselessly rescued my adversary,
\ts\*
\q1 \v 5 let my enemy pursue my soul and overtake {it},
\q2 and let him trample my life to the ground
\q2 and cause my honor to live in the dust.
\qsSelah
\qs*


\ts\*
\q1 \v 6 Arise, Yahweh!
\q2 In your nose, be lifted with the rage of my adversaries!
\q2 And wake up for me!
\q1 You have ordered judgment.
\q1 \v 7 And an assembly of peoples surround you,
\q2 and over it return on high!
\q1 \v 8 Yahweh, adjudicate the peoples!
\q2 Judge me, Yahweh,
\q2 according to my righteousness and according to my integrity, Most High!
\q1 \v 9 May the evil of wicked ones end, and {would} you establish righteous ones.
\q2 The righteous God examines hearts and kidneys.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 10 My shield is with God,
\q2 the savior of the upright of heart.
\q1 \v 11 God is a righteous judge,
\q2 and a God {who is} indignant on every day.
\q1 \v 12 If he does not repent, his sword he will sharpen,
\q2 his bow he has bent and prepared.
\q1 \v 13 and for him he has prepared implements of death,
\q2 he has made his arrows into burning {arrows}.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 14 Behold he is pregnant with wickedness,
\q2 and he conceives trouble,
\q2 and he births lies.
\q1 \v 15 He digs a pit and hollows it out
\q2 and falls into the hole he has made.
\q1 \v 16 His trouble returns on his head,
\q2 and his violence comes down on the top of his head.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 17 I will thank Yahweh according to his righteousness,
\q2 and sing praise to the name of Yahweh, the Most High.
\ts\*

\c 8
\d For the chief musician; set to the gittith {style}. A psalm of David.
\q1 \v 1 Yahweh, our Lord, how magnificent is your name in all the earth,
\q2 {you} whose splendor is bestowed on the heavens.
\q1 \v 2 Out of the mouth of children and nursing ones you have established strength
\q2 because of your adversaries,
\q2 to cause the enemy and avenger to end.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 3 When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers,
\q2 the moon and the stars, which you have set in place,
\q1 \v 4 what is mankind that you remember him,
\q2 or the son of man that you pay attention to him?
\q1 \v 5 Yet you have made him to lack little from the heavenly beings,
\q2 and {with} glory and majesty you have crowned him.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 6 You made him rule over the works of your hands,
\q2 everything you have put under his feet:
\q3 \v 7 sheep and oxen—all of them,
\q3 and also the animals of the field,
\q3 \v 8 birds of the sky, and the fish of the sea,
\q3 the passers {on} the paths of the seas.

\ts\*
\q1 \v 9 Yahweh, our Lord,
\q2 how magnificent is your name in all the earth!
\ts\*

\c 9
\d For the chief musician; set to Muth Labben style. A psalm of David.
\q1 \v 1 I will thank Yahweh with all my heart,
\q2 I will recount all your wonders.
\q1 \v 2 I will rejoice and exult in you,
\q2 I will sing praise to your name, Most High!
\ts\*
\q1 \v 3 When my enemies turn back,
\q2 they stumble and perish from your face.
\q1 \v 4 For you have done my justice and my claim;
\q2 you have sat on your throne, a judge of righteousness!
\ts\*
\q1 \v 5 You rebuked nations; you destroyed the wicked;
\q2 you blotted out their name forever and ever.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 6 The enemy are finished—desolation forever,
\q2 and you pulled up cities.
\q2 {As for} them, their remembrance perished,
\ts\*
\q1 \v 7 but Yahweh will sit forever.
\q2 He has established his throne for justice,
\q1 \v 8 as for him, he will judge the world with righteousness,
\q2 and he will adjudicate for the peoples with fairness.
\q1 \v 9 And may Yahweh be a secure height for the oppressed,
\q2 a secure height for times with distress.
\q1 \v 10 And may the knowers of your name trust in you,
\q2 because you have not abandoned the seekers of you, Yahweh.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 11 Sing praises to Yahweh, the sitter {in} Zion!
\q1 Declare his deeds among the peoples
\q2 \v 12 for the seeker of {vengeance for} bloodshed remembered them,
\q2 he does not forget the cry of the afflicted ones.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 13 Have mercy on me, Yahweh! See my affliction from my haters,
\q2 O lifter of me from the gates of death,
\q1 \v 14 in order that I might recount all your praise
\q2 in the gates of the daughter of Zion.
\q2 I will rejoice in your salvation!
\ts\*
\q1 \v 15 The nations have sunk down into the pit they made;
\q3 their foot is caught in the net that they hid.
\q1 \v 16 Yahweh has revealed himself, he has done justice;
\q2 the wicked is ensnared by the work of his hands.
\qsHiggaion Selah
\qs*

\ts\*
\q1 \v 17 Wicked ones will turn back to Sheol,
\q2 all nations are forgetful of God.
\q1 \v 18 But the needy will not be forgotten eternally,
\q2 {nor} will the hope of the afflicted perish forever.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 19 Arise, Yahweh! Let not humanity prevail!
\q2 On your face let nations be judged.
\q1 \v 20 Put terror to them, Yahweh!
\q2 May nations know they are human.
\qsSelah

\c 10
\q
\v 1 Why, Yahweh, do you stand far-off?
\q2 {Why} do you hide in times of trouble?
\q1 \v 2 In arrogance, the wicked hotly pursue the afflicted;
\q2 may they be caught by the schemes that they have planned.
\q1 \v 3 Indeed, the wicked boasts about the desires of his soul
\q2 and he blesses the robber; he despises Yahweh.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 4 According to the haughtiness of his nose the wicked seeks not;
\q2 All his thoughts {are}, “{There is} no God.”
\q1 \v 5 His ways endure at every time;
\q2 your judgements are high from in front of him;
\q2 {as for} all his enemies, he snorts at them.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 6 He says in his heart, “I will not be shaken;
\q2 to generation and generation {it is I} who {will} not {be} in distress.”
\q1 \v 7 His mouth is full of curses and lies and oppression;
\q2 under his tongue are mischief and evil.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 8 He sits in ambush near the villages; in the secret places he murders the innocent;
\q2 his eyes stealthily watch for a helpless person.
\q1 \v 9 He ambushes in a secret place like a lion in cover;
\q2 he ambushes to seize the afflicted.
\q2 He seizes the afflicted by pulling in his net.
\q1 \v 10 He stoops, crouches,
\q2 and unfortunate people fall by his power.
\q1 \v 11 He says in his heart, “God has forgotten;
\q2 he has hidden his face; to perpetuity he sees not.”
\ts\*
\q1
\v 12 Arise, Yahweh! God, lift up your hand!
\q2 Do not forget the afflicted ones.
\q2 \v 13 Why does the wicked despise God?
\q2 He says in his heart, “You will not seek.”
\q1 \v 14 You have seen! Indeed, you notice mischief and vexation to take {it} in your hand.
\q2 The helpless person entrusts {himself} to you;
\q2 as for the orphan you, {even} you, are {his} helper.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 15 Break the arm of wicked and evil {people}.
\q2 May it seek his wickedness, {but} not find {it}.
\q1 \v 16 Yahweh is king forever and ever;
\q2 the nations have perished from his land.
\ts\*
\q1 \v 17 The desire of afflicted ones, you have heard, Yahweh;
\q2 you strengthen their heart, you cause your ear to attend:
\q1 \v 18 to judge the orphan and oppressed;
\q2 {that} mankind {who is} from the earth will never again terrify.
\ts\*

\c 11
\d For the chief musician. A psalm of David.
\q \v 1 To the music director. Of David.
\q1 In Yahweh I have taken refuge.
\q1 How can you say to my soul,
\q2 “Flutter {like} a bird to your mountain”?
\q \v 2 For behold, the wicked bend {their} bow;
\q they make ready their arrow on the string
\q to shoot in the darkness at the upright in heart.

\ts\*
\q \v 3 For if the foundations are ruined,
\q what can the righteous do?
\q \v 4 Yahweh is in his holy temple;
\q his eyes watch, his eyes examine the children of mankind.

\ts\*
\q \v 5 Yahweh examines both the righteous and the wicked,
\q but he hates those who love to do violence.
\q \v 6 He rains burning coals and brimstone upon the wicked;
\q a scorching wind will be their portion from his cup!
\q \v 7 For Yahweh is righteous, and he loves righteousness;
\q the upright will see his face.


\ts\*

\c 12
\d For the chief musician; set to the Sheminith. A psalm of David.
\q \v 1 Help, Yahweh, for the faithful ones have disappeared;
\q those who have integrity have vanished from the children of men.

\ts\*
\q \v 2 Everyone says empty words to his neighbor;
\q everyone speaks with flattering lips and a double heart.
\q \v 3 Yahweh, cut off all flattering lips,
\q every tongue declaring great things.
\q \v 4 These are those who have said, “With our tongues will we prevail.
\q When our lips speak, who can be master over us?”

\ts\*
\q \v 5 “Because of violence against the poor, because of the groans of the needy,
\q I will arise,” says Yahweh.
\q “I will provide the safety for which they long.”

\ts\*
\q \v 6 The words of Yahweh are pure words,
\q like silver purified in a furnace on the earth,
\q refined seven times.
\q \v 7 You are Yahweh! You keep them.
\q You preserve the godly people from this wicked generation and forever.
\q \v 8 The wicked walk on every side
\q when evil is exalted among the children of mankind.


\ts\*

\c 13
\d For the chief musician. A psalm of David.
\q \v 1 How long, Yahweh, will you keep forgetting about me?
\q How long will you hide your face from me?
\q \v 2 How long must I worry
\q and have grief in my heart all day?
\q How long will my enemy triumph over me?

\ts\*
\q \v 3 Look at me and answer me, Yahweh my God!
\q Give light to my eyes, or I will sleep in death.
\q \v 4 Do not let my enemy say, “I have defeated him,”
\q so that my enemy may not say, “I have prevailed over my adversary”; otherwise, my enemies will rejoice when I am brought down.

\ts\*
\q \v 5 But I have trusted in your covenant faithfulness;
\q my heart rejoices in your salvation.
\q \v 6 I will sing to Yahweh
\q because he has treated me very generously.


\ts\*

\c 14
\d For the chief musician. A psalm of David.
\q \v 1 To the chief musician A psalm of DavidA A fool says in his heart, “There is no God.”
\q They are corrupt and have done abominable iniquity;
\q there is no one who does good.

\ts\*
\q \v 2 Yahweh looks down from heaven on the children of mankind
\q to see if there are any who understand,
\q who seek after him.
\q \v 3 They have all turned away. Together they have become corrupt.
\q There is no one who does good, no, not one.

\ts\*
\q \v 4 Do they not know anything, those who commit iniquity,
\q those who eat up my people as they eat bread,
\q but who do not call on Yahweh?

\ts\*
\q \v 5 They tremble with dread,
\q for God is with the righteous assembly!
\q \v 6 You want to humiliate the poor person
\q even though Yahweh is his refuge.

\ts\*
\q \v 7 Oh, that the salvation of Israel would come from Zion!
\q When Yahweh brings back his people from the captivity,
\q then Jacob will rejoice and Israel will be glad!


\ts\*

\c 15
\d A psalm of David.
\q \v 1 To the chief musician A psalm of David Yahweh, who may stay in your tabernacle?
\q Who may live on your holy hill?
\q \v 2 Whoever walks blamelessly, does what is right
\q and speaks truth from his heart.

\ts\*
\q \v 3 He does not slander with his tongue,
\q he does not harm others,
\q and he does not insult his neighbor.

\ts\*
\q \v 4 The worthless person is despised in his eyes,
\q but he honors those who fear Yahweh.
\q He swears to his own disadvantage and does not take back his promises.
\q \v 5 He does not charge interest when he lends money.
\q He does not take bribes to testify against the innocent.
\q He who does these things will never be shaken.


\ts\*

\c 16
\d A michtam of David.
\q \v 1 A song of David Protect me, God, for I take refuge in you.
\q \v 2 You say to Yahweh, “You are my Lord; my goodness is nothing apart from you.
\q \v 3 As for the holy ones who are in the land, they are noble people; all my delight is in them.

\ts\*
\q \v 4 Their troubles will increase, those who seek out other gods. I will not pour out their drink offerings of blood
\q or lift up their names with my lips.

\ts\*
\q \v 5 Yahweh is the portion of my inheritance and my cup. You hold onto my lot.
\q \v 6 Measuring lines have been laid for me in pleasant places; surely a pleasing inheritance is mine.

\ts\*
\q \v 7 I will bless Yahweh, who counsels me; even at night my mind instructs me.
\q \v 8 I set Yahweh before me continually, for he is at my right hand, I will not be shaken.

\ts\*
\q \v 9 Therefore my heart rejoices, and my glory is joyful. Surely my flesh will dwell in security.
\q \v 10 For you will not abandon my soul to Sheol. You will not let your faithful one see the pit.

\ts\*
\q \v 11 You teach me the path of life; abundant joy is in your face; pleasures are at your right hand forever!”


\ts\*

\c 17
\d A prayer of David.
\q \v 1 A prayer of David Listen to my plea for justice, Yahweh; pay attention to my call for help!
\q Give ear to my prayer from lips without deceit.
\q \v 2 Let my vindication come from your presence; let your eyes see what is right!

\ts\*
\q \v 3 If you test my heart, if you come to me in the night,
\q you will purify me and will not find any evil plans; my mouth will not transgress.

\ts\*
\q \v 4 As for the deeds of mankind, it is at the word of your lips that I have kept myself from the ways of the lawless.
\q \v 5 My steps have held firmly to your tracks; my feet have not slipped.

\ts\*
\q \v 6 I call to you, for you answer me, God; turn your ear to me and listen when I speak.
\q \v 7 Show your covenant faithfulness in a wonderful way, you who save by your right hand those who take refuge in you from their enemies!

\ts\*
\q \v 8 Protect me like the apple of your eye; hide me under the shadow of your wings
\q \v 9 from the presence of the wicked ones who assault me, my enemies who surround me.
\q \v 10 They have no mercy on anyone; their mouths speak with pride.

\ts\*
\q \v 11 They have surrounded my steps. They set their eyes to strike me to the ground.
\q \v 12 They are like a lion eager for a victim, like a young lion crouching in hidden places.

\ts\*
\q \v 13 Arise, Yahweh! Attack them! Throw them down on their faces! Rescue my life from the wicked by your sword!
\q \v 14 Rescue me from men by your hand, Yahweh, from men of this world whose prosperity is in this life alone!
\q You will fill the bellies of your treasured ones with riches; they will have many children and will leave their wealth to their children.

\ts\*
\q \v 15 As for me, I will see your face in righteousness; I will be satisfied, when I awake, with a sight of you.


\ts\*

\c 18
\d For the chief musician. A psalm of David, the servant of Yahweh, when he sang to Yahweh the words of this song on the day that Yahweh rescued him from the hand of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. He sang:
\q \v 1 I love you, Yahweh, my strength.

\ts\*
\q \v 2 Yahweh is my rock, my fortress, the one who brings me to safety; he is my God, my rock; I take refuge in him.
\q He is my shield, the horn of my salvation, and my stronghold.
\q \v 3 I will call on Yahweh who is worthy to be praised, and I will be saved from my enemies.

\ts\*
\q \v 4 The cords of death surrounded me, and the rushing waters of worthlessness overwhelmed me.
\q \v 5 The cords of Sheol surrounded me; the snares of death trapped me.

\ts\*
\q \v 6 In my distress I called to Yahweh; I called for help to my God. He heard my voice from his temple;
\q my call for help went into his presence; it went into his ears.

\ts\*
\q \v 7 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations of the mountains also trembled
\q and were shaken because God was angry.
\q \v 8 Smoke went up from out of his nostrils, and blazing fire came out of his mouth. Coals were ignited by it.

\ts\*
\q \v 9 He opened the heavens and came down, and thick darkness was under his feet.
\q \v 10 He rode on a cherub and flew; he glided on the wings of the wind.

\ts\*
\q \v 11 He made darkness a tent around him, heavy rainclouds in the skies.
\q \v 12 Hailstones and coals of fire fell from the lightning before him.

\ts\*
\q \v 13 Yahweh thundered in the heavens! The voice of the Most High shouted hailstones and coals of fire
\f + \ft Some modern versions add after shouted, \fqa hailstones and coals of fire \fqa* this expression may be an accidental repetition from the previous verse. \f*
\q \v 14 He shot his arrows and scattered his enemies; many lightning bolts dispersed them.

\ts\*
\q \v 15 Then the water channels appeared;
\q1 the foundations of the world were laid bare
\q1 at your rebuke, Yahweh,
\q at the blast of the breath of your nostrils.

\q \v 1 Save me, God!
\q Yahweh, come quickly and help me.
\q \v 2 Let those who try to take my life
\q be ashamed and humiliated;
\q let them be turned back and brought to dishonor,
\q those who take pleasure in my pain.
\q \v 3 Let them be turned back because of their shame,
\q those who say, “Aha, aha.”

\ts\*
\q \v 4 Let all those who seek you rejoice and be glad in you;
\q let those who love your salvation always say,
\q “May God be praised.”

\q \v 3 Be to me a rock for refuge where I may always go;
\q you have given a command to save me,

\ts\*
\q \v 4 Rescue me, my God, out of the hand of the wicked,
\q out of the hand of the unrighteous and cruel.

\q \v 7 I am an example to many people;
\q you are my strong refuge.

\ts\*
\q \v 8 My mouth will be filled with your praise,
\q all the day with your honor.
\q \v 9 Do not throw me away in my time of old age;
\q do not abandon me when my strength fails.

\ts\*
\q \v 10 For my enemies are talking about me;
\q those who watch for my life are plotting together.
\q \v 11 They say, “God has forsaken him;

\ts\*
\q \v 12 God, do not be far from me;
\q my God, hurry to help me.
\q \v 13 Let them be put to shame and destroyed, those who are hostile to my life;
\q let them be covered with rebuke and dishonor, those who seek my hurt.

\ts\*
\q \v 14 But I will always hope in you
\q and will praise you more and more.
\q \v 15 My mouth will tell about your righteousness
\q and your salvation all the day,

\q \v 17 God, you have taught me from my youth;

\q \v 18 Indeed, even when I am old and gray-headed, God, do not forsake me,

\d A psalm of Asaph.
\q \v 1 A Psalm of Asaph. Surely God is good to Israel,
\q to those with a pure heart.
\q \v 2 But as for me, my feet almost slipped;
\q my steps almost were caused to slide out {from under me}
\q \v 3 because I was envious of the arrogant
\q {when} I saw the prosperity of the wicked.

\ts\*
\q \v 4 For {they have} no ropes until their death,
\q and their belly is fat.
\q \v 5 They {are} free from the trouble of man;
\q and with {the rest of} man they are not afflicted.

\ts\*
\q \v 6 Therefore pride is a necklace for them;
\q a garment of violence covers them.
\q \v 7 Their eyes bulge out from fatness;
\q the imaginations of {their} heart overflow.

\ts\*
\q \v 8 They mock and speak with evil of oppression;
\q they speak from an elevated place.
\q \v 9 They set their mouth in the heavens,
\q and their tongue goes through the earth.

\ts\*
\q \v 10 Therefore his people turn here,
\q and waters of a full {cup} are drained by them.
\q \v 11 And they say, “How does God know?
\q And is there knowledge in the Most High?”
\q \v 12 Behold, these wicked;
\q they are always at ease, they increase in wealth.

\ts\*
\q \v 13 Surely in vain I have kept my heart clean
\q and washed my hands in innocence.
\q \v 14 For I have been stricken all of the day,
\q and punished every morning.
\q \v 15 If I had said, “I will recount such things,”
\q Behold, I would have betrayed the generation of your children.

\ts\*
\q \v 16 And {when} I thought {how} to understand this,
\q it {was} troublesome in my eyes
\q \v 17 until I went into the sanctuaries of God;
\q {then} I discerned their end.

\ts\*
\q \v 18 Surely you set them in slippery places;
\q you make them fall to destruction.
\q \v 19 How they are {brought} to desolation as in a moment!
\q They come to an end, they perish, by terrors.
\q \v 20 Like a dream after {one} awakes;
\q2 Lord, when you rouse {yourself}, you will despise their image.

\ts\*
\q \v 21 When my heart was embittered,
\q and I was pierced in my kidneys,
\q\v 22 I {was} stupid and I was not knowing;
\q I was an animal with you.

\ts\*
\q \v 23 Yet I {am} continuously with you;
\q you hold {me} by my right hand.
\q \v 24 You guide me with your counsel,
\q and afterward you will take me {to} glory.

\ts\*
\q \v 25 Whom have I in heaven {but you}?
\q And besides you {there is} nothing on the earth I desire.
\q \v 26 My flesh and my heart fail,
\q {but} God {is} the rock of my heart and my portion forever.

\ts\*
\q \v 27 For behold, those who are far from you will perish;
\q you destroy every one being unfaithful to you.
\q \v 28 But {for} me, the closeness of God for me {is} good.
\q I have made the Lord Yahweh my refuge,
\q in order to recount all your works.

\q This Mount Zion, where you have dwelt.

\ts\*
\q \v 3 Lift up your feet to the perpetual ruins;

\q \v 4 Your adversaries have roared in the middle of your meeting place;

\q \v 5 It is perceived like one bringing on high, axes against a forest of trees.
\q
\q \v 6 And now, with axe and hammers,
\q they break down all its engravings.

\ts\*
\q \v 7 They have set your sanctuary on fire to the ground;
\q they have profaned the dwelling place of your name.
\q \v 8 They said in their hearts, “We will oppress them altogether.”
\q They have burned all of the meeting places of God in the land.

\q \v 9 We do not see signs for us;

\q Will the enemy treat your name with contempt forever?
\q \v 11 Why do you withdraw your hand, your right hand?
\q {Take it} from within the fold {of your garment and} destroy {them}.

\ts\*
\q \v 12 Yet God {is} my king from ancient times,
\q working acts of salvation in the midst of the earth.
\q \v 13 You divided the sea by your strength;
\q you smashed the heads of the sea monsters in the waters.

\ts\*
\q \v 14 You crushed the heads of leviathan;
\q you fed him to those living in the wilderness.
\q \v 15 You broke open springs and streams;
\q you dried up flowing rivers.

\ts\*
\q \v 16 The day is yours, and the night is yours also;
\q you set the sun and moon in place.
\q \v 17 You have set all the borders of the earth;

\q \v 1 A writing of Asaph Hear my teaching, my people,

\q \v 3 These are things that we have heard and learned,
\q things that our ancestors have told us.
\q \v 4 We will not keep them from their descendants.
\q We will tell the next generation about the praiseworthy deeds of Yahweh,
\q his strength, and the wonders that he has done.

\ts\*
\q \v 5 For he established covenant decrees in Jacob
\q and appointed a law in Israel.
\q He commanded our ancestors
\q that they were to teach them to their children.
\q \v 6 He commanded this so that the generation to come might know his decrees, the children not yet born,
\q who should tell them in turn to their own children.

\ts\*
\q \v 7 Then they would place their hope in God
\q and not forget his deeds
\q but keep his commandments.
\q \v 8 Then they would not be like their ancestors,

\ts\*
\q \v 9 The Ephraimites were armed with bows,

\ts\*
\q \v 12 They forgot the marvelous things he did in the sight of their ancestors
\q in the land of Egypt, in the land of Zoan.
\q \v 13 He divided the sea and led them across it;
\q he made the waters to stand like walls.
\q \v 14 In the daytime he led them with a cloud
\q and all the night with the light of fire.

\ts\*
\q \v 15 He split the rocks in the wilderness,
\q and he gave them water abundantly, enough to fill the depths of the sea.
\q \v 16 He made streams flow out of the rock
\q and made the water flow like rivers.

\ts\*
\q \v 17 Yet they continued to sin against him,
\q rebelling against the Most High in the wilderness.
\q \v 18 They challenged God in their hearts
\q by asking for food to satisfy their appetites.

\ts\*
\q \v 19 They spoke against God;
\q they said, “Can God really lay out a table for us in the wilderness?
\q \v 20 See, when he struck the rock, waters gushed out
\q and streams overflowed.
\q But can he give bread also?
\q Will he provide meat for his people?”

\ts\*
\q \v 21 When Yahweh heard this, he was angry;
\q so his fire burned against Jacob,
\q and his anger attacked Israel,
\q \v 22 because they did not believe in God
\q and did not trust in his salvation.

\ts\*
\q \v 23 Yet he commanded the skies above
\q and opened the doors of the sky.
\q \v 24 He rained down manna for them to eat,
\q and gave them the grain from heaven.
\q \v 25 People ate the bread of angels.
\q He sent them food in abundance.

\ts\*
\q \v 26 He caused the east wind to blow in the sky,
\q and by his power he guided the south wind.
\q \v 27 He rained down meat on them like dust,
\q birds as numerous as the sands of the sea.
\q \v 28 They fell in the middle of their camp,
\q all around their tents.

\ts\*
\q \v 29 So they ate and were full.
\q He gave them what they craved.
\q \v 30 But they had not yet filled up;

\q \v 31 Then God’s anger attacked them
\q and killed the strongest of them.
\q He brought down the young men of Israel.
\q \v 32 Despite this, they continued to sin
\q and did not believe his wonderful deeds.

\ts\*
\q \v 33 Therefore God cut short their days;
\q their years were filled with terror.
\q \v 34 Whenever God afflicted them, they would start to seek him,
\q and they would return and look earnestly for him.

\ts\*
\q \v 35 They would call to mind that God was their rock
\q and that the Most High God was their rescuer.
\q \v 36 But they would flatter him with their mouth
\q and lie to him with their words.
\q \v 37 For their hearts were not firmly fixed on him,
\q and they were not faithful to his covenant.

\ts\*
\q \v 38 Yet he, being merciful, forgave their iniquity and did not destroy them.
\q Yes, many times he held back his anger
\q and did not stir up all his wrath.

\ts\*
\q \v 39 He called to mind that they were made of flesh,
\q a wind that passes away and does not return.
\q \v 40 How often they rebelled against him in the wilderness
\q and grieved him in the barren regions!
\q \v 41 Again and again they challenged God
\q and offended the Holy One of Israel.

\ts\*
\q \v 42 They did not think about his power,
\q how he had rescued them from the enemy
\q \v 43 when he performed his terrifying signs in Egypt
\q and his wonders in the region of Zoan.

\ts\*
\q \v 44 He turned the Egyptians’ rivers to blood
\q so that they could not drink from their streams.
\q \v 45 He sent swarms of flies that devoured them
\q and frogs that overran their land.
\q \v 46 He gave their crops to the grasshopper
\q and their labor to the locust.

\ts\*
\q \v 47 He destroyed their vines with hail
\q and their sycamore trees with more hail.
\q \v 48 He rained hail on their cattle
\q and hurled lightning bolts at their livestock.
\q \v 49 The fierceness of his anger lashed out against them.
\q He sent wrath, fury, and trouble
\q like agents who bring disaster.

\ts\*
\q \v 50 He leveled a path for his anger;
\q he did not spare them from death
\q but gave them over to the plague.
\q \v 51 He killed all the firstborn in Egypt,
\q the firstborn of their strength in the tents of Ham.

\ts\*
\q \v 52 He led his own people out like sheep
\q and guided them through the wilderness like a flock.
\q \v 53 He led them secure and unafraid,
\q but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.

\ts\*
\q \v 54 Then he brought them to the border of his holy land,
\q to this mountain that his right hand acquired.
\q \v 55 He drove out the nations from before them
\q and assigned them their inheritance.
\q He settled the tribes of Israel in their tents.

\ts\*
\q \v 56 Yet they challenged and defied the Most High God
\q and did not keep his solemn commands.
\q \v 57 They were unfaithful and acted treacherously like their fathers;
\q they were as undependable as a faulty bow.

\ts\*
\q \v 58 For they made him angry with their high places
\q and provoked him to jealous anger with their idols.
\q \v 59 When God heard this, he was angry
\q and completely rejected Israel.

\ts\*
\q \v 60 He abandoned the sanctuary of Shiloh,
\q the tent where he had lived among people.
\q \v 61 He allowed his strength to be captured
\q and gave his glory into the enemy’s hand.

\ts\*
\q \v 62 He handed his people over to the sword,
\q and he was angry with his heritage.
\q \v 63 Fire devoured their young men,
\q and their young women had no wedding songs.

\ts\*
\q \v 64 Their priests fell by the sword,
\q and their widows could not weep.
\q \v 65 Then the Lord awakened as one from sleep,
\q like a warrior who shouts because of wine.
\q \v 66 He drove his adversaries back;
\q he put them to everlasting shame.

\ts\*
\q \v 67 He rejected the tent of Joseph,
\q and he did not chose the tribe of Ephraim.
\q \v 68 He chose the tribe of Judah
\q and Mount Zion that he loved.
\q \v 69 He built his sanctuary like the heavens,
\q like the earth that he has established forever.

\ts\*
\q \v 70 He chose David, his servant,
\q and took him from the sheepfolds.

\q \v 37 He brought the Israelites out with silver and gold;

\q \v 38 Egypt was glad when they went away,
\q for the fear of them had fallen upon them.
\q \v 39 He spread a cloud for a covering
\q and made a fire to light up the night.

\q \v 41 He split the rock, and waters gushed from it;

\q or proclaim in full all his praiseworthy deeds?

\ts\*
\q \v 3 Blessed are those who do what is right,
\q and whose deeds are always just.
\q \v 4 Call me to mind, Yahweh, when you show favor to your people;
\q help me when you save them.
\q \v 5 Then I will see the prosperity of your chosen,

\ts\*
\q \v 6 We have sinned like our ancestors;
\q we have done wrong, and we have done evil.
\q \v 7 Our fathers did not appreciate your marvelous deeds in Egypt;
\q they ignored your many acts of covenant faithfulness;
\q they were rebellious at the sea, the Sea of Reeds.

\ts\*
\q \v 8 Nevertheless, he saved them for his name’s sake
\q so that he might reveal his power.
\q \v 9 He rebuked the Sea of Reeds, and it dried up.
\q Then he led them through the depths, as through a wilderness.

\ts\*
\q \v 10 He saved them from the hand of those who hated them,
\q and he rescued them from the hand of the enemy.
\q \v 11 But the waters covered their adversaries;
\q not one of them survived.
\q \v 12 Then they believed his words,
\q and they sang his praise.

\ts\*
\q \v 13 But they quickly forgot what he had done;
\q they did not wait for his instructions.
\q \v 14 They had insatiable cravings in the wilderness,
\q and they challenged God in the desert.
\q \v 15 So he gave them what they requested,
\q2 but he sent a horrible disease upon them.

\ts\*
\q \v 16 In the camp they became jealous of Moses
\q and Aaron, the holy priest of Yahweh.
\q \v 17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan
\q and covered the followers of Abiram.
\q \v 18 Fire broke out among them;
\q the fire consumed the wicked.

\ts\*
\q \v 19 They made a calf at Horeb
\q and worshiped a cast metal figure.
\q \v 20 They traded the glory of God
\q for the image of a bull that eats grass.
\q \v 21 They forgot God their Savior,
\q who had done great deeds in Egypt.

\ts\*
\q \v 22 He had done wonderful things in the land of Ham
\q and mighty acts at the Sea of Reeds.
\q \v 23 So he said he would destroy them—
\q had not Moses, his chosen one, stood in the breach before him,
\q to turn away his anger from destroying them.

\ts\*
\q \v 24 Then they despised the fruitful land;
\q they did not believe his promise,
\q \v 25 but grumbled in their tents,
\q and did not obey Yahweh.

\ts\*
\q \v 26 Therefore he raised his hand and swore to them
\q that he would let them die in the desert,
\q \v 27 scatter their descendants among the nations,
\q and scatter them in foreign lands.

\ts\*
\q \v 28 They worshiped the Baal of Peor
\q and ate the sacrifices offered to the dead.
\q \v 29 They provoked him to anger with their actions,
\q and a plague broke out among them.

\ts\*
\q \v 30 Then Phinehas rose to intervene,
\q and the plague subsided.
\q \v 31 It was counted to him as a righteous deed
\q to all generations forever.

\ts\*
\q \v 32 They also angered Yahweh at the waters of Meribah,
\q and Moses suffered because of them.
\q \v 33 They made Moses bitter,
\q and he spoke rashly.
\q \v 34 They did not destroy the nations
\q as Yahweh had commanded them,
\q \v 35 but they mingled with the nations
\q and learned their ways
\q \v 36 and worshiped their idols,
\q which became a snare to them.

\ts\*
\q \v 37 They sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons.
\q \v 38 They shed innocent blood,
\q the blood of their sons and of their daughters,
\q whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan,
\q desecrating the land with blood.
\q \v 39 They were defiled by their deeds;
\q in their actions they were like prostitutes.

\ts\*
\q \v 40 So Yahweh was angry with his people,
\q and he despised his own people.
\q \v 41 He gave them into the hand of the nations,
\q and those who hated them ruled over them.

\ts\*
\q \v 42 Their enemies oppressed them,
\q and they were brought into subjection to their authority.
\q \v 43 Many times he came to help them,
\q but they kept rebelling
\q and were brought low by their own sin.

\ts\*
\q \v 44 Nevertheless, he paid attention to their distress
\q when he heard their cry for help.
\q \v 45 He called to mind his covenant with them
\q and relented because of his steadfast love.
\q \v 46 He caused all their conquerers
\q to have pity on them.
\ts\*
\q \v 47 Save us, Yahweh, our God.
\q Gather us from among the nations
\q so that we may give thanks to your holy name
\q and glory in your praises.

\q \v 4 They wandered in the wilderness on a desert road

\ts\*
\q \v 11 This was because they had rebelled against God’s word
\q and rejected the instruction of the Most High.
