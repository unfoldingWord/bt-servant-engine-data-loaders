\s1 How God Created Everything
\sr 1:1-2:3
\p
\v 1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
\v 2 Now the earth was formless and empty, and darkness {was} over the surface of the deep {waters}, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters.

\ts\*
\v 3 Then God said, “Let there be light.” And there was light.
\v 4 And God saw the light, that {it was} good. Then God separated between the light and the darkness.
\v 5 And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. Then there was evening, and there was morning, one day.

\ts\*
\p
\v 6 Then God said, “Let there be an expanse in the middle of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters.”
\v 7 So God made the expanse and separated between the waters that {were} under the expanse and the waters that {were} above the expanse. And it was so.
\v 8 And God called the expanse Heavens. Then there was evening, and there was morning, the second day.

\ts\*
\p
\v 9 Then God said, “Let the waters under the heavens be gathered to one place, and let the dry ground appear.” And it was so.
\v 10 And God called the dry ground Land, and the gathered waters he called Seas. And God saw that {it was} good.

\ts\*
\p
\v 11 Then God said, “Let the land sprout vegetation: {every} plant yielding seed, {every} fruit tree bearing fruit according to its kind, that {has} its seed inside it, on the earth.” And it was so.
\v 12 So the land brought out vegetation, {every} plant yielding seed according to its kind, and {every} tree bearing fruit that {has} its seed inside it, according to its kind. And God saw that {it was} good.
\v 13 Then there was evening, and there was morning, the third day.

\ts\*
\p
\v 14 Then God said, “Let there be lights in the expanse of the heavens to separate between the day and the night. And let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years.
\v 15 And let them be as lights in the expanse of the heavens to shine on the earth.” And it was so.

\ts\*
\v 16 So God made the two great lights, the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night, and the stars.
\v 17 And God set them in the expanse of the heavens to shine on the earth,
\v 18 and to rule over the day and over the night, and to separate between the light and the darkness. And God saw that {it was} good.
\v 19 Then there was evening, and there was morning, the fourth day.

\ts\*
\p
\v 20 Then God said, “Let the waters swarm {with} swarm{s} of living creature{s}, and let bird{s} fly above the earth across the face of the expanse of the sky.”
\v 21 So God created the great sea creatures and every living creature that moves which the waters swarm with according to their kind, and every winged bird according to its kind. And God saw that {it was} good.

\ts\*
\v 22 Then God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the waters in the seas, and let the bird{s} multiply on the earth.”
\v 23 Then there was evening, and there was morning, the fifth day.

\ts\*
\p
\v 24 Then God said, “Let the land bring forth {every} living creature according to its kind: livestock and {every} crawling creature and {every} living thing of the earth, {each} according to its kind.” And it was so.
\v 25 So God made {every} creature of the earth according to its kind, and the livestock according to its kind, and every crawling creature of the ground according to its kind. And God saw that {it was} good.

\ts\*
\p
\v 26 Then God said, “Let us make man in our image, according to our likeness, and let them rule over the fish of the sea and over the bird{s} of the sky and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every moving creature moving on the earth.”
\v 27 Then God created man in his image. In the image of God he created him; male and female he created them.

\ts\*
\p
\v 28 Then God blessed them, and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth and subdue it. And rule over the fish of the sea and over the bird{s} of the sky and over every living thing that moves on the earth.”
\v 29 Then God said, “Behold, I have given to you every plant {that} yields seed that {is} on the surface of the whole earth and every tree that {has} tree fruit {that} yields seed inside it. They will be yours for food.

\ts\*
\v 30 And to every living thing of the earth, and to every bird of the sky, and to every{thing} moving on the earth that {has} living breath in it, {I have given} every green plant for food.” And it was so.

\p
\v 31 Then God saw all that he had made, and behold, {it was} very good. Then there was evening, and there was morning, the sixth day.

\ts\*

\c 2
\p
\v 1 So the heavens and the earth were completed, and all their hosts.
\v 2 And by the seventh day God had completed his work that he had done, so he rested on the seventh day from all his work that he had done.
\v 3 And God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because on it he rested from all his work of creating that God had done.

\ts\*
\s1 Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden
\sr 2:4-25
\p
\v 4 These {are} the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created, in the day {when} Yahweh God made the earth and the heavens,
\v 5 and every shrub of the field had not yet appeared on the earth, and every plant of the field had not yet sprung up, because Yahweh God had not caused it to rain on the earth, and there was no man to work the ground.
\v 6 But mist came up from the earth and watered all of the surface of the ground.

\ts\*
\v 7 Then Yahweh God formed the man {out of} dust from the ground, and he breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a living being.

\p
\v 8 Now Yahweh God had planted a garden in Eden, in the east, and there he put the man whom he had formed.

\ts\*
\v 9 And Yahweh God had made to grow from the ground every tree {that} is pleasant to the sight and good for food, and the tree of life in the middle of the garden, and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.

\p
\v 10 And a river was going out from Eden to water the garden, and from there it divided and became four head{water}s.

\ts\*
\v 11 The name of the first {is} Pishon. It winds through all of the land of Havilah, where gold {is}.
\v 12 And the gold of that land {is} good. Bdellium and onyx stone {are} there.

\ts\*
\v 13 And the name of the second river {is} Gihon. It winds through all of the land of Cush.
\v 14 And the name of the third river {is} Tigris. It goes east of Asshur. And the fourth river {is} Euphrates.

\ts\*
\p
\v 15 And Yahweh God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to work it and tend it.
\v 16 Then Yahweh God commanded the man, saying, “From every tree of the garden you may freely eat,
\v 17 but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, because on the day you eat from it you will surely die.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 18 Then Yahweh God said, “{It is} not good {for} the man to be alone. I will make a suitable helper for him.”
\v 19 Now Yahweh God had formed from the ground every living thing of the field and every bird of the sky. So he brought {them} to the man to see what he would call them, and whatever the man called a living creature, that {was} its name.
\v 20 And the man gave names to all the livestock and to the bird{s} of the sky and to every living thing of the field, but for the man a suitable helper was not found.

\ts\*
\p
\v 21 So Yahweh God caused a deep sleep to fall on the man. And {while} he was sleeping, then he took one of his ribs and closed up its place {with} flesh.
\v 22 Then Yahweh God built the rib which he had taken from the man into a woman, and he brought her to the man.
\v 23 And the man said,
\q1
“This {one} now {is} bone from my bones
\q2
and flesh from my flesh!
\q1
She will be called ‘woman,’
\q2
because {it was} from a man {that} she was taken.”
\ts\*
\m
\v 24 For that {reason} a man will leave his father and his mother, and he will cling to his wife, and they will become one flesh.
\v 25 And the man and his wife were both naked, but they were not ashamed.

\c 3
\s1 The First Sin and God’s Judgment
\sr 3:1-24
\p
\v 1 Now the serpent was more crafty than every living thing of the field that Yahweh God had made. And he said to the woman, “Did God really say, ‘You must not eat from any tree of the garden’?”
\v 2 Then the woman said to the serpent, “We may eat from the fruit of the tree{s} of the garden,
\v 3 except from the fruit of the tree that {is} in the middle of the garden. God said, ‘You must not eat from it, and you must not touch it, or else you will die!’”

\ts\*
\v 4 But the serpent said to the woman, “You will not surely die.
\v 5 For God knows that on the day you eat from it, then your eyes will be opened, and you will be like God in knowing good and evil.”
\v 6 And the woman saw that the tree {was} good for food, and that it {was} pleasant to the eyes, and {that} the tree was desirable for gaining wisdom. So she took some of its fruit and ate {it}. Then she also gave {some} to her husband with her, and he ate {it}.

\ts\*
\v 7 Then the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they {were} naked. So they sewed fig leaves together and made aprons for themselves.

\p
\v 8 Then they heard the sound of Yahweh God walking in the garden in the breeze of the day, but the man and his wife hid from the presence of Yahweh God among the tree{s} of the garden.

\ts\*
\v 9 So Yahweh God called to the man and said to him, “Where {are} you?”
\v 10 And he said, “I heard your sound in the garden, but I was afraid because I {was} naked, so I hid.”
\v 11 Then he said, “Who told you that you {were} naked? Did you eat from the tree that I commanded you not to eat from?”

\ts\*
\v 12 Then the man said, “The woman whom you gave {to be} with me, she gave me {fruit} from the tree, and I ate {it}.”
\v 13 Then Yahweh God said to the woman, “What {is} this you have done?” And the woman said, “The serpent deceived me, so I ate {it}.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 14 Then Yahweh God said to the serpent,
\q1
“Because you have done this,
\q2
you are cursed above all the livestock
\q2
and above every living thing of the field.
\q1
You will move on your belly,
\q2
and you will eat dust
\q2
all the days of your life.
\q1 \v 15 I will also put hostility
\q2
between you and the woman,
\q2
and between your offspring and her offspring.
\q1
He will strike you {on} the head, and you will strike him {on} the heel.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 16 To the woman he said,
\q1
“To multiply I will multiply your pain and your childbearing;
\q2
in pain you will bear children.
\q1
Yet your desire {will be} for your husband,
\q2
and he will rule over you.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 17 Then to the man he said, “Since you listened to the voice of your wife and ate from the tree that I commanded you, saying, ‘You must not eat from it,’
\q1
the ground is cursed because of you.
\q2
By painful toil you will eat {from} it
\q2
all the days of your life.
\q1 \v 18 And it will produce thorn{s} and thistle{s} for you,
\q2
and you will eat the plant{s} of the field{s}.
\q1 \v 19 By the sweat of your nose
\q2
you will eat bread,
\q1
until you return to the ground,
\q2
since from it you were taken.
\q1
 For you {are} dust,
\q2
and to dust you will return.”
\ts\*
\m
\p
\v 20 Then the man called the name of his wife Eve, because she was the mother of all the living.
\v 21 Then Yahweh God made garments of {animal} skins for Adam and his wife, and he clothed them.

\ts\*
\p
\v 22 Then Yahweh God said, “Behold, the man has become like one of us in knowing good and evil. And now he must not reach out his hand and also take {fruit} from the tree of life and eat it and live forever!”
\v 23 So Yahweh God sent him out of the Garden of Eden to work the ground which he had been taken from.
\v 24 And after he drove the man out, then he placed on the east side of the Garden of Eden cherubim {angels} and a flaming sword that was turning in every direction to guard the way of the tree of life.

\s1 Cain and Abel — the First Murder
\sr 4:1-16
\p
\v 1 Then the man knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain. And she said, “I have obtained a man with Yahweh!”
\v 2 Then she continued on to bear his brother Abel. Now Abel became a keeper of flock{s}, and Cain became a worker of the ground.

\ts\*
\v 3 And it happened in the course of days that Cain brought some of the fruit of the ground {as} an offering to Yahweh.
\v 4 And Abel also brought some of the firstborn of his flock{s} and some of their fat. And Yahweh looked {favorably} on Abel and his offering.
\v 5 But he did not look {favorably} on Cain and his offering. So Cain burned with intense anger, and his face fell.

\ts\*
\v 6 Then Yahweh said to Cain, “Why are you burning with anger? And why is your face fallen?
\v 7 If you do right, will {you} not {be} accepted? But if you do not do right, sin is crouching at the door, and its desire {is} for you, but you must rule over it.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 8 Then Cain spoke to Abel his brother. And it happened while they were in the field, then Cain rose up against Abel his brother and killed him.

\p
\v 9 Then Yahweh said to Cain, “Where {is} Abel your brother?” And he replied, “I do not know. Am I my brother’s keeper?”

\ts\*
\v 10 Then he said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother’s blood is crying out to me from the ground!
\v 11 So now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s blood from your hand.
\v 12 When you work the ground, it will not continue to yield its strength for you. You will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 13 Then Cain said to Yahweh, “My punishment {is} greater than I can bear.
\v 14 Behold, today you are driving me from the surface of the ground, and I will be hidden from your presence. And I will be a fugitive and a wanderer on the earth, and it will be {that} everyone who finds me will kill me!”
\v 15 Then Yahweh said to him, “For that {reason}, anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over!” Then Yahweh put a mark on Cain so that everyone who found him would not strike him.

\ts\*
\v 16 Then Cain went away from the presence of Yahweh and lived in the land of Nod, east of Eden.

\s1 Cain’s Descendants
\sr 4:17-24
\p
\v 17 Then Cain knew his wife, and she conceived and bore Enoch. And he was building a city, so he called the name of the city after the name of his son Enoch.

\ts\*
\v 18 Then to Enoch was born Irad, and Irad fathered Mehujael, and Mehujael fathered Methushael, and Methushael fathered Lamech.

\p
\v 19 Then Lamech took for himself two wives. The name of the one {was} Adah, and the name of the second {was} Zillah.

\ts\*
\v 20 And Adah bore Jabal. He was the father of {those} who live {in} tents and own livestock.
\v 21 And the name of his brother {was} Jubal. He was the father of all who play harps and flutes.

\p
\v 22 And Zillah also bore Tubal Cain, who forged all {kinds} of tools out of bronze and iron. And the sister of Tubal Cain {was} Naamah.

\ts\*
\p
\v 23 And Lamech said to his wives,
\q1
“Adah and Zillah, hear my voice.
\q2
Wives of Lamech, give ear to my word{s}:
\q1
For I killed a man for my wound,
\q2
even a young man for my bruise.
\q1 \v 24 If Cain is avenged seven times,
\q2
then Lamech {is avenged} seventy-seven times!”

\ts\*

\s1 Seth and His Son Enosh
\sr 4:25-26
\p
\v 25 Then Adam knew his wife again, and she bore a son, and she called his name Seth, because {she had said}, “God has appointed for me another offspring in place of Abel, since Cain killed him.”
\v 26 And to Seth also a son was born, and he called his name Enosh.
\p
Then {people} began to call on the name of Yahweh.

\v 1 This {is} the written account of the generations of Adam: On the day God created man{kind}, he made him in the likeness of God.
\v 2 He created them male and female, and he blessed them and called their name “man{kind}” on the day they were created.

\ts\*

\sr 6:1-8
\p
\v 1 And it happened when mankind began to multiply on the surface of the earth and daughters were born to them,
\v 2 then the sons of God saw the daughters of mankind, that they {were} beautiful, so they took wives for themselves from any {of them} that they chose.
\v 3 Then Yahweh said, “My Spirit will not strive with mankind forever, because they {are} indeed flesh. Therefore their days will be 120 years.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 4 The Nephilim were on the earth in those days and also after that, when the sons of God went to the daughters of mankind, and they bore children for them. They {were} the mighty {ones} who {were} from long ago, the men of renown.

\ts\*
\p
\v 5 And Yahweh saw that the wickedness of mankind {was} great on the earth, and that every inclination of the thoughts of their hearts {was} only evil all day long.
\v 6 So Yahweh was sorry that he had made mankind on the earth, and he was grieved in his heart.

\ts\*
\v 7 Then Yahweh said, “I will wipe away mankind whom I created off the surface of the ground, both mankind and animals, and crawling creatures and the birds of the sky, because I am sorry that I made them.”

\s1 Noah Prepares for the Flood

\p
\v 9 These {are} the generations of Noah: He {was} a righteous man. He was without blemish in his generation. Noah walked with God.
\v 10 And Noah fathered three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.

\ts\*
\p
\v 11 Now the earth was corrupt before God, and the earth was filled {with} violence.
\v 12 And God saw the earth, and behold, it was corrupted, because all flesh on the earth had corrupted its way.

\ts\*
\v 13 So God said to Noah, “The end of all flesh has come before me, because the earth is filled {with} violence because of them. So behold, I am destroying them with the earth.
\v 14 Make an ark for yourself out of gopher wood. Make the ark {with} rooms, and cover it inside and outside with a covering.
\v 15 And this {is} how you must make it: the length of the ark {must be} 300 cubits, its width fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits.

\ts\*
\v 16 Make a window for the ark and finish it to within one cubit from the top. And put the door of the ark in its side. Make a lower, a second, and a third {deck}.
\v 17 And I, behold, I am bringing floodwaters on the earth to destroy all flesh that {has} the breath of life in it from under the heavens. Everything that {is} on the earth will expire!

\ts\*
\v 18 But I will establish my covenant with you, so you must go into the ark, you and your sons and your wife and the wives of your sons with you.
\v 19 And from every living {creature}, from all flesh, you must bring two from each {kind} into the ark to keep alive with you. They must be male and female.

\ts\*
\v 20 From the birds according to their kinds, and from the animals according to their kinds, from every moving creature of the ground according to its kind, two from every {kind} will come to you to keep alive.
\v 21 And you must take with you some of every food that is eaten and store it with you, and it will be food for you and for them.”

\s1 Yahweh Sends the Flood
\sr 7:1-23
\p
\v 1 Then Yahweh said to Noah, “Go into the ark, you and all your household, because I have seen {that} you {are} righteous before me in this generation.
\v 2 From every clean animal take with you seven pairs, a male and its female, and from {every} animal that {is} not clean {take} two, a male and its female,
\v 3 also from {every} bird of the sky {take} seven pairs, male and female, to keep {their} offspring alive on the surface of the whole earth,

\ts\*
\v 4 because in seven more days I will cause it to rain on the earth {for} forty days and forty nights, and I will wipe every living thing that I have made off the surface of the ground.”
\v 5 Then Noah did all that Yahweh had commanded him.

\ts\*
\p
\v 6 Now Noah {was} a son of 600 years when the floodwaters came on the earth.
\v 7 And Noah and his sons and his wife and the wives of his sons went with him into the ark from the presence of the waters of the flood.

\ts\*
\v 8 {Pairs} from the clean animal{s} and from the animal{s} that are not clean and from the bird{s} and everything that moves on the ground
\v 9 went two {by} two to Noah into the ark, male and female, just as God had commanded Noah.

\p
\v 10 And it happened, after the seven days, then the waters of the flood came on the earth.

\ts\*
\v 11 In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, in the second month, on the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep burst open, and the windows of the heavens were opened,
\v 12 so that the rain fell on the earth forty days and forty nights.

\ts\*
\p
\v 13 On that same day Noah and Shem and Ham and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and the wife of Noah and the three wives of his sons with them, went into the ark,
\v 14 they and every living thing according to its kind, and every livestock according to its kind, and every moving creature moving on the earth according to its kind, and every bird according to its kind, every bird of every wing.

\ts\*
\v 15 So they went to Noah into the ark, two {by} two from all flesh which {has} in it the breath of life.
\v 16 And those that went in {were} male and female from all flesh; they went in just as God had commanded him. Then Yahweh shut him in.

\ts\*
\p
\v 17 Then the flood came on the earth {for} forty days, and the waters increased and lifted the ark so that it rose up off the earth.
\v 18 And the waters rose and increased greatly on the earth, and the ark went on the surface of the waters.

\ts\*
\v 19 And the waters rose very greatly on the earth, so that all the high mountains that {were} under the entire heavens were covered.
\v 20 The waters rose fifteen cubits above {them}, so that the mountains were covered.

\ts\*
\v 21 Then all flesh that moved on the earth expired, including the birds and the livestock and the living things and all the swarming things swarming on the earth, and all mankind.
\v 22 Everything that {had} the breath of the spirit of life in its nostrils, everything that {lived} on dry land, died.

\ts\*
\v 23 So he wiped away every living thing that {was} on the surface of the ground, including mankind and livestock and crawling creatures and also the birds of the sky. So they were wiped off the earth, and only Noah was left and {those} who {were} with him in the ark.

\v 10 Then he waited another seven days and again sent out the dove from the ark.

\s1 Abram and Hagar Have Ishmael
\sr 16:1-16
\p
\v 1 Now Sarai, the wife of Abram, had not born {children} for him, but she had an Egyptian maidservant, and her name {was} Hagar.
\v 2 So Sarai said to Abram, “Behold please, Yahweh has prevented me from bearing {children}. Please go to my maidservant. Perhaps I can be built up from her.” And Abram listened to the voice of Sarai.
\v 3 So Sarai, the wife of Abram, took Hagar, her Egyptian maidservant, at the end of ten years that Abram had lived in the land of Canaan, and gave her to Abram her husband as a wife for him.
\v 4 Then he went to Hagar, and she conceived. And she saw that she had conceived, and her mistress was despised in her eyes.

\ts\*
\p
\v 5 Then Sarai said to Abram, “My wrong {is} on you! I myself put my maidservant into your arms, but she sees that she has conceived, and I am despised in her eyes! May Yahweh judge between me and you!”
\v 6 Then Abram said to Sarai, “Behold, your maidservant {is} in your hand. Do to her what {is} good in your eyes.” Then Sarai afflicted her, and she fled from her face.

\ts\*
\p
\v 7 Then the angel of Yahweh found her at a spring of water in the wilderness, at the spring beside the road of Shur.
\v 8 And he said, “Hagar, maidservant of Sarai, where have you come from, and where are you going?” And she said, “I am fleeing from the face of Sarai, my mistress.”

\ts\*
\v 9 Then the angel of Yahweh said to her, “Return to your mistress and submit under her hands.”

\p
\v 10 Then the angel of Yahweh said to her, “I will greatly increase your offspring, so that they cannot be counted, because of their abundance.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 11 Then the angel of Yahweh said to her,
\q1
“Behold, {you are} pregnant,
\q2
and you will bear a son,
\q1
and you will call his name Ishmael,
\q2
because Yahweh has listened to your misery.
\q1 \v 12 And he will be a wild donkey of a man,

his hand against everyone
\q2
and the hand of everyone against him,

and he will live in the faces

\s1 More Details about God’s Covenant with Abram, including Circumcision
\sr 17:1-27
\p
\v 1 Then Abram was a son of ninety-nine years, and Yahweh appeared to Abram and said to him, “I {am} God Almighty. Walk before me and be without blemish.
\v 2 And I will make my covenant between me and you, and I will multiply you very greatly.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 3 Then Abram fell on his face, and God spoke with him, saying,
\v 4 “Me, behold, my covenant will be with you, and you shall be the father of a multitude of nations.
\v 5 And your name will not be called Abram anymore, but your name will be Abraham, because I have made you the father of a multitude of nations.
\v 6 And I will make you very, very fruitful, and I will make you into nations, and kings will come from you.

\ts\*
\v 7 And I will establish my covenant between me and you and your offspring after you throughout their generations as an eternal covenant, to be God to you and to your offspring after you.
\v 8 And I will give to you and to your offspring after you the land of your sojournings, all the land of Canaan, as an eternal possession, and I will be God to them.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 9 Then God said to Abraham, “And you, you must keep my covenant, you and your offspring after you throughout their generations.
\v 10 This {is} my covenant which you must keep, between me and you and your offspring after you: Every male among you must be circumcised.
\v 11 Indeed, you must be circumcised {in} the flesh of your foreskins, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and you.

\ts\*
\v 12 So a son of eight days must be circumcised, every male among you throughout your generations, the one born in {your} house and the one bought with money from any son of a foreigner, who {is} not your offspring.
\v 13 He must surely be circumcised, the one born in your house and the one bought with your money. So my covenant will be in your flesh as an eternal covenant.
\v 14 And {as for} an uncircumcised male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, indeed that person must be cut off from his people; he has broken my covenant.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 15 Then God said to Abraham, “{As for} Sarai your wife, do not call her name Sarai, because her name {will be} Sarah.
\v 16 And I will bless her, and I will also give to you a son from her. Indeed, I will bless her and she will become nations; kings of peoples will come from her.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 17 Then Abraham fell on his face, and he laughed and said in his heart, “Will {a child} be born to a son of 100 years? And will Sarah, who is a daughter of ninety years, bear {a child}?”
\v 18 Then Abraham said to God, “If only Ishmael might live before you!”

\ts\*
\v 19 Then God said, “No, Sarah your wife is bearing a son for you, and you will call his name Isaac. And I will establish my covenant with him as an eternal covenant for his offspring after him.

\p
\v 20 “And as for Ishmael, I have heard you. Behold, I will bless him, and I will make him fruitful and multiply him very greatly. He will father twelve rulers, and I will make him into a great nation.
\v 21 However, my covenant I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear for you by this time in the next year.”

\ts\*
\v 22 Then he finished speaking with him, and God went up from Abraham.

\p
\v 23 Then Abraham took Ishmael his son and all those born in his house and everyone bought with his money, every male among the men of Abraham’s house, and he circumcised the flesh of their foreskins on that very day, just as God had told him.

\ts\*
\v 24 And Abraham {was} a son of 99 years when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin,
\v 25 and Ishmael his son {was} a son of thirteen years when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.
\v 26 On that very day Abraham was circumcised, and Ishmael his son.

\v 2 And he lifted his eyes and looked, and behold, three men were standing nearby him. And {when} he saw {them}, he ran from the entrance of the tent to meet them and bowed himself to the ground,

\ts\*
\v 3 and he said, “My lords, if I have found favor in your eyes, please do not pass by your servant.
\v 4 Please let a little water be brought. Then you can wash your feet, and rest yourselves under the tree.
\v 5 And I will bring a morsel of bread so that you can refresh your hearts before you go away, since you have come to your servant.” And they said, “Alright, do as you have said.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 6 Then Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah and said, “Hurry! {Prepare} three seahs of fine flour. Knead {it} and make loaves.”
\v 7 Then Abraham ran to the herd and selected a tender and choice calf. Then he gave it to a servant and he hurried to prepare it.
\v 8 Then he took curds and milk and the calf that he had prepared, and he set it before them. Then he stood by them under the tree and they ate.

\v 9 Then they said to him, “Where {is} Sarah your wife?” And he said, “Behold, in the tent.”

\ts\*
\v 11 Now Abraham and Sarah {were} old, advanced in days; the way of women had ceased to be with Sarah.
\v 12 So Sarah laughed within herself and said, “After I am worn out, will I have pleasure? And my lord {is} old!”

\ts\*
\v 13 Then Yahweh said to Abraham, “Why {is it} that Sarah laughed, saying, ‘Will I really bear {a child} when I am old?’
\v 14 Is anything too hard for Yahweh? At the appointed time I will return to you, at the time of life, and Sarah will have a son.”

\v 18 And Abraham will surely become a great and mighty nation, and in him all the nations of the earth will be blessed.
\v 19 For I have known him so that he will command his children and his house after him, and they will keep the way of Yahweh by doing righteousness and justice, so that Yahweh will bring about for Abraham what he has said to him.”

\ts\*

\v 24 Suppose there are fifty righteous in the city. Will you really sweep away and not spare the place for the sake of the fifty righteous who {are} in it?
\v 25 Far be it from you to do something like that, killing the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous are like the wicked! Far be it from you! Will the one who judges all the earth not do justice?”
\v 26 Then Yahweh said, “If I find in Sodom fifty righteous in the city, then I will spare the whole place for their sake.”

\v 27 Then Abraham spoke up and said, “Behold, please, I have taken it upon myself to speak to my Lord, although I {am} dust and ashes.
\v 28 Suppose the fifty righteous lack five? Will you destroy the whole city because of five?” And he said, “I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there.”

\v 29 Then he continued again to speak to him and said, “Suppose forty are found there?” And he said, “I will not do it for the sake of the forty.”

\s1 Yahweh Destroys the Cities of Sodom and Gomorrah

\v 1 Then the two angels came to Sodom in the evening, and Lot was sitting at the gate of Sodom. And Lot saw them, and he got up to meet them and bowed down {with} nose to the ground.
\v 2 Then he said, “Behold, please, my lords: Please turn aside to the house of your servant and spend the night, and wash your feet. Then you can get up early and go on your way.” But they said, “No, rather we will spend the night in the street.”
\v 3 But he urged them strongly, so that they turned aside with him and entered into his house. Then he prepared a feast for them, and he baked unleavened bread, and they ate.

\ts\*
\p
\v 4 Before they lay down, then the men of the city, the men of Sodom, surrounded the house, from the young and to the old, all the people from the edge{s}.
\v 5 Then they called to Lot and said to him, “Where {are} the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we can know them!”

\ts\*
\v 6 Then Lot went out to them at the entrance and shut the door behind him,
\v 7 and he said, “Please, my brothers, do not do evil!
\v 8 Behold, please: I have two daughters who have not known a man. Please let me bring them out to you, and you do to them as {is} good in your eyes. But do not do anything to these men, because for that {reason} they have come under the shadow of my rafters.”

\ts\*
\v 9 But they said, “Get back!” Then they said, “This one came to sojourn, and now he is judging {us}! We will treat you worse than them!” Then they pressed hard against the man Lot and came near to break down the door.

\ts\*
\v 10 But the men reached out their hand{s} and brought Lot into the house to them and shut the door.
\v 11 Then they struck the men who {were at} the entrance of the house with blindness, from the small and to the great, so that they became weary {trying} to find the door.

\ts\*
\p
\v 12 Then the men said to Lot, “Who else {belongs} to you here, a son-in-law or your sons or your daughters or anyone {else} who {belongs} to you in the city? Take {them} out from this place,
\v 13 because we are destroying this place. For their outcry before Yahweh {is} great, so Yahweh has sent us to destroy it.”

\ts\*
\v 14 Then Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law who were to take his daughters, and he said, “Get up, get out of this place, because Yahweh is destroying the city!” But it seemed like he was joking in the eyes of his sons-in-law.

\p
\v 15 Then when the dawn came, the angels urged Lot, saying, “Get up, take your wife and your two daughters who are here, so that you are not swept away in the punishment of the city.”

\ts\*
\v 16 But he lingered, so the men grabbed his hand and the hand of his wife and the hand{s} of his two daughters, because of Yahweh’s mercy for him, and brought him out and set him outside the city.
\v 17 And it happened when they had brought them out to the outside, then he said, “Flee for your life! Do not look behind you, and do not stop anywhere in the plain! Escape to the mountain{s} so that you are not swept away!”

\ts\*
\v 18 Then Lot said to them, “Please, no, my lords!
\v 19 Behold, please: Your servant has found favor in your eyes, and you have magnified your mercy that you have shown to me by saving my life. But I am not able to escape to the mountain{s}, because the disaster will overtake me and I will die.
\v 20 Behold, please: That town there {is} near to flee to, and it {is} a little one. Please let me escape there. Is it not a little one? Then my life will live.”

\ts\*
\v 21 Then he said to him, “Behold, I have also lifted up your face concerning this thing, so I will not overthrow the town that you are talking about.
\v 22 Hurry up, escape there, because I am not able to do a thing until you go there.” For that {reason} they called the name of the town Zoar.

\ts\*
\p
\v 23 The sun rose over the land and Lot came to Zoar.
\v 24 Then Yahweh rained down on Sodom and Gomorrah brimstone and fire from Yahweh out of the heavens,

\ts\*
\v 10 Then Abimelech said to Abraham, “What were you looking for when you did this thing?”

\v 3 Then Abraham got up from beside his dead one, and he spoke to the sons of Heth, saying,
\v 4 “I {am} a foreigner and a sojourner among you. Give to me property for a burial place among you, so that I can bury my dead from before me.”

\ts\*
\v 5 Then the sons of Heth replied to Abraham, saying to him,
\v 6 “Listen to us, my lord. You {are} a mighty prince among us. Bury your dead in the choicest of our burial places. Each of us will not withhold from you his burial place to bury your dead.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 7 Then Abraham got up and bowed to the people of the land, to the sons of Heth,
\v 8 and he said to them, saying, “If it is your will to bury my dead from before me, listen to me and intercede for me with Ephron, the son of Zohar,
\v 9 so that he will give to me the cave of Machpelah, which {belongs} to him, which {is} at the end of his field. For full price let him give it to me among you as property for a burial place.”

\v 10 Now Ephron was sitting among the sons of Heth, so Ephron the Hittite responded to Abraham in the ears of the sons of Heth, for everyone who had come {to} the gate of his city, saying,
\v 11 “No, my lord. Listen to me: I give to you the field, and I give to you the cave that {is} in it. I give it to you before the eyes of the sons of my people. Bury your dead.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 12 Then Abraham bowed before the people of the land,

\v 14 Then Ephron answered Abraham, saying to him,
\v 15 “My lord, listen to me. Land {worth} 400 shekels of silver, between me and you, what {is} that? So bury your dead.”
\v 16 So Abraham listened to Ephron, and Abraham weighed out to Ephron the price that he had mentioned in the ears of the sons of Heth, 400 shekels of silver, the currency among the merchants.

\v 17 So the field of Ephron that {was} in Machpelah which {was} before Mamre, the field and the cave that {was} in it, and every tree that {was} in the field, that {was} within all of its surrounding borders, was deeded

\v 4 but you will go to my country and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son, for Isaac.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 5 Then the servant said to him, “Suppose the woman is not willing to come with me to this land? Should I take your son back to the country that you came from?”
\v 6 Then Abraham said to him, “Be sure that you do not take my son back there.
\v 7 Yahweh, the God of the heavens, who took me from the house of my father and from the land of my relatives and who spoke to me and who swore to me, saying, ‘To your offspring I will give this land,’ he will send his angel before you, and you will take a wife for my son from there.

\ts\*
\v 8 But if the woman is not willing to come with you, then you are clear from this oath of mine. Only do not take my son back there!”

\v 9 Then the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master and swore to him concerning this matter.

\ts\*
\v 10 Then the servant took ten camels from the camels of his master and left, and all {kinds of} good {things} from his master {were} in his hand, and he got up and went to Aram Naharaim, to the city of Nahor.
\v 11 Then he made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at evening time, at the time the women who draw water come out.

\ts\*
\p
\v 12 Then he said, “Yahweh, God of my master Abraham, please cause it to happen before me today that you show kindness toward my master Abraham.
\v 13 Behold, I am standing by this spring of water, and the daughters of the people of the city are coming out to draw water.
\v 14 And let it be {that} the young woman whom I say to her, ‘Please let down your jar so that I may drink,’ and she says, ‘Drink and I will also water your camels,’ {let} her {be the one} you have appointed for your servant, for Isaac. And by her I will know that you have shown kindness toward my master.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 15 And it happened before he had finished speaking, then behold, Rebekah was coming out, who was born to Bethuel, the son of Milcah, the wife of Nahor, the brother of Abraham. And her water jar {was} on her shoulder.
\v 16 And the young woman {was} a very beautiful-looking virgin, and a man had not known her. And she went down to the spring and filled her jar and came up.

\ts\*
\p
\v 17 Then the servant ran to meet her and said, “Please let me drink a little water from your jar.”
\v 18 And she said, “Drink, my lord.” Then she hurried and lowered her jar to her hand{s} and gave him a drink.

\ts\*
\v 19 And {after} she finished giving him a drink, then she said, “I will also draw water for your camels until they have finished drinking.”
\v 20 Then she hurried and emptied her jar into the trough and ran back to the well to draw water, and she drew water for all his camels.

\ts\*
\v 21 And the man watched her silently to know whether Yahweh had made his journey succeed or not.

\p
\v 22 Then it happened, when the camels had finished drinking, then the man took out a gold nose ring, its weight a beka, and two gold bracelets for her arms, their weight ten shekels.
\v 23 And he said, “Whose daughter {are} you? Please tell me. Is there a place at the house of your father for us to lodge?”

\ts\*
\v 24 Then she said to him, “I {am} the daughter of Bethuel, the son of Milcah, whom she bore for Nahor.”
\v 25 Then she said to him, “Plenty of both straw and fodder {are} with us. {There is} also a place to lodge.”

\ts\*
\v 26 Then the man bowed down and prostrated himself before Yahweh,
\v 27 and said, “Praised be Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, who has not abandoned his kindness and his faithfulness toward my master. {As for} me, Yahweh has led me on the road {to} the home of the relatives of my master!”
\ts\*
\p
\v 28 Then the young woman ran and announced to the household of her mother about those things.
\v 29 Now Rebekah had a brother, and his name {was} Laban, and Laban ran to the man outside at the spring.
\v 30 And it was when he had seen the nose ring and the bracelets on the arms of his sister, and when he had heard the words of Rebekah his sister, saying, “This {is} what the man said to me,” then he went to the man, and behold, he was standing by the camels at the spring.

\ts\*
\v 31 Then he said, “Come, blessed of Yahweh. Why are you standing out here? For I have prepared the house and a place for the camels.”

\p
\v 32 So the man went to the house. Then he unloaded the camels and gave straw and fodder to the camels, and water to wash his feet and the feet of the men who {were} with him.

\ts\*
\v 33 Then food was set before him to eat, but he said, “I will not eat until I have spoken my words.” So he said, “Speak.”

\v 34 Then he said, “I {am} a servant of Abraham.
\v 35 And Yahweh has greatly blessed my master, so that he has become great. And he has given him flock{s} and herd{s}, and silver and gold, and men slaves and women slaves, and camels and donkeys.

\v 36 And Sarah, the wife of my master, bore a son for my master after her old age, and he has given to him everything that {belongs} to him.

\ts\*
\v 39 Then I said to my master, ‘Suppose the woman will not come with me?’

\v 42 “Then today I came to the spring, and I said, ‘Yahweh, God of my master Abraham, if it is your will, please make my journey succeed that I have come on.
\v 43 Behold, I am standing by {this} spring of water. And let it be {that} the young woman who comes out to draw {water} and I say to her, “Please give me a little water to drink from your jar,”
\v 44 and she says to me, “Both you drink and I will also draw water for your camels,” {let} her {be} the wife whom Yahweh has chosen for the son of my master.’

\ts\*
\p
\v 45 “Before I had finished speaking in my heart, then behold, Rebekah was coming out and her jar {was} on her shoulder. And she went down to the spring and drew water, and I said to her, ‘Please give me a drink.’

\ts\*
\v 47 Then I asked her and said, ‘Whose daughter {are} you?’ And she said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel, a son of Nahor whom Milcah bore for him.’ Then I put the ring on her nose and the bracelets on her arms.
\v 48 And I bowed down and prostrated myself before Yahweh, and I praised Yahweh, the God of my master Abraham, who led me on the right way to take the daughter of my master’s brother for his son.

\ts\*
\v 49 And now if it is your will to show kindness and faithfulness to my master, tell me. But if not, tell me, so that I will turn to the right or to the left.”

\p
\v 50 Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, “The thing has come from Yahweh; we are not able to tell you bad or good.
\v 51 Behold, Rebekah {is} before you. Take her and go, and let her be the wife of the son of your master, as Yahweh has spoken.”

\ts\*
\v 52 Then it happened, when the servant of Abraham heard their words, that he bowed down to the ground before Yahweh.
\v 53 Then the servant brought out jewelry of silver and jewelry of gold, and clothing, and gave them to Rebekah. And he gave valuable things to her brother and to her mother.

\ts\*
\p
\v 54 Then he and the men who {were} with him ate and drank and lodged. Then in the morning they got up, and he said, “Send me to my master.”
\v 55 But her brother and her mother said, “Let the young woman stay with us a few days, at least ten. After that she will go.”

\ts\*
\v 56 But he said to them, “Do not detain me, since Yahweh has made my journey succeed. Send me off so that I will go to my master.”
\v 57 Then they said, “Let’s call for the young woman and ask her mouth.”

\v 58 So they called for Rebekah and said to her, “Will you go with this man?” And she said, “I will go.”

\v 59 Then they sent off Rebekah their sister and her nurse and the servant of Abraham and his men.

\v 10 Then you take it to your father, and he will eat {it}, so that he will bless you before his death.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 11 Then Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, “Behold, Esau my brother {is} a hairy man, but I {am} a smooth man.
\v 12 Suppose my father touches me? Then I will be in his eyes as a deceiver, and I will bring a curse on me and not a blessing.”

\ts\*
\v 13 But his mother said to him, “Let your curse be on me, my son. Just listen to my voice, and go get {them} for me.”
\v 14 So he went and got {them} and brought {them} to his mother. Then his mother prepared tasty food such as his father loved.

\ts\*
\v 15 Then Rebekah took the best clothes of Esau her older son that {were} with her in the house and put them on Jacob her younger son.
\v 16 And she put the skins of the kid goats over his hands and over the smooth part of his neck.

\p
\v 17 Then she gave the tasty food and the bread that she had made into the hand{s} of Jacob her son,

\ts\*
\v 18 and he went to his father and said, “My father.” And he said, “Behold me. Who {are} you, my son?”
\v 19 Then Jacob said to his father, “I {am} Esau, your firstborn. I have done as you told me. Please get up, sit and eat some of my game, so that your soul will bless me.”

\ts\*
\v 20 Then Isaac said to his son, “How {is} this you were quick to find {it}, my son?” And he said, “Because Yahweh your God caused {it} to happen before me.”

\p
\v 21 Then Isaac said to Jacob, “Please come close, so that I can touch you, my son, {and know} whether you are really my son Esau or not.”

\ts\*
\v 22 So Jacob went close to Isaac his father, and he touched him and said, “The voice {is} the voice of Jacob, but the hands {are} the hands of Esau.”
\v 23 So he did not recognize him, because his hands were hairy like the hands of Esau his brother, and he was about to bless him.

\ts\*
\v 24 But he said, “{Are} you really my son Esau?” And he said, “I {am}.”
\v 25 Then he said, “Bring {the food} to me, and I will eat some of my son’s game, so that my soul will bless you.” Then he brought {it} to him, and he ate; and he brought wine to him, and he drank.

\ts\*
\p
\v 26 Then Isaac his father said to him, “Please come close and kiss me, my son.”
\v 27 So he went close and kissed him. And he smelled the smell of his clothes, so he blessed him and said,
\q1
“See, the smell of my son
\q2
{is} like the smell of a field
\q2
that Yahweh has blessed!
\ts\*
\q1 \v 28 And may God give to you from the dew of the heavens

\s1 Esau Gets “Blessed” Too by Isaac
\sr 27:30-40
\p
\v 30 Then it happened, just as Isaac finished blessing Jacob, and it happened, scarcely had Jacob just left from the presence of Isaac his father, then Esau his brother came in from his hunt.
\v 31 Then he too prepared tasty food, and he brought {it} to his father and said to his father, “Let my father get up and eat from his son’s game so that your soul can bless me.”

\ts\*
\v 32 But Isaac his father said to him, “Who {are} you?” And he said, “I {am} your son, your firstborn Esau.”
\v 33 Then Isaac trembled a very great tremble, and he said, “Then who {was} it that hunted game and brought {it} to me? And I ate from {it} all just before you came, and I blessed him. Indeed, he will be blessed.”

\ts\*
\v 34 When Esau heard the words of his father, then he cried out a great and exceedingly bitter cry and said to his father, “Bless me, me too, my father!”
\v 35 And he said, “Your brother came in deceit and took your blessing.”

\ts\*
\v 36 Then he said, “Is it because his name is called Jacob that he has defrauded me these two times? He took my birthright, and behold, now he has taken my blessing!”

\p
Then he said, “Have you not reserved a blessing for me?”
\v 37 But Isaac responded and said to Esau, “Behold, I have made him master over you, and I have given all his brothers to him as servants. And I have sustained him with grain and wine. So then, what can I do for you, my son?”

\ts\*
\v 38 But Esau said to his father, “Is there one blessing that you have, my father? Bless me, me too, my father!” Then Esau lifted his voice and sobbed.

\ts\*
\v 39 Then Isaac his father responded and said to him,
\q1
“Behold, your dwelling will be
\q2
away from the fatness of the earth
\q2
and away from the dew of the heavens from above.
\q1 \v 40 And you will live by your sword,

and you will serve your brother.

But it will happen when you become restless,

then you will break his yoke

\s1 Jacob Flees from Esau
\sr 27:41-28:5
\p
\v 41 Then Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing that his father had blessed him with, and Esau said in his heart, “The days of the mourning of my father are near; then I will kill Jacob my brother.”
\v 42 But the words of Esau her older son were told to Rebekah, so she sent and called for Jacob her younger son and said to him, “Behold, Esau your brother is consoling himself about you, planning to kill you.

\ts\*
\v 43 So now, my son, listen to my voice and get up, flee for yourself to Laban my brother in Haran!
\v 44 And stay with him for a few days until the fury of your brother turns away,
\v 45 until the anger of your brother turns away from you and he forgets what you have done to him. Then I will send and get you from there. Why should I also lose both of you {in} one day?”

\ts\*
\p
\v 46 Then Rebekah said to Isaac, “I am disgusted with my life because of the daughters of Heth! If Jacob takes a wife from the daughters of Heth like these, from daughters of the land, what {would} life {be} to me?”

\ts\*

\c 28
\p
\v 1 Then Isaac called for Jacob and blessed him, and commanded him and said to him, “Do not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan.
\v 2 Get up, go to Paddan Aram, to the home of Bethuel the father of your mother, and take a wife for yourself from there, from the daughters of Laban the brother of your mother.

\ts\*
\v 3 And may God Almighty bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you so that you become a community of peoples.
\v 4 And may he give the blessing of Abraham to you, to you and to your offspring with you, so that you possess the land of your sojournings, which God gave to Abraham.”

\s1 Esau Takes Another Wife
\sr 28:6-9
\p
\v 6 Now Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob and had sent him to Paddan Aram to take a wife for himself from there, {and that} when he blessed him, then he commanded him, saying, “Do not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan,”
\v 7 and {that} Jacob listened to his father and to his mother and went to Paddan Aram.

\ts\*
\v 8 Then Esau saw that the daughters of Canaan were displeasing in the eyes of Isaac his father.
\v 9 So Esau went to Ishmael and he took as a wife Mahalath, the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, the sister of Nebaioth, in addition to his wives {who belonged} to him.

\s1 Jacob’s Dream at Bethel
\sr 28:10-22
\p
\v 10 And Jacob left from Beersheba and set out for Haran.
\v 11 Then he reached a {certain} place, and he stopped there because the sun had gone. And he took {one} of the stones of the place and put it under his head, and he lay down in that place.

\ts\*
\v 12 And he dreamed, and behold, a stairway was set up on the earth and its top reached to the heavens, and behold, angels of God were ascending and descending on it.
\v 13 And behold, Yahweh was standing above it, and he said, “I {am} Yahweh, the God of Abraham your grandfather and the God of Isaac. The land that you are lying on I will give to you and to your offspring.

\ts\*
\v 14 And your offspring will be like the dust of the earth, and you will spread out to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south. And in you and in your offspring all the families of the earth will be blessed.
\v 15 And behold, I {am} with you, and I will watch over you in every {place} that you go, and I will bring you back to this land. For I will not leave you until I have done what I have spoken to you.”

\ts\*
\v 16 Then Jacob woke up from his sleep and said, “Surely Yahweh is in this place, but I did not know {it}!”
\v 17 So he was afraid and said, “How awesome this place is! This is nothing other than the house of God, and this {is} the gateway of heaven!”

\ts\*
\p
\v 18 Then in the morning Jacob got up early, and he took the stone that he had put under his head and stood it up {as} a pillar, and he poured oil on its top.
\v 19 And he called the name of that place Bethel, even though Luz {had been} the name of the town at first.

\ts\*
\p
\v 20 Then Jacob vowed a vow, saying, “If God will be with me and watch over me on this road that I am walking on and give to me bread to eat and clothes to wear,
\v 21 and {if} I return in peace to the home of my father, then Yahweh will be God to me,

\s1 Jacob Meets Rachel and Laban in Haran
\sr 29:1-14
\p
\v 1 Then Jacob lifted his feet and went to the land of the sons of the east.
\v 2 And he looked, and behold, a well {was} in the field, and behold, three flocks of sheep were lying there near it, because from that well the flocks were watered, and the stone over the mouth of the well {was} large.
\v 3 And all the flocks would be gathered there, then they would roll the stone from over the mouth of the well and water the sheep. Then they would return the stone to its place over the mouth of the well.

\ts\*
\p
\v 4 Then Jacob said to them, “My brothers, where {are} you from?” And they said, “We {are} from Haran.”
\v 5 Then he said to them, “Do you know Laban, the grandson of Nahor?” And they said, “We know him.”
\v 6 Then he said to them, “Are {things} well for him?” And they said, “{Things are} well. And behold, Rachel his daughter is coming with the sheep.”

\ts\*
\v 7 Then he said, “Behold, the day {is} still large. {It is} not time for the livestock to be gathered. Water the sheep, and go pasture {them}.”
\v 8 But they said, “We cannot, until all the flocks are gathered and they roll the stone from over the mouth of the well. Then we will water the sheep.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 9 He was still talking with them when Rachel came with the sheep that {belonged} to her father, because she was tending them.
\v 10 Then it happened, when Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of Laban his mother’s brother, and the sheep of Laban his mother’s brother, then Jacob went over and rolled the stone from over the mouth of the well, and watered the sheep of Laban his mother’s brother.

\ts\*
\v 11 Then Jacob kissed Rachel and lifted his voice and cried.
\v 12 Then Jacob told Rachel that he {was} a relative of her father and that he {was} a son of Rebekah. Then she ran and told her father.

\ts\*
\p
\v 13 And it happened, when Laban heard the news about Jacob the son of his sister, then he ran to meet him. Then he embraced him and kissed him and brought him to his house. Then he told Laban all these things,

\ts\*
\s1 Jacob Works for Laban to Marry Rachel and Leah
\sr 29:14b-30
\p
Then he stayed with him a month of days.
\v 15 Then Laban said to Jacob, “Because you {are} my relative, should you then serve me for nothing? Tell me, what {are} your wages?”
\v 16 Now Laban had two daughters. The name of the older {was} Leah, and the name of the younger {was} Rachel.
\v 17 And the eyes of Leah {were} delicate, but Rachel was lovely of form and beautiful of appearance.
\v 18 And Jacob loved Rachel, so he said, “I will serve you seven years for Rachel your younger daughter.”

\ts\*
\v 19 And Laban said, “{It is} better for me to give her to you than for me to give her to another man. Stay with me.”
\v 20 So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, but in his eyes they were like a few days because of his love for her.

\ts\*
\p
\v 21 Then Jacob said to Laban, “Give {me} my wife, because my days are completed, so that I may go to her.”
\v 22 Then Laban gathered all the people of the place and made a feast.

\ts\*
\v 23 But it happened in the evening that he took Leah his daughter and brought her to him, and he went to her.
\v 24 And Laban gave to her Zilpah his maidservant, to Leah his daughter, {to be} a maidservant.

\p
\v 25 Then it happened in the morning, that behold, she {was} Leah! So he said to Laban, “What {is} this you have done to me? Was {it} not for Rachel that I served with you? So why have you deceived me?”

\ts\*
\v 26 But Laban said, “It is not done so in our place to give the younger before the firstborn.
\v 27 Fulfill the week of this {one}, then we will also give you this {one} for service that you will serve with me for another seven years.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 28 So Jacob did so, and he fulfilled the week {for} that {one}. Then he gave to him Rachel his daughter as a wife for him.
\v 29 And Laban gave Bilhah his maidservant to Rachel his daughter as a maidservant for her.
\v 30 Then he also went to Rachel, and he also loved Rachel more than Leah. And he served him for another seven years.

\ts\*
\s1 Jacob’s Children
\sr 29:31-30:24
\p
\v 31 Now Yahweh saw that Leah was hated, so he opened her womb, but Rachel {was} barren.
\v 32 Then Leah conceived and bore a son, and she called his name Reuben, because she said, “Because Yahweh has looked on my misery, surely now my husband will love me.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 33 Then she conceived again and bore a son, and she said, “Because Yahweh heard that I am hated, then he gave to me this {son} also.” So she called his name Simeon.

\p
\v 34 Then she conceived again and bore a son, and she said, “This time now my husband will be joined to me, because I have born three sons for him.” For that {reason} he called his name Levi.

\ts\*
\p
\v 35 Then she conceived again and bore a son, and she said, “This time I will praise Yahweh.” For that {reason} she called his name Judah. Then she stopped bearing.

\ts\*

\c 30
\p
\v 1 Now Rachel saw that she was not bearing {children} for Jacob, so Rachel envied her sister, and she said to Jacob, “Give me children, and if not, I will die!”
\v 2 And Jacob’s anger burned against Rachel, and he said, “Am I in the place of God, who has kept the fruit of the womb from you?”

\ts\*
\v 3 Then she said, “Behold my slave woman Bilhah. Go to her so that she will bear {children} on my knees, and I also will be built up from her.”
\v 4 And she gave to him Bilhah her maidservant as a wife, and Jacob went to her.

\ts\*
\p
\v 5 Then Bilhah conceived and bore a son for Jacob,
\v 6 and Rachel said, “God has vindicated me, and indeed, he has listened to my voice and given to me a son!” For that {reason} she called his name Dan.

\ts\*
\p
\v 7 Then Bilhah the maidservant of Rachel conceived again and bore a second son for Jacob.
\v 8 So Rachel said, “{With} mighty wrestlings I have wrestled with my sister. Indeed I have prevailed!” And she called his name Naphtali.

\ts\*
\p
\v 9 Now Leah saw that she had ceased from bearing {children}, so she took Zilpah her maidservant and gave her to Jacob as a wife.
\v 10 Then Zilpah the maidservant of Leah bore a son for Jacob,
\v 11 and Leah said, “What good fortune!” So she called his name Gad.

\ts\*
\p
\v 12 Then Zilpah the maidservant of Leah bore a second son for Jacob,
\v 13 and Leah said, “How blessed I am! For women will call me blessed.” So she called his name Asher.

\ts\*
\p
\v 14 Then in the days of the wheat harvest, Reuben went out and found mandrakes in the field, and he brought them to Leah his mother. Then Rachel said to Leah, “Please give to me some of your son’s mandrakes.”
\v 15 But she said to her, “Is it a small matter you have taken my husband? And would you also take my son’s mandrakes?” Then Rachel said, “Therefore he may lie with you tonight for your son’s mandrakes.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 16 Then Jacob came from the field in the evening, and Leah went out to meet him and said, “You must come to me, because I have surely hired you with my son’s mandrakes.” So he lay with her during that night,
\v 17 and God listened to Leah, and she conceived and bore a fifth son for Jacob.
\v 18 Then Leah said, “God has given {me} my reward because I gave my maidservant to my husband.” So she called his name Issachar.

\ts\*
\p
\v 19 Then Leah conceived again and bore a sixth son for Jacob.
\v 20 And Leah said, “God has presented me a good present. This time my husband will honor me because I have born six sons for him.” So she called his name Zebulun.

\p
\v 21 Then later she bore a daughter and called her name Dinah.

\ts\*
\p
\v 22 Then God remembered Rachel, and God listened to her and opened her womb.
\v 23 Then she conceived and bore a son, and she said, “God has taken away my disgrace!”

\s1 Jacob Becomes Very Rich Working for Laban

\v 26 Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, so that I may go. For you yourself know my service that I have served you.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 27 Then Laban said to him, “Please {stay}, if I have found favor in your eyes. I have learned by divination that Yahweh has blessed me because of you.”
\v 28 Then he said, “Name your wages to me, and I will give {them}.”

\ts\*
\v 29 And he said to him, “You yourself know how I have served you and how your livestock have been with me.
\v 30 For {there was} little that was yours before me, and it has prospered to abundance, and Yahweh has blessed you at my feet. But now, when will I also do something for my household?”

\ts\*
\p
\v 31 Then he said, “What should I give to you?” And Jacob said, “Do not give anything to me. If you will do this thing for me, I will continue tending your flock{s} watching over {them}:
\v 32 I will pass through all your flock{s} today to remove from there every speckled and spotted lamb and every dark-colored lamb among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled {young} among the goats. And that will be my wages.

\ts\*
\v 33 So my righteousness will testify for me in future days when you go over my wages in front of you: any that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and dark-colored among the sheep, it was stolen {if it is} with me.”

\p
\v 34 And Laban said, “Behold, let it be according to your word.”

\ts\*
\v 35 Then on that day he removed the male goats that were streaked and spotted, and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, any that {had} white on it, and all the dark-colored {ones} among the lambs. Then he gave {them} into the hand of his sons,
\v 36 and he put a three-day journey between himself and Jacob. And Jacob was tending the rest of Laban’s flock{s}.

\ts\*
\p
\v 37 Then Jacob took for himself fresh-cut branches of poplar and almond and plane trees, and peeled white stripes in them, exposing the white that {was} inside the branches.
\v 38 Then he put the branches that he had peeled in the troughs, in the water troughs where the flock{s} came to drink, in front of the flock{s}. And they were in heat when they came to drink,

\ts\*
\v 39 and the flock{s} would mate by the branches, and the flock{s} would bear streaked, speckled, and spotted {young}.
\v 40 Then Jacob set apart the lambs, and he made the faces of the flock{s} look at the streaked and all the dark-colored {animals} in the flock{s} of Laban. And he put flocks for himself by themselves, and he did not put them with the flock{s} of Laban.

\ts\*
\p
\v 41 So it happened whenever the strong animals were in heat, then Jacob put the branches in the troughs before the eyes of the flocks so that they would mate by the branches.
\v 42 But when the animals were weak, he did not put {them} {in}. So it was the weak {ones} {went} to Laban, and the strong {ones} to Jacob,

\v 1 Then he heard the words of the sons of Laban, {who} were saying, “Jacob has taken everything that {belonged} to our father, and from what {belonged} to our father he has gained all this wealth!”
\v 2 And Jacob saw the face of Laban, and behold, he was not with him as yesterday {and} three days ago.
\v 3 Then Yahweh said to Jacob, “Go back to the land of your fathers and to your relatives, and I will be with you.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 4 Then Jacob sent and called for Rachel and Leah to the field to his flock{s}.
\v 5 Then he said to them, “I have seen the face of your father, that he is not toward me as yesterday {and} three days ago, but the God of my father has been with me.
\v 6 And you know that with all my might I have served your father,

\ts\*
\v 7 but your father has deceived me and changed my wages ten times. However, God has not allowed him to harm me.
\v 8 If he said like this: ‘The speckled {animals} will be your wages,’ then all the flock{s} bore speckled {young}. But if he said like this: ‘The streaked {ones} will be your wages,’ then all the flock{s} bore streaked {young}.
\v 9 So God took away the livestock of your father and gave {them} to me.

\ts\*
\p
\v 10 “And it happened in the season the flock{s} were in heat, and I lifted my eyes and saw in a dream that, behold, the he-goats that were mounting the flock{s} {were} streaked, speckled, and spotted.
\v 11 Then an angel of God said to me in the dream, ‘Jacob!’ and I said, ‘Behold me.’

\ts\*
\v 12 Then he said, ‘Please lift up your eyes and see all the he-goats that are mounting the flock{s} {are} streaked, speckled, and spotted, because I have seen all that Laban is doing to you.
\v 13 I {am} the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar, where you vowed a vow to me. Now get up, go out from this land, and return to the land of your birth.’”

\ts\*
\p
\v 14 Then Rachel replied, and Leah, and they said to him, “Is there still for us a portion or inheritance in the house of our father?
\v 15 Are we not regarded by him {as} foreigners? For he sold us, and he has indeed completely eaten up our silver.
\v 16 For all the wealth that God took from our father {belongs} to us and to our children. So now, do all that God has said to you.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 17 So Jacob got up and put his sons and his wives on the camels.
\v 18 Then he drove all his livestock and all his property that he had acquired, the livestock in his possession that he had acquired in Paddan Aram, to go to Isaac his father, to the land of Canaan.

\ts\*
\p
\v 19 Now Laban had gone to shear his sheep, so Rachel stole the idols that {belonged} to her father,
\v 20 and Jacob stole the heart of Laban the Aramean by not informing him that he was fleeing.

\ts\*
\v 26 Then Laban said to Jacob, “What have you done? And you have stolen my heart and carried away my daughters like captives of the sword!
\v 27 Why did you secretly flee and deceive me and not tell me? For I would have sent you with joy and with songs, with tambourine{s} and with lyre{s}!
\v 28 And you did not let me kiss my grandchildren and my daughters! Now you have acted foolishly by doing {that}!

\ts\*
\v 29 It is in the power of my hand to do harm to you, but last night the God of your father said to me, saying, ‘Keep yourself from speaking with Jacob either good or bad.’
\v 30 So now, you have surely gone because you greatly long for the house of your father. Why did you steal my gods?”

\ts\*
\p
\v 31 Then Jacob answered and said to Laban, “Because I was afraid, because I said that perhaps you would seize your daughters from me.
\v 32 Whomever you find your gods with will not live! In front of our relatives, observe for yourself what {is} with me, and take {what belongs} to you.” Now Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen them.

\ts\*
\p
\v 33 Then Laban went into the tent of Jacob and into the tent of Leah and into the tent of the two slave women, but he did not find {anything}. Then he came out of Leah’s tent and went into Rachel’s tent.

\v 34 Now Rachel had taken the idols and put them inside the camel’s saddle and was sitting on them. And Laban felt throughout the entire tent, but he did not find {them}.

\v 36 Then it burned within Jacob, and he disputed with Laban, and Jacob responded and said to Laban, “What {is} my crime? What {is} my sin, that you have hotly pursued after me?

\v 39 I did not bring torn {animals} to you; I bore the loss of it myself. You required it from my hand, {those} stolen by day and {those} stolen by night.
\v 40 There I was: In the day, heat devoured me, and in the night the frost, so that my sleep fled from my eyes.

\ts\*
\v 41 That {is how it was} for me twenty years in your house. I served you fourteen years for your two daughters, and six years for your flock{s}, and you changed my wages ten times.
\v 42 If the God of my father, the God of Abraham and the Fear of Isaac, had not been with me, surely now you would have sent me away empty-handed. God has seen my affliction and the toil of my palms, and he judged {you} last night.”

\s1 Jacob and Laban Cut a Covenant
\sr 31:43-55

\v 43 And Laban responded and said to Jacob, “The daughters {are} my daughters, and the children {are} my grandchildren, and the flock{s} {are} my flock{s}. And everything that you see {belongs} to me! But what can I do today about these daughters of mine or about their children whom they have born?
\v 44 So now, come, let us cut a covenant, I and you, and let it be a witness between me and you.”

\ts\*
\v 45 So Jacob took a stone and set it up {as} a pillar.
\v 46 Then Jacob said to his relatives, “Gather stones.” So they took stones and made a heap. Then they ate there by the heap.
\v 47 And Laban called it Jegar Sahadutha, but Jacob called it Galeed.

\ts\*
\v 48 And Laban said, “This heap {is} a witness between me and you today.” For that {reason} he called its name Galeed.
\v 49 {It is} also Mizpah, because he said, “May Yahweh watch between me and you when we are hidden one from the other.
\v 50 If you afflict my daughters, or if you take wives besides my daughters, {even though} there is not someone with us, behold, God {is} a witness between me and you.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 51 Then Laban said to Jacob, “Behold this heap, and behold the pillar which I set up between me and you.
\v 52 This heap {is} a witness and the pillar {is} a witness that I will not pass by this heap to you, and that you will not pass by this heap and this pillar to me, to do harm.
\v 53 May the God of Abraham and the gods of Nahor, the gods of their father, judge between us!” Then Jacob swore by the Fear of his father Isaac,

\ts\*
\v 54 and Jacob sacrificed a sacrifice on the mountain. Then he called his relatives to eat bread. Then they ate bread and spent the night on the mountain.

\v 2 And when he saw them, Jacob said, “This {is} God’s camp!” So he called the name of that place Mahanaim.

\ts\*
\p
\v 3 Then Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother to the land of Seir, the country of Edom.
\v 4 And he commanded them, saying, “This {is what} you will say to my lord, to Esau: ‘This {is what} your servant Jacob says, “I have been sojourning with Laban and have remained there until now.
\v 5 And I have cattle and donkey{s}, flock{s}, and menservant{s} and maidservant{s}. And I have sent {messengers} to speak with my lord, so that I will find favor in your eyes.”’”

\ts\*
\p
\v 6 Then the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, “We went to your brother, to Esau. And also, he is coming to meet you, and 400 men with him!”
\v 7 And Jacob was exceedingly afraid, and it was distressing for him, so he divided the people who {were} with him and the flock{s} and the herd{s} and the camels into two camps.
\v 8 And he said, “If Esau comes to one camp and strikes them, then the camp that is left will escape.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 9 Then Jacob said, “God of my grandfather Abraham, and God of my father Isaac, Yahweh, who said to me, ‘Return to your land and to your relatives, and I will cause things to prosper with you,’
\v 10 I am unworthy of all the kindnesses and of all the faithfulness that you have shown your servant. For I crossed this Jordan with my staff, but now I have become two camps.

\ts\*
\v 11 Please save me from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau, because I am afraid of him, that he will come and strike me {and} the mothers with the children!
\v 12 But you said, ‘I will surely cause things to prosper with you, and I will make your descendants as the sand of the sea, which cannot be counted from {their} abundance.’”

\ts\*
\p
\v 13 Then he stayed there for that night, and he took gifts from what was in his hand for Esau his brother:
\v 14 two hundred she-goats and twenty he-goats, two hundred ewes and twenty rams,
\v 15 thirty nursing camels and their young, forty cows and ten bulls, twenty female donkeys and ten male donkeys.
\v 16 And he gave them into the hand{s} of his servants, each herd by itself. And he said to his servants, “Go before me, and put space between each herd.”

\ts\*
\v 17 And he commanded the first {one}, saying, “When Esau my brother meets you and asks you, saying, ‘Whom do you {belong} to, and where are you going? And whom do these {animals} {belong} to {that are} before you?’
\v 18 then you say, ‘{They belong} to your servant, to Jacob. They {are} a gift sent to my lord, to Esau. And behold, he {is} also behind us.’”

\ts\*
\p
\v 19 Then he also commanded the second {servant}, also the third, also all who followed behind the herds, saying, “Say the same thing to Esau when you find him.
\v 20 And also say, ‘Behold, your servant Jacob {is} behind us.’” For he said, “I will cover his face with the gift that is going before me, and after that, when I see his face, perhaps he will receive my face.”
\v 21 Then the gift went before him, and he himself stayed for that night in the camp.

\s1 Jacob Wrestles with God, Who Names Him Israel

\v 22 Then during that night he got up and took his two wives and his two maidservants and his eleven sons and crossed over the ford of the Jabbok.
\v 23 So he took them and had them cross over the stream, and he sent what {belonged} to him across.

\ts\*
\v 24 Then Jacob was left alone, and a man wrestled with him until the dawn came up.
\v 25 And he saw that he was not prevailing over him, so he touched {him} on the socket of his hip, so that the socket of Jacob’s hip was dislocated as he wrestled with him.
\v 26 Then he said, “Release me, because the dawn has come up!” But he said, “I will not release you unless you bless me!”

\ts\*
\v 27 So he said to him, “What {is} your name?” And he said, “Jacob.”
\v 28 Then he said, “Your name will not be called Jacob anymore, but Israel, because you have struggled with God and with men, and you have prevailed.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 29 Then Jacob asked and said, “Please tell {me} your name.” But he said, “Why {is} this you are asking for my name?” Then he blessed him there.
\v 30 So Jacob called the name of the place Peniel, because {he said}, “I saw God face to face, but my life was preserved!”

\ts\*
\p
\v 31 And the sun rose on him as he passed Penuel, and he was limping because of his hip.

\v 1 Then Jacob lifted his eyes and looked, and behold, Esau was coming, and with him 400 men. Then he divided the children among Leah and Rachel and the two maidservants.
\v 2 And he put the maidservants and their children first, and Leah and her children after them, and Rachel and Joseph after them.
\v 3 Then he himself went before them, and he bowed to the ground seven times as he came near to his brother.

\ts\*
\p
\v 4 But Esau ran to meet him and embraced him, and he fell on his neck and kissed him, and they cried.
\v 5 Then he lifted his eyes and saw the women and the children, and he said, “Who {are} these with you?” And he said, “The children whom God has graciously given to your servant.”

\ts\*
\v 6 Then the maidservants came near, they and their children, and they bowed down.
\v 7 Then Leah also came near and her children, and they bowed down. Then after {that}, Joseph came near and Rachel, and they bowed down.

\v 8 Then he said, “What to you {are} all these groups that I met?” And he said, “To find favor in the eyes of my lord.”

\ts\*
\v 9 Then Esau said, “I have plenty, my brother. Let what {belongs} to you be yours.”
\v 10 But Jacob said, “No, please. If, please, I have found favor in your eyes, then take my gift from my hand. For indeed I have seen your face, {which is} like seeing the face of God, and you have received me.
\v 11 Please take my blessing that was brought to you, because God has been gracious to me, and because I have everything.” And he urged him, so he took {it}.

\ts\*
\p
\v 12 Then he said, “Let’s travel and go, and I will go in front of you.”
\v 13 But he said to him, “My lord knows that the children {are} tender and the flock{s} and the herd{s} {that} are nursing {are} with me. And if they drive them one day, then all the flock{s} will die.
\v 14 Please let my lord go on before his servant, and I will lead them on at my gentle pace, at the pace of the livestock that {are} ahead of me and at the pace of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir.”

\v 15 And Esau said, “Please let me leave with you some of the people who {are} with me.” But he said, “Why {do} that? Let me find favor in the eyes of my lord.”
\v 16 So on that day Esau went on his way back to Seir.
\v 17 And Jacob traveled to Succoth, and he built a house for himself, and for his livestock he made shelters. For that {reason} he called the name of the place Succoth.

\ts\*
\v 18 Then Jacob came {in} peace {to} the city of Shechem, which {was} in the land of Canaan, when he came from Paddan Aram, and he camped before the city.
\v 19 And he bought the portion of the field where he pitched his tent{s} from the hand{s} of the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem, for a hundred kesitahs.

\v 1 Then Dinah, the daughter of Leah, whom she had born for Jacob, went out to see the daughters of the land.
\v 2 And Shechem, the son of Hamor the Hivite, the ruler of the land, saw her, and he took her and lay with her and violated her.
\v 3 And his soul was attached to Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he loved the young woman and spoke to the heart of the young woman.

\ts\*
\v 4 Then Shechem said to Hamor his father, saying, “Get this girl for me as a wife.”

\p
\v 5 Then Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter, and his sons were with his livestock in the fields, so Jacob kept quiet until they came.

\ts\*
\v 6 And Hamor the father of Shechem came out to Jacob to talk with him.
\v 7 Then the sons of Jacob came from the fields. When they heard, then the men were grieved and it burned within them greatly, because he had done something disgraceful to Israel by lying with the daughter of Jacob, and such a thing should not have been done!

\ts\*
\v 8 But Hamor spoke with them, saying, “Shechem my son, his soul is attached to your daughter. Please give her to him as a wife.
\v 9 And intermarry with us: Give your daughters to us, and take our daughters for yourselves,
\v 10 and settle with us. And the land is before you. Settle and trade in it, and acquire {property} in it.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 11 Then Shechem said to her father and to her brothers, “Let me find favor in your eyes, and what you say to me I will give.
\v 12 Increase greatly the dowry and gift for me, and I will give according to what you say to me. Then give the young woman to me as a wife.”

\p
\v 13 Then the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father with deceit when they spoke, because he had defiled Dinah their sister.

\ts\*
\v 14 And they said to them, “We are not able to do this thing, to give our sister to a man who has a foreskin, because that {is} a disgrace to us!
\v 15 Only on this {condition} will we consent with you: if you become like us by every male among you being circumcised.
\v 16 Then we will give our daughters to you, and we will take your daughters for us. And we will settle with you, and we will become one people.
\v 17 But if you will not listen to us to be circumcised, then we will take our daughter and go.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 18 And their words were good in the eyes of Hamor and in the eyes of Shechem, Hamor’s son.
\v 19 So the young man did not delay to do the thing, because he was delighted with the daughter of Jacob, and he was honored more than all of the house of his father.

\ts\*
\v 20 So Hamor and Shechem his son went to the gate of their city, and they spoke to the men of their city, saying,
\v 21 “These men {are} peaceful with us, so let them settle in the land, and let them trade in it. And behold, the land {is} broad of hands before them. We can take their daughters for ourselves as wives, and we can give our daughters to them.

\ts\*
\v 22 Only on this {condition} will the men consent with us to settle with us, to become one people: when every male among us is circumcised just as they are circumcised.
\v 23 Their livestock and their property and all their animals, will they not {belong} to us? Only let us consent with them, and they will settle with us!”

\ts\*
\p
\v 24 And all who went out of the gate of his city listened to Hamor and to Shechem his son, and every male was circumcised, all who went out of the gate of his city.

\p
\v 25 Then it happened on the third day, when they were in pain, then two of Jacob’s sons, Simeon and Levi, brothers of Dinah, each took his sword and went upon the city boldly and killed every male.
\v 26 And they killed Hamor and Shechem his son with the mouth of the sword, and they took Dinah from the house of Shechem and left.

\ts\*
\v 27 The sons of Jacob came upon the slain and plundered the city, because they had defiled their sister.
\v 28 They took their flock{s} and their herd{s} and their donkeys, and what {was} in the city and what {was} in the field{s}.
\v 29 And all their wealth and all their little ones and their women they took captive, and they also plundered everything that {was} in the houses.

\v 30 Then Jacob said to Simeon and to Levi, “You have brought trouble on me by making me stink among {those} who live in the land, among the Canaanites and among the Perizzites! And I am few of number, and if they gather together against me and attack me, then I will be destroyed, I and my house!”

\v 3 Then let us get up and go up to Bethel, and there I will make an altar to God, who answered me in the day of my distress. And he has been with me in the way that I have gone.”

\v 4 So they gave to Jacob all the foreign gods that {were} in their hand{s} and the rings that {were} in their ears, and Jacob hid them under the terebinth tree that {was} by Shechem.

\v 6 Then Jacob came to Luz, which {is} Bethel, which {is} in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who {were} with him.

\v 8 Then Deborah, the nurse of Rebekah, died and was buried below Bethel, under the oak tree. So he called its name Allon Bacuth.

\ts\*
\p
\v 9 Then God appeared to Jacob again when he had come from Paddan Aram, and he blessed him,

\v 11 And his brothers envied him, but his father kept the matter {in mind}.

\s1 Joseph’s Brothers Sell Him as a Slave
\sr 37:12-36

\v 12 Then his brothers went to shepherd the flock{s} of their father near Shechem.
\v 13 And Israel said to Joseph, “Aren’t your brothers shepherding near Shechem? Come and I will send you to them.” And he said to him, “Behold me.”
\v 14 Then he said to him, “Please go and see the well-being of your brothers and the well-being of the flock{s}, and bring me word.” So he sent him from the valley of Hebron, and he went to Shechem.

\ts\*
\v 15 And a man found him, and behold, he was wandering around in the fields. So the man asked him, saying, “What are you looking for?”
\v 16 And he said, “I am looking for my brothers. Please tell me where they are shepherding.”
\v 17 Then the man said, “They set out from here. For I heard them say, ‘Let us go to Dothan.’”

\ts\*
\p
 Then Joseph went after his brothers and found them at Dothan.
\v 18 But they saw him from a distance, and before he came near to them, then they conspired against him to kill him.
\v 19 And they said each to his brother, “Behold, that master of dreams is coming!
\v 20 So now, come and let us kill him and throw him into one of the cisterns. Then we will say an evil animal devoured him, and we will see what his dreams become!”

\ts\*
\p
\v 21 But Reuben heard, and he rescued him from their hand{s} and said, “Let us not strike his life.”
\v 22 And Reuben said to them, “Do not shed blood. Throw him into this cistern which {is} in the wilderness, but do not lay a hand on him,” in order to rescue him from their hand{s}, to return him to his father.

\ts\*
\p
\v 23 Then it happened when Joseph came to his brothers, then they stripped Joseph of his tunic, the multicolored tunic that {was} on him.
\v 24 Then they took him and threw him into the cistern. And the cistern {was} empty; there was not water in it.

\ts\*
\p
\v 25 Then they sat down to eat bread, and they lifted their eyes and looked, and behold, a caravan of Ishmaelites was coming from Gilead. And their camels were carrying spices and balm and myrrh {that} they were going to take down to Egypt.
\v 26 Then Judah said to his brothers, “What gain {is there} if we kill our brother and cover up his blood?

\ts\*
\v 27 Come and let us sell him to the Ishmaelites so that our hand{s} will not be on him. For he {is} our brother, our flesh.” And his brothers listened.
\v 28 Then the Midianite men, traders, passed by, and they drew Joseph up and lifted him out of the cistern and sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites for twenty {shekels of} silver. Then they brought Joseph to Egypt.

\ts\*
\p
\v 29 Then Reuben returned to the cistern, but behold, Joseph was not in the cistern, so he tore his clothes.
\v 30 Then he returned to his brothers and said, “The boy is not {there}! And I, where am I going?”

\ts\*
\v 31 Then they took Joseph’s tunic and slaughtered a kid of the goats and dipped the tunic in the blood.

\p
\v 32 Then they sent the multicolored tunic and had it brought to their father and said, “We found this. Please examine whether it {is} your son’s tunic or not.”
\v 33 And he examined it and said, “{It is} my son’s tunic! An evil animal has devoured him! Surely Joseph was torn to pieces!”

\ts\*
\v 34 Then Jacob tore his clothes and put sackcloth on his loins, and he mourned for his son many days.
\v 35 And all his sons and all his daughters got up to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted and said, “For I will go down to my son in Sheol mourning.” So his father wept for him.

\s1 Judah and Tamar
\sr 38:1-30
\p
\v 1 And it happened at that time that Judah went down from his brothers and settled near an Adullamite man, and his name {was} Hirah.
\v 2 And there Judah saw the daughter of a Canaanite man, and his name {was} Shua, and he took her. Then he went to her,

\ts\*
\v 3 and she conceived and bore a son, and he called his name Er.
\v 4 Then she conceived again and bore a son, and she called his name Onan.
\v 5 And she added yet and bore a son, and she called his name Shelah. And he was in Chezib when she bore him.

\ts\*
\p
\v 6 Then Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, and her name {was} Tamar.
\v 7 But Er, the firstborn of Judah, was evil in the eyes of Yahweh, so Yahweh killed him.

\ts\*
\p
\v 8 Then Judah said to Onan, “Go to the wife of your brother and perform your duty to her and produce offspring for your brother.”
\v 9 However, Onan knew that the offspring would not be his, so it happened when he went to the wife of his brother, then he spilled {it} on the ground so that he would not give offspring to his brother.
\v 10 And what he did was evil in the eyes of Yahweh, so he killed him also.

\ts\*
\p
\v 11 Then Judah said to Tamar his daughter-in-law, “Remain a widow in the house of your father until Shelah my son grows up.” For he said, “So that he does not also die like his brothers!” So Tamar went and lived in the house of her father.

\ts\*
\p
\v 12 Then the days were many, and Shua’s daughter, the wife of Judah, died. Then Judah was comforted, and he went up to Timnah, to {the men} who were shearing his sheep, he and his friend Hirah the Adullamite.
\v 13 And it was told to Tamar, saying, “Behold, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.”
\v 14 So she took off her widow’s clothes from her and covered herself with a veil and wrapped herself. Then she sat at the entrance of Enaim, which {is} on the road to Timnah, because she saw that Shelah had grown up, but she had not been given to him as a wife.

\ts\*
\p
\v 15 Then Judah saw her, and he thought she was a prostitute because she had covered her face.
\v 16 So he turned to her beside the road and said, “Please come, let me come to you,” because he did not know that she {was} his daughter-in-law. And she said, “What will you give to me if you will come to me?”

\ts\*
\v 17 And he said, “I will send a kid goat from the flock.” And she said, “If you will give a pledge until you send {it}.”
\v 18 Then he said, “What {is} the pledge that I should give to you?” And she said, “Your signet and your cord and your staff that {is} in your hand.” So he gave {them} to her and went to her, and she conceived by him.

\ts\*
\v 19 Then she got up and left, and she took off her veil from her and put on her widow’s clothes.

\p
\v 20 Then Judah sent the kid goat by the hand of his friend the Adullamite to get back the pledge from the hand of the woman, but he did not find her.

\ts\*
\v 21 So he asked the men of her place, saying, “Where {is} the temple prostitute who {was} at Enaim beside the road?” But they said, “There has not been a temple prostitute in this place.”
\v 22 So he returned to Judah and said, “I did not find her. And also, the men of the place said, ‘There has not been a temple prostitute in this {place}.’”
\v 23 And Judah said, “Let her take {the things} for herself so that we do not become a laughingstock. Behold, I sent this kid, but you did not find her.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 24 And it happened about three months later that it was told to Judah, saying, “Tamar your daughter-in-law has prostituted herself, and also, behold, {she is} pregnant by her prostitutions!” So Judah said, “Bring her out, and let her be burned!”
\v 25 She was being brought out, and she sent {a message} to her father-in-law, saying, “By the man whom these things belong to, I {am} pregnant.” Then she said, “Please identify whose signet and cords and staff these {are}.”
\v 26 And Judah identified {the things} and said, “She is more righteous than I {am}, because I did not give her to Shelah my son!” And he did not continue to know her more.

\ts\*
\p
\v 27 Then it happened when {it was} time for her to give birth, then behold, twins {were} inside her womb!
\v 28 And it happened, as she was giving birth, then {one} put out a hand, and the midwife took a scarlet thread and tied {it} on his hand, saying, “This {one} came out first.”

\ts\*
\v 29 But it happened, when he drew his hand back in, then behold, his brother came out. Then she said, “How have you breached for yourself a breach?” So he called his name Perez.

\s1 Joseph and Potiphar’s Wife
\sr 39:1-23
\p
\v 1 Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt, and Potiphar, an Egyptian man, an official of Pharaoh, the chief of the guards, had bought him from the hand of the Ishmaelites who had taken him down there.
\v 2 And Yahweh was with Joseph, and he was a successful man, and he was in the house of his Egyptian master.

\ts\*
\v 3 And his master saw that Yahweh {was} with him and {that} Yahweh made all that he was doing successful in his hand.
\v 4 So Joseph found favor in his eyes, and he served him. And he put him in charge over his house and gave into his hand all {that} was his.

\ts\*
\v 5 And it happened from the time he put him in charge in his house and over all that was his, then Yahweh blessed the house of the Egyptian because of Joseph. So the blessing of Yahweh was on all that was his, in the house and in the fields.
\v 6 And he left all that {belonged} to him in the hand of Joseph, and he did not think to himself {about} anything except for the bread that he ate.
\p
Now Joseph was handsome in form and handsome in appearance.

\ts\*
\v 7 And it happened after those things, then the wife of his master lifted her eyes toward Joseph and said, “Lie with me!”
\v 8 But he refused and said to the wife of his master, “Behold, with me {here}, my master does not think {about} what {is} in the house, and all that is his he has given into my hand.
\v 9 He is not greater than me in this house, and he has not withheld anything from me except for you, because you {are} his wife. So how can I do this great evil, and sin against God?”

\ts\*
\v 10 And it happened, even though she kept speaking to Joseph day {after} day, yet he did not listen to her to lie beside her, to be with her.

\p
\v 11 Then it happened on such a day that he went into the house to do his work, and there were no other men of the house there in the house.
\v 12 So she caught him by his garment, saying, “Lie with me!” But he left his garment in her hand and fled and went outside.

\ts\*
\v 13 Then it happened when she saw that he had left his garment in her hands and had fled outside,
\v 14 then she called for the men of her house and said to them, saying, “Look! He brought to us a Hebrew man to laugh at us! He came to me to lie with me, but I called out with a loud voice!
\v 15 Then it happened when he heard that I raised my voice and called out, then he left his garment beside me and fled and went outside!”

\ts\*
\p
\v 16 Then she kept his garment beside her until his master came to his house.
\v 17 Then she spoke to him according to those words, saying, “The Hebrew slave whom you brought to us came to me to laugh at me!
\v 18 Then it happened when I raised my voice and called out, then he left his garment beside me and fled outside!”

\ts\*
\v 19 And it happened when his master heard the words of his wife that she spoke to him, saying, “Such {are} the things your slave did to me!” then his anger burned.
\v 20 Then Joseph’s master took him and put him in the round-house, the place where the prisoners of the king were bound.
\p
So he was there in the round-house,

\ts\*
\v 21 but Yahweh was with Joseph and showed kindness to him and gave him favor in the eyes of the chief of the round-house.
\v 22 And the chief of the round-house gave into the hand of Joseph all the prisoners who {were} in the round-house, and all that they were doing there, he was {the one} doing {it}.
\v 23 The chief of the round-house did not look {at} anything in his hand, because Yahweh was with him, and Yahweh made what he was doing successful.

\s1 The Chief Cupbearer’s and Chief Baker’s Dreams
\sr 40:1-23
\p
\v 1 Then it happened after those things {that} the cupbearer of the king of Egypt and the baker sinned against their lord, against the king of Egypt.
\v 2 And Pharaoh broke out in anger against his two officials, against the chief of the cupbearers and against the chief of the bakers,
\v 3 and he put them in custody in the house of the chief of the guards, in the round-house, the place where Joseph was bound.

\ts\*
\v 4 And the chief of the guards assigned Joseph to them, so he attended them, and they were in custody {for} days.

\p
\v 5 Then the two of them dreamed a dream. Each {had} his {own} dream in the same night, {and} each {man’s} dream had its own interpretation. {They were} the cupbearer and the baker who {belonged} to the king of Egypt, who were bound in the round-house.

\ts\*
\v 6 And Joseph came to them in the morning and saw them, and behold, they were upset.
\v 7 So he asked Pharaoh’s officials who {were} with him in custody {in} the house of his master, saying, “Why {are} your faces sad today?”
\v 8 And they said to him, “We dreamed a dream, but {there is} no one to interpret it.” Then Joseph said to them, “Don’t interpretations {belong} to God? Please tell {them} to me.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 9 Then the chief of the cupbearers told his dream to Joseph and said to him, “And behold, in my dream a grapevine {was} before me,
\v 10 and on the grapevine {were} three branches. Then while it was budding, its blossoms came out, {and} its clusters ripened {into} grapes.
\v 11 Then the cup of Pharaoh {was} in my hand and I took the grapes and squeezed them into the cup of Pharaoh. Then I put the cup into the hand of Pharaoh.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 12 Then Joseph said to him, “This {is} its interpretation: The three branches {are} three days.
\v 13 Within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head and restore you to your position, and you will put Pharaoh’s cup into his hand, according to the former custom when you were his cupbearer.

\ts\*
\v 14 But if you remember me with you, when it goes well for you, then please show kindness to me, and mention me to Pharaoh, and get me out from this house.
\v 15 For indeed, I was stolen from the land of the Hebrews. And also here I did not do anything that they should put me in the pit.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 16 And the chief of the bakers saw that he interpreted favorably, so he said to Joseph, “I also {was} in my dream, and behold, {there were} three baskets of white bread on my head.
\v 17 And in the top basket {were} all {kinds} of food for Pharaoh, baker’s goods, but the birds were eating them out of the basket on my head.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 18 Then Joseph responded and said, “This {is} its interpretation: The three baskets {are} three days.
\v 19 Within three days Pharaoh will lift up your head from you and hang you on a tree, and the birds will eat your flesh from you.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 20 Then it happened on the third day, the day Pharaoh was born, that he made a feast for all his servants. And he lifted up the head of the chief of the cupbearers and the head of the chief of the bakers in the presence of his servants.
\v 21 Then he restored the chief of the cupbearers to his position, and he put the cup into the hand of Pharaoh,
\v 22 but the chief of the bakers he hanged, just as Joseph had interpreted for them.

\v 23 However, the chief of the cupbearers did not remember Joseph but forgot him.

\s1 Pharaoh’s Two Dreams

\v 1 Then it happened {at} the end of two years of days that Pharaoh was dreaming and behold, he was standing beside the river.
\v 2 Then behold, from the river came up seven cows, fine-looking and fat-fleshed, and they grazed among the reeds.
\v 3 Then behold, seven other cows came up after them from the river, ugly-looking and thin-fleshed, and they stood beside the {other} cows on the bank of the river.

\ts\*
\v 4 Then the ugly-looking and thin-fleshed cows ate the seven fine-looking and fat cows, and Pharaoh woke up.

\p
\v 5 Then he fell asleep and dreamed a second {time}. And behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, fat and good.
\v 6 Then behold, seven heads of grain, thin and scorched {by} the east wind, sprouted after them.

\ts\*
\v 7 Then the thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven fat and full heads. Then Pharaoh woke up, and behold, {it was} a dream.

\p
\v 8 And it happened in the morning that his spirit was agitated, so he sent and called for all the magicians of Egypt and all its wise men. Then Pharaoh told his dreams to them, but no one could interpret them for Pharaoh.

\ts\*
\v 9 Then the chief of the cupbearers spoke with Pharaoh, saying, “Today I remember my offenses.
\v 10 Pharaoh broke out in anger against his servants, and he put me in custody {in} the house of the chief of the guards, me and the chief of the bakers.
\v 11 And we dreamed a dream in the same night, he and I; each of us dreamed according to the interpretation of his dream.

\ts\*
\v 12 Now there with us {was} a young Hebrew man, a servant for the chief of the guards. And we told {our dreams} to him, and he interpreted our dreams for us. He interpreted {for} each according to his dream.
\v 13 And it happened, just as he interpreted for us, so it happened: me he restored to my position, and him he hanged.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 14 Then Pharaoh sent and called for Joseph. So they quickly brought him from the pit. Then he shaved and changed his clothes and came to Pharaoh.
\v 15 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I dreamed a dream, but no one could interpret it. But I heard about you, saying {that} you hear a dream {and are able} to interpret it.”
\v 16 And Joseph responded to Pharaoh, saying, “{It is} not in me; God will answer with Pharaoh’s peace.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 17 Then Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, “In my dream, behold, I was standing on the bank of the river.
\v 18 Then behold, from the river came up seven cows, fat-fleshed and of fine form, and they grazed among the reeds.

\ts\*
\v 19 Then behold, seven other cows came up after them, poor and very ugly of form and thin-fleshed. I have not seen {cows} as ugly as those in all the land of Egypt!
\v 20 Then the thin and ugly cows ate the first seven fat cows.
\v 21 So they went into their bellies, but it could not be known that they had gone into their bellies, and their appearance {was} just as ugly as at the beginning. Then I woke up.

\ts\*
\p
\v 22 “Then I saw in my dream, and behold, seven heads of grain came up on one stalk, full and good.
\v 23 Then behold, seven heads of grain, withered, thin {and} scorched {by} the east wind sprouted after them.
\v 24 Then the thin heads of grain swallowed up the seven good heads of grain. And I told {this} to the magicians, but no one {could} explain {it} to me.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 25 Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, “Pharaoh’s dreams {are} one. What God is doing, he has shown to Pharaoh.
\v 26 The seven good cows {are} seven years, and the seven good heads of grain {are} seven years. The dreams {are} one.

\ts\*
\v 27 And the seven thin and ugly cows that came up after them {are} seven years, and {so are} the seven thin heads of grain scorched by the east wind. There will be seven years of famine.
\v 28 That {is} the word that I have spoken to Pharaoh: What God is doing he has shown to Pharaoh.
\v 29 Behold, seven years are coming {of} great abundance in all the land of Egypt.

\ts\*
\v 30 But seven years of famine will rise up after them, so that all the abundance in the land of Egypt will be forgotten, and the famine will consume the land.
\v 31 And the abundance in the land will not be remembered because of that famine after it, because it {will be} very heavy.
\v 32 And as for the repeating of the dream to Pharaoh twice, {it is} because the matter has been established by God, and God will soon do it.

\p
\v 33 “And now let Pharaoh seek a man {who is} discerning and wise, and set him over the land of Egypt.
\v 34 Let Pharaoh do {this}: Let him set supervisors over the land, and let him take a fifth of the land of Egypt in the seven years of abundance.

\ts\*
\v 35 And they should gather all the food of the good years that are coming. And they should store {that} grain under Pharaoh’s hand {for} food in the cities and guard {it}.

\v 39 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Since God has shown all this to you, {there is} no one {as} discerning and wise as you.
\v 40 You will be over my house, and all my people will kiss on your mouth. Only I {on} the throne will be greater than you.”
\v 41 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “See, I have put you over all the land of Egypt.”

\v 44 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I {am} Pharaoh, and without you a person will not lift his hand or his foot in all the land of Egypt!”
\v 45 Then Pharaoh called Joseph’s name Zaphenath-Paneah, and he gave to him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera the priest of On, as a wife. Then Joseph went out over the land of Egypt.

\p
\v 46 Now Joseph {was} a son of thirty years when he stood before Pharaoh king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of Pharaoh and passed through all the land of Egypt.
\v 47 And in the seven years of abundance, the land produced {grain} by the handfuls.

\ts\*
\v 48 So he gathered all the food of the seven years that were in the land of Egypt, and he put the food in the cities. The food of the fields that surrounded {each} city he put inside it.
\v 49 So Joseph stored up grain like the sand of the sea, very much, until he stopped measuring {it} because it was without number.

\ts\*
\p
\v 50 And before the years of the famine came, two sons were born to Joseph, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, the priest of On, bore for him.

\v 52 And the name of the second {son} he called Ephraim, because {he said}, “God has made me fruitful in the land of my affliction.”

\ts\*

\v 53 Then the seven years of abundance that was in the land of Egypt ended,

\v 55 Then all the land of Egypt became famished, and the people cried to Pharaoh for the bread. So Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph. Whatever he says to you, do {it}.”
\v 56 And the famine was over all the face of the land, so Joseph opened all {the buildings} that {had grain} in them and sold {grain} to the Egyptians. And the famine was severe in the land of Egypt.

\v 3 Then ten of Joseph’s brothers went down to buy grain from Egypt.
\v 4 But Jacob did not send Benjamin, the brother of Joseph, with his brothers, because he said, “So that harm does not meet him!”

\ts\*

\v 5 And the sons of Israel came among {those} who came to buy {grain}, because the famine was in the land of Canaan.
\v 6 Now Joseph {was} the governor over the land. {It was} he who was selling {grain} to all the people of the land. So the brothers of Joseph came and bowed down to him {with} {their} noses to the ground.

\ts\*
\v 7 And Joseph saw his brothers and recognized them, but he acted like a stranger to them, and he spoke with them harshly and said to them, “Where did you come from?” And they said, “From the land of Canaan to buy food.”
\v 8 And Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him.

\v 11 All of us {are} sons of one man. We {are} honest. Your servants are not spies.”

\v 14 Then Joseph said to them, “It {is} just as I told you, saying, ‘You {are} spies!’
\v 15 By this you will be tested: {By} the life of Pharaoh, you will not leave from this {place} unless your youngest brother comes here.
\v 16 Send one of you, and let him bring your brother, and you will be bound. Then your words will be tested {as to whether} the truth {is} in you. And if not, {by} the life of Pharaoh, surely you {are} spies!”
\v 17 Then he put them together in custody {for} three days.

\p
\v 18 Then Joseph said to them on the third day, “Do this and live, {because} I fear God:
\v 19 If you {are} honest, let one of your brothers be bound in your prison house, and you go take grain back {for} the famine of your households.
\v 20 Then you will bring your youngest brother to me so that your words will be verified, and you will not die.” And they did so.

\ts\*
\p
\v 21 Then each {man} said to his brother, “We {are} truly guilty concerning our brother, because we saw the distress of his soul when he pleaded with us, but we did not listen. For that {reason} this distress has come upon us.”
\v 22 Then Reuben responded to them, saying, “Did I not tell you, saying, ‘Do not sin against the lad’? But you did not listen, so now behold, his blood is being accounted for!”

\v 23 And they did not know that Joseph understood {them}, because the interpreter {was} between them.

\v 25 Then Joseph ordered {his servants} and they filled their bags {with} grain. And {he ordered them} to return {each} man’s silver to his sack and to give provisions to them for the road. And he did that for them.

\ts\*
\v 26 Then they loaded their grain onto their donkeys and went from there.

\p
\v 27 Then one {of them} opened his sack to give fodder to his donkey at the lodging place, and he saw his silver, and behold, it {was} in the mouth of his sack!
\v 28 So he said to his brothers, “My silver has been returned! And indeed behold, {it is} in my sack!” Then their hearts went out, and each {man} trembled to his brother, saying, “What {is} this God has done to us?”

\ts\*
\p
\v 29 Then they came to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan, and they reported to him all that had happened to them, saying,
\v 30 “The man, the lord of the land, spoke to us harshly and treated us as {if we were} spying out the land!
\v 31 But we said to him, ‘We {are} honest. We are not spies.
\v 32 We {are} twelve brothers, the sons of our father. The one is not {alive}, and the youngest {is} with our father today in the land of Canaan.’

\ts\*
\p
\v 33 “Then the man, the lord of the land, said to us, ‘By this I will know that you {are} honest: Leave one of your brothers with me, and take {grain} {for} the famine of your households and go.
\v 34 Then bring your youngest brother to me so that I will know that you {are} not spies, that you {are} honest. {Then} I will give your brother to you, and you {can} trade {in} the land.’”

\ts\*
\p
\v 35 Then it happened they were emptying their sacks, and behold, each {man’s} pouch of his silver {was} inside his sack! And they and their father saw the pouches of their silver, and they were afraid.
\v 36 Then Jacob their father said to them, “You have bereaved me! Joseph is not {here}! And Simeon is not {here}! And you will take Benjamin! All {these} things are against me!”

\ts\*
\p
\v 37 Then Reuben said to his father, saying, “You may kill my two sons if I do not bring him to you. Put him in my hand, and I will return him to you.”
\v 38 But he said, “My son will not go down with you, because his brother is dead, and he alone is left. And {if} harm were to meet him on the road that you are going on, then you would bring my gray head down in sorrow to Sheol!”

\s1 Joseph’s Brothers, including Benjamin, Return to the Country of Egypt
\sr 43:1-34
\p
\v 1 Now the famine {was} heavy in the land.
\v 2 So it happened when they finished eating the grain that they had brought from Egypt, then their father said to them, “Return, buy a little food for us.”

\ts\*
\v 3 But Judah said to him, saying, “The man strongly warned us, saying, ‘You will not see my face unless your brother {is} with you!’
\v 4 If you will send our brother with us, we will go down and buy food for you.
\v 5 But if you will not send {him}, we will not go down, because the man said to us, ‘You will not see my face unless your brother {is} with you!’”

\ts\*
\p
\v 6 Then Israel said, “Why did you treat me badly by telling the man you have yet {another} brother?”
\v 7 And they said, “The man asked persistently about us and our relatives, saying, ‘Is your father still alive? Do you have {another} brother?’ And we answered him according to those words. How could we possibly know that he would say, ‘Bring your brother down’?”

\ts\*
\p
\v 8 Then Judah said to Israel his father, “Send the young man with me, and we will get up and go so that both we and you and our little ones will live and not die.
\v 9 I myself will guarantee him. From my hand you can require him. If I do not bring him {back} to you and set him before you, then I will have sinned against you all the days.
\v 10 Surely if we had not delayed, surely we could have returned here twice by now.”

\ts\*
\v 11 Then Israel their father said to them, “If {it must be} so, then do this: Take {some} of the choice produce of the land in your bags, and take {it} down to the man {as} a gift: a little balm, and a little honey, spices and myrrh, pistachio nuts and almonds.
\v 12 And take double the silver in your hand{s}, because you must return in your hand{s} the silver that was returned in the mouth of your sacks. Perhaps it {was} a mistake.

\ts\*
\v 13 So take your brother and get up, return to the man.
\v 14 And may God Almighty give you mercies before the man, and may he send your other brother and Benjamin with you. And I, if I am bereaved, I am bereaved.”

\p
\v 15 Then the men took that gift, and they took double the silver in their hand{s}, and Benjamin. Then they got up and went down {to} Egypt and stood before Joseph.

\ts\*
\v 16 And Joseph saw Benjamin with them. Then he said to {the one} who {was} over his house, “Take the men to the house, and slaughter an animal and prepare {a meal}, because the men will eat with me at noon.”

\p
\v 17 So the man did just as Joseph {had} said, and the man brought the men to Joseph’s house.

\ts\*
\v 18 And the men were afraid when they were brought {to} Joseph’s house, and they said, “Because of the matter of the silver that was returned in our sacks the first time, we have been brought. {He wants} to roll himself over us and throw himself on us and take us as slaves, and our donkeys!”

\p
\v 19 Then they went near to the man who {was} over Joseph’s house and spoke to him {at} the entrance of the house.
\v 20 And they said, “Please, my lord, we surely came down {here} the first time to buy food.

\ts\*
\v 21 But it happened when we came to the lodging place, we opened our sacks and behold, {each} man’s silver {was} in the mouth of his sack; our silver {was there} in its {full} weight! So we have brought it back in our hand{s}.
\v 22 And we have brought down other silver in our hand{s} to buy food. We do not know who put our silver in our sacks.”
\v 23 But he said, “Peace {be} to you, do not be afraid. Your God and the God of your father has given you hidden treasure in your sacks; your silver came to me.” Then he brought Simeon out to them.

\ts\*
\p
\v 24 Then the man took the men into Joseph’s house and gave {them} water, and they washed their feet, and he gave fodder to their donkeys.
\v 25 And they prepared the gift for Joseph’s arrival at noon, because they had heard that they would eat bread there.

\ts\*
\p
\v 26 Then Joseph came to the house, and they brought to him the gift that {was} in their hand{s} into the house, and they bowed down to him to the ground.
\v 27 Then he asked them about {their} wellbeing, and he said, “{Are things} well {for} your aged father whom you spoke about? Is he still alive?”

\ts\*
\v 28 And they said, “{Things are} well for your servant our father. He {is} still alive.” Then they bowed and bowed down.

\p
\v 29 Then he lifted his eyes and saw Benjamin his brother, the son of his mother, and he said, “Is this your youngest brother whom you spoke to me {about}?” Then he said, “May God be gracious to you, my son.”

\ts\*
\v 30 Then Joseph hurried out, because his emotions boiled over for his brother, and he sought to cry, and he went to the inner room and cried there.

\p
\v 31 Then he washed his face and came out. Then he controlled himself and said, “Serve the bread.”

\ts\*
\v 32 So they served to him by himself, and to them by themselves, and to the Egyptians who were eating with him by themselves, because Egyptians cannot eat bread with Hebrews, because that {is} an abomination to Egyptians.
\v 33 And they were sitting before him, the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth, and the men were astonished each to his neighbor.
\v 34 Then he served to them servings {of food} from before him, but Benjamin’s serving was five times larger than any of their servings. And they drank and became drunk with him.

\s1 Joseph’s Cup
\sr 44:1-17
\p
\v 1 Then he commanded {the one} who {was} over his house, saying, “Fill the men’s sacks {with} food, as much as they are able to carry, and put the silver of each {one} in the mouth of his sack.
\v 2 And put my cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest {one}, and his grain’s silver.” So he did according to Joseph’s word that he spoke.

\ts\*
\p
\v 3 The morning became light, and the men were sent off, they and their donkeys.
\v 4 They had left the city, they had not gone far, and Joseph said to {the one} who {was} over his house, “Get up, follow after the men, and {when} you overtake them, then say to them, ‘Why have you repaid evil for good?
\v 5 Is this not what my lord drinks from and what he indeed divines with? You have done evil {in} what you have done!’”

\ts\*
\p
\v 6 Then he overtook them and spoke those words to them.
\v 7 But they said to him, “Why does my lord speak words like those? Far be it from your servants to do something like that!

\ts\*
\v 8 Behold, the silver that we found in the mouth of our sacks we brought back to you from the land of Canaan. So how would we steal silver or gold from the house of your lord?
\v 9 Whoever of your servants is found with it, then he will die, and we also will be slaves for my lord.”

\p
\v 10 And he said, “Indeed now, according to your words, so it {will be}: Whoever is found with it will be a slave for me, but you {others} will be blameless.”

\ts\*
\v 11 Then they each hurried and lowered his sack to the ground, and they each opened his sack.
\v 12 Then he searched, beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest, and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack!
\v 13 Then they tore their clothes, and each {one} loaded up his donkey, and they returned to the city.

\ts\*
\p
\v 14 Then Judah and his brothers came to Joseph’s house, and he was still there, so they fell to the ground before him.
\v 15 Then Joseph said to them, “What {is} this deed that you have done? Did you not know that a man who {is} like me indeed divines?”

\ts\*
\v 16 And Judah said, “What can we say to my lord? What can we speak? And how can we justify ourselves? God has found out the sin of your servants. Behold, we {are} slaves for my lord, both we and {the one} in whose hand the cup was found.”
\v 17 But he said, “Far be it from me to do that! The man in whose hand the cup was found, he will be a slave for me. But you, go up in peace to your father.”

\v 18 Then Judah went near to him and said, “Please, my lord, please let your servant speak a word in my lord’s ears, and do not let your anger burn against your servant, since you {are} like Pharaoh.
\v 19 My lord asked his servants, saying, ‘Do you have a father or {another} brother?’

\ts\*
\v 20 And we said to my lord, ‘We have an aged father and the youngest son of {his} old age. But his brother is dead, so he is left by himself from his mother, and his father loves him.’

\p
\v 21 “Then you said to your servants, ‘Bring him down to me, and I will set my eyes on him.’
\v 22 And we said to my lord, ‘The young man is not able to leave his father, because {if} he leaves his father, then he will die.’

\ts\*
\v 23 But you said to your servants, ‘If your youngest brother does not come down with you, you will not see my face again.’

\v 24 “And it happened when we went up to your servant my father, then we related to him the words of my lord.
\v 25 Then our father said, ‘Return, buy a little food for us.’
\v 26 But we said, ‘We cannot go down. {But} if our youngest brother is with us, then we will go. For we are not able to see the man’s face and our youngest brother not {be} with us.’

\ts\*
\v 27 Then your servant my father said to us, ‘You know that my wife bore two {sons} for me.
\v 28 And the one went away from me, and I have said, “He was surely torn to pieces,” and I have not seen him until now.
\v 29 So {if} you also take this {one} from my presence, and harm were to meet him, then you would bring my gray head down in misery to Sheol.’

\ts\*
\p
\v 30 “And now, when I go to your servant my father and the young man is not with us, since his soul is bound to his soul,

\s1 Joseph Reveals His Identity to His Brothers

\v 1 Then Joseph was not able to control himself before all who were standing by him, and he called out, “Have every man leave from beside me!” So no man stood with him when Joseph revealed himself to his brothers.
\v 2 And he gave his voice in crying, and the Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard.
\v 3 Then Joseph said to his brothers, “I {am} Joseph! Is my father still alive?” But his brothers were not able to answer him, because they were terrified at his presence.

\ts\*
\p
\v 4 Then Joseph said to his brothers, “Please come close to me.” So they came close, and he said, “I {am} Joseph your brother, whom you sold into Egypt.
\v 5 And now, do not be grieved and do not let it burn in your eyes that you sold me here, because God sent me ahead of you for the preservation of life.
\v 6 For this {is} two years the famine {has been} in the midst of the land, and {there are} still five years {in} which {there will} not be plowing and harvesting.

\ts\*
\v 7 But God sent me ahead of you to preserve a remnant for you on the earth, and to keep you alive by a great deliverance.
\v 8 So now, {it was} not you {who} sent me here, but God. And he has made me father to Pharaoh, and lord over all his house and the ruler in all the land of Egypt.

\p
\v 9 “Hurry and go up to my father and say to him, ‘This {is what} your son Joseph says, “God has made me lord over all Egypt. Come down to me, do not delay.
\v 10 And you will live in the land of Goshen so that you will be near to me—you and your children and your children’s children and your flocks and your herds and all that {belongs} to you.
\v 11 And I will provide for you there, because {there are} still five years of famine, so that you will not become impoverished, you and your household and all that {belongs} to you.”’

\ts\*
\p
\v 12 “And behold, your eyes and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see that {it is} my mouth that is speaking to you.
\v 13 So report to my father all my glory in Egypt and all that you have seen. Then hurry and bring my father down here.”

\v 15 Then he kissed all his brothers and cried over them. And after that his brothers talked with him.

\p
\v 16 And the report was heard {in} the house of Pharaoh, saying, “The brothers of Joseph have come.” And it was good in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants.
\v 17 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Say to your brothers, ‘Do this: Load your animals and leave; go to the land of Canaan.
\v 18 Then get your father and your households, and come to me, and I will give to you the best of the land of Egypt, and you will eat the fat of the land.’

\p
\v 21 Then the sons of Israel did so. And Joseph gave to them carts according to the mouth of Pharaoh, and he gave provisions to them for the road.

\v 24 Then he sent his brothers, and {as} they left, then he said to them, “Do not quarrel on the road.”

\v 13 Now there was no bread in all the earth, because the famine {was} very heavy, and the land of Egypt and the land of Canaan were languishing because of the famine.

\v 15 So the silver was consumed from the land of Egypt and from the land of Canaan, and all Egypt came to Joseph, saying, “Give us bread! And why should we die before you? For the silver is gone!”
\v 16 And Joseph said, “Bring your livestock and I will give {grain} to you {in exchange} for your livestock, since the silver is gone.”
\v 17 So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph gave bread to them {in exchange} for the horses and for the herd{s} of sheep and for the herd{s} of cattle and for the donkeys. So he provided them with bread in that year {in exchange} for all their livestock.

\ts\*
\p
\v 18 And {when} that year had ended, then they came to him in the second year and said to him, “We cannot hide {it} from my lord that since the silver is consumed and the herd{s} of livestock {belong} to my lord, there is nothing left before my lord except our bodies and our lands.
\v 19 Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land {in exchange} for the bread, and we and our land will be slaves to Pharaoh. Give {us} seed so that we will live and not die, and the land will not be desolate!”

\ts\*

\v 20 Then Joseph bought all the {farm}land of Egypt for Pharaoh, because every Egyptian sold his field, because the famine was heavy for them. So the land became Pharaoh’s.
\v 21 And {as for} the people, he moved them to the cities from {one} end of the border of Egypt to its {other} end.
\v 22 Only the land of the priests he did not buy, because {there was} an allotment for the priests from Pharaoh, and they ate {from} their allotment that Pharaoh gave to them. For that {reason} they did not sell their land.

\p
\v 23 Then Joseph said to the people, “Behold, today I have bought you and your land for Pharaoh. Here {is} seed for you so that you can sow the ground.
\v 24 And it will happen in the harvests that you must give a fifth to Pharaoh, and the four parts will be for you as seed of the field and as your food and for those in your houses and for your little ones to eat.”

\v 25 And they said, “You have kept us alive! Let us find favor in the eyes of my lord, and we will be slaves for Pharaoh.”

\s1 Jacob Blesses Joseph’s Sons Ephraim and Manasseh
\sr 48:1-22
\p
\v 1 Then it happened after those things that {someone} said to Joseph, “Behold, your father is sick.” So he took his two sons with him, Manasseh and Ephraim.
\v 2 And {someone} announced to Jacob and said, “Behold, your son Joseph has come to you.” Then Israel gathered his strength and sat up on the bed.

\ts\*
\v 3 Then Jacob said to Joseph, “God Almighty appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and he blessed me
\v 4 and said to me, ‘Behold, I am making you fruitful, and I will multiply you and make you into a community of peoples. And I will give this land to your offspring after you {as} an everlasting possession.’

\v 5 “And now, your two sons, who were born for you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, they {are} mine, Ephraim and Manasseh, just as Reuben and Simeon are mine.
\v 6 But your children whom you father after them will be yours. They will be called by the name of their brothers in their inheritance.
\v 7 And I, as I was coming from Paddan, Rachel died beside me in the land of Canaan on the way, while {there was} still a distance of land to go to Ephrath. And I buried her there beside the road of Ephrath, which {is} Bethlehem.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 8 Then Israel saw the sons of Joseph and said, “Who {are} these?”
\v 9 And Joseph said to his father, “They {are} my sons whom God has given to me in this {place}.” Then he said, “Please bring them to me, and I will bless them.”
\v 10 Now the eyes of Israel were heavy from age, {so that} he was not able to see. So he brought them near to him, and he kissed them and embraced them.

\ts\*
\v 11 Then Israel said to Joseph, “I did not expect to see your face, but behold, God has let me see also your offspring!”
\v 12 Then Joseph removed them from beside his knees, and he bowed down with his nose to the ground.

\p
\v 13 Then Joseph took both of them, Ephraim on his right toward Israel’s left and Manasseh on his left toward Israel’s right, and brought {them} near to him.

\ts\*
\v 14 But Israel extended his right hand and placed {it} on the head of Ephraim, and he {was} the younger, and {he placed} his left hand on the head of Manasseh. He guided his hands, because Manasseh {was} the firstborn.
\v 15 Then he blessed Joseph and said,
\q1
“May the God whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked before,
\q1
the God who has been shepherding me from since I {was born} until this day,
\q1 \v 16 the Angel who has redeemed me from all evil,
\q1
may he bless {these} boys,
\q1
and may my name be called in them, and the name of my fathers Abraham and Isaac,
\q1
and may they grow into a multitude in the midst of the earth.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 17 And Joseph saw that his father had placed his right hand on the head of Ephraim, and it was displeasing in his eyes, so he took hold of the hand of his father to move it from the head of Ephraim to the head of Manasseh.
\v 18 And Joseph said to his father, “Not so, my father, because that {one} {is} the firstborn son. Put your right hand on his head.”

\ts\*
\v 19 But his father refused and said, “I know, my son, I know. He will also become a people, and he will also be great. Nevertheless his younger brother will be greater than he, and his offspring will become a multitude of nations.”
\v 20 And he blessed them on that day, saying,
\q1
“By you Israel will bless {people}, saying,
\q2
‘May God make you like Ephraim and like Manasseh.’”
\p
So he put Ephraim before Manasseh.
\ts\*
\p
\v 21 Then Israel said to Joseph, “Behold, I am dying, and God will be with you, and he will bring you back to the land of your fathers.
\v 22 And I give you Shechem, one {portion} above your brothers, which I took from the hand of the Amorite{s} with my sword and with my bow.”
