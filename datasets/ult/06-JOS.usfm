\v 1 Now it happened after the death of Moses the servant of Yahweh, that Yahweh spoke to Joshua, the son of Nun, the assistant of Moses, saying,
\v 2 “Moses, my servant, is dead. And now, arise, cross over this Jordan, you and all of this people, to the land that I {am} giving to them, to the sons of Israel.
\v 3 Every place that the sole of your foot will tread upon, I have given it to you, just as I spoke to Moses.

\ts\*
\v 4 From the wilderness and this Lebanon and unto the Great River, the Euphrates River, all of the land of the Hittites, and unto the Great Sea, from the going of the sun, will be your territory.
\v 5 No man will {be able to} stand to your face all of the days of your life. I will be with you just as I was with Moses. I will not abandon you and I will not leave you.

\ts\*
\v 6 Be strong and be courageous, for you yourself will cause this people to inherit the land that I swore to their fathers to give to them.
\v 7 Only be strong and be very courageous, to be careful to do according to all of the law that Moses, my servant, commanded you. Do not turn aside from it {to} the right or {to} the left, so that you may succeed in every {place} where you go.

\ts\*
\v 8 This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth but you shall meditate on it day and night, so that you will be careful to do according to everything written in it. For then you will make your ways prosperous and then you will succeed.
\v 9 Have I not commanded you? Be strong and be courageous! Do not be terrified and do not be dismayed, for Yahweh your God {is} with you in every {place} where you go.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 10 Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,
\v 11 “Pass through the midst of the camp and command the people, saying, ‘Prepare provisions for yourselves, because within three days you are crossing over this Jordan to enter to possess the land that Yahweh your God is giving to you to possess it.’”

\ts\*
\p
\v 12 And to the Reubenite and to the Gadite and to the half of the tribe of Manasseh, Joshua spoke, saying,
\v 13 “Remember the word that Moses the servant of Yahweh commanded you, saying, ‘Yahweh your God {is} giving rest to you, and he will give to you this land.’

\ts\*
\v 14 Your wives, your little ones, and your livestock may remain in the land that Moses gave to you on the other side of the Jordan. But you yourselves, being armed, shall cross over to the face of your brothers, all of the warriors of valor, and you shall help them
\v 15 until when Yahweh gives rest to your brothers, as {to} you, and they possess, they too, the land that Yahweh your God {is} giving to them. Then you shall return to the land of your possession and you shall possess it, which Moses the servant of Yahweh gave to you on the other side of the Jordan, {toward} the rising of the sun.”

\ts\*
\v 16 And they answered Joshua, saying, “All of what you have commanded us, we will do, and to everywhere you send us, we will go.
\v 17 As {with} all of what we listened to Moses, so we will listen to you. Only may Yahweh your God {be} with you, just as he {was} with Moses.
\v 18 Every man who disobeys your mouth and will not hear your words according to all of what you command him shall be put to death. Only be strong and be courageous.”

\p
\v 1 And Joshua, the son of Nun, secretly sent from Shittim two men, spies, saying, “Go, see the land and Jericho.” And they went and entered the house of a woman, a prostitute, and her name {was} Rahab, and they stayed there.
\v 2 And it was said to the king of Jericho, saying, “Behold, men have come here tonight from the sons of Israel to search out the land.”
\v 3 Then the king of Jericho sent to Rahab, saying, “Bring out the men, the ones coming to you, who came to your house, because they have come to search out all of the land.”

\ts\*
\v 4 But the woman had taken the two men and had hidden them. And she said, “Indeed, the men came to me, but I did not know from where they {were}.
\v 5 And the gate was to shut at darkness, and the men went out. I do not know where the men went. Pursue quickly after them, for you may overtake them.”

\ts\*
\v 6 (Now she had brought them up to the roof and had hidden them in the stalks of flax arranged by her on the roof.)
\v 7 So the men pursued after them {on} the road of the Jordan to the fords. And they shut the gate after when the pursuers had gone out after them.

\ts\*
\p
\v 8 Now before they lay down, she went up to them on the roof.
\v 9 And she said to the men, “I know that Yahweh has given the land to you and that the dread of you has fallen on us and that all the dwellers of the land have melted from your faces.

\ts\*
\v 10 For we have heard that Yahweh dried up the water of the Sea of Reeds from your faces in your going out from Egypt, and what you did to two of the kings of the Amorite who {were} on the other side of the Jordan, to Sihon and to Og, that you devoted them.
\v 11 And we have heard, and our heart has melted, and the spirit in a man no longer stands from your faces. For Yahweh your God, he {is} God in the heavens above and on the earth below.

\ts\*
\v 12 And now, please swear to me by Yahweh, since I am doing kindness with you, that you yourselves will also do kindness with the house of my father, and give to me a sign of truth,
\v 13 that you will keep alive my father and my mother and my brothers and my sisters and all who {are} to them and you will deliver our lives from death.”

\ts\*
\v 14 And the men said to her, “Our lives in place of yours to die! If you do not tell this matter of ours, then it will happen, in Yahweh’s giving the land to us, that we will do kindness and faithfulness with you.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 15 Then she lowered them down by a rope through the window (for her house {was} in the side of the wall, so she was dwelling in the wall).
\v 16 And she said to them, “Go to the hill country, lest the pursuers meet you. And hide there three days, until the pursuers have returned. And afterwards you may go your way.”
\v 17 And the men said to her, “We {will be} innocent from this oath of yours that you have made us swear:

\ts\*
\v 18 Behold us, coming into the land! You shall tie this cord of thread of scarlet in the window through which you lower us down, and your father and your mother and your brothers and all of the house of your father, you shall gather to you at the house.
\v 19 And it will be, anyone who goes out from the doors of your house to the outside, his blood {will be} on his head and we {will be} innocent. But anyone who is with you in the house, his blood {will be} on our head if a hand shall be on him.

\ts\*
\v 20 But if you tell this matter of ours, then we will be innocent from your oath that you have made us swear.”
\v 21 And she said, “According to your words, so {be} it.” And she sent them away, and they went. And she tied the cord of scarlet in the window.
\ts\*
\p
\v 22 And they went and came to the hill country, and they stayed there three days, until the pursuers had returned. And the pursuers searched along all of the road, but they did not find them.
\v 23 And the two men returned and descended from the hill country and crossed over and came to Joshua, the son of Nun, and they recounted to him all of the things having found them.
\v 24 And they said to Joshua, “Truly Yahweh has given all of the land into our hand, for indeed, all of the dwellers of the land are melting from our faces.”

\c 3
\p
\v 1 And Joshua rose early in the morning, and they set out from Shittim. And they came unto the Jordan, he and all of the sons of Israel, and they lodged there before they crossed over.
\v 2 And it happened at the end of three days, that the officers passed through the midst of the camp.
\v 3 And they commanded the people, saying, “As you see the Box of the Covenant of Yahweh your God and the priests, the Levites, carrying it, then you yourselves shall set out from your place and go after it—
\v 4 but a distance shall be between you and between it, about 2, 000 cubits in measurement; do not come near to it—so that you will know the way in which you should go, since you have not passed over by the way from yesterday {or} the third day.”
\p
\v 5 And Joshua said to the people, “Consecrate yourselves, for tomorrow Yahweh will do wonders in your midst.”
\v 6 And Joshua spoke to the priests, saying, “Lift up the Box of the Covenant and cross over to the face of the people.” And they lifted up the Box of the Covenant and went to the face of the people.
\p
\v 7 And Yahweh said to Joshua, “This day I will begin to make you great in the eyes of all of Israel, who will know that just as I was with Moses, I am with you.
\v 8 And you, you shall command the priests, the carriers of the Box of the Covenant, saying, ‘As you come unto the edge of the waters of the Jordan, in the Jordan you shall stand.’”
\p
\v 9 And Joshua said to the sons of Israel, “Approach here and hear the words of Yahweh your God.”
\v 10 And Joshua said, “By this you will know that the living God {is} in your midst and dispossessing, he will dispossess from your face the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Hivite and the Perizzite and the Girgashite and the Amorite and the Jebusite.
\v 11 Behold, the Box of the Covenant of the Lord of all of the earth crossing over to your faces in the Jordan.
\v 12 And now, take for yourselves 12 men from the tribes of Israel, one man, one man to a tribe.
\v 13 And it will happen as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests, the carriers of the Box of Yahweh, the Lord of all of the earth, rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan will be cut off, the waters coming down from above. And they will stand, one heap.”
\p
\v 14 And it happened, when the people set out from their tents to cross over the Jordan, that the priests, the carriers of the Box of the Covenant, were to the face of the people.
\v 15 And as the carriers of the Box came unto the Jordan then the feet of the priests, the carriers of the Box, were dipped into the edge of the water. (Now the Jordan was full over all of its banks all of the days of the harvest.)
\v 16 Then the waters coming down from above stood {still}. They rose up, one heap, at a great distance away, at Adam, the city that {is} beside Zarethan, and those going down to the sea of Arabah, the Sea of Salt, were completely cut off. (Now the people crossed over opposite Jericho.)
\v 17 So the priests, the carriers of the Box of the Covenant of Yahweh, stood firmly on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan. And all of Israel {was} crossing over on dry ground until when all of the nation had finished crossing over the Jordan.

\c 4
\p
\v 1 And it happened, when all of the nation had finished crossing over the Jordan, that Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying,
\v 2 “Take 12 men for yourselves from the people, one man, one man from a tribe,
\v 3 and command them, saying: ‘Lift up for yourselves from here, from the midst of the Jordan, from the firm standing place of the feet of the priests, 12 stones. And you shall bring them over with you and you shall leave them in the lodging place in which you will lodge tonight.’”
\p
\v 4 So Joshua called to the 12 men whom he had appointed from the sons of Israel, one man, one man from a tribe.
\v 5 And Joshua said to them, “Cross over to the face of the Box of Yahweh your God into the midst of the Jordan. And lift up for yourselves, a man one stone, upon his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel,
\v 6 so that this will be a sign in your midst. When your sons ask tomorrow, saying, ‘What {are} these stones to you?’
\v 7 then you shall say to them, ‘Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off from the face of the Box of the Covenant of Yahweh. In its crossing over in the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off.’ And these stones will be for a memorial to the sons of Israel forever.”
\p
\v 8 And the sons of Israel did so, just as Joshua commanded. And they lifted up 12 stones from the midst of the Jordan, just as Yahweh had said to Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel. And they brought them over with them to the lodging place and they left them there.
\v 9 And Joshua set up 12 stones in the midst of the Jordan, under the standing place of the feet of the priests, the carriers of the Box of the Covenant. And they are there to this day.
\v 10 And the priests, the carriers of the Box, stood in the midst of the Jordan until the finishing of all of the thing that Yahweh had commanded Joshua to speak to the people, according to all of what Moses had commanded Joshua. And the people hurried and crossed over.
\v 11 And it happened, when all of the people had finished crossing over, that the Box of Yahweh and the priests crossed over to the face of the people.
\v 12 And the sons of Reuben, and the sons of Gad, and the half of the tribe of Manasseh crossed over armed to the face of the sons of Israel, just as Moses had spoken to them.
\v 13 About 40, 000 equipped {ones} of the army crossed over to the face of Yahweh to the plains of Jericho for battle.
\p
\v 14 On that day Yahweh made Joshua great in the eyes of all of Israel, and they feared him just as they had feared Moses all of the days of his life.
\p
\v 15 And Yahweh spoke to Joshua, saying,
\v 16 “Command the priests, the carriers of the Box of the Testimony, and they shall come up from the Jordan.”
\v 17 And Joshua commanded the priests, saying, “Come up from the Jordan.”
\v 18 And it happened that when the priests, the carriers of the Box of the Covenant of Yahweh, came up from the midst of the Jordan, {when} the soles of the feet of the priests were lifted up to dry ground, then the waters of the Jordan returned to their place and went over all of its banks, as yesterday and the third day.
\p
\v 19 Now the people came up from the Jordan on the tenth {day} of the first month. And they camped in Gilgal, on the east border of Jericho.
\v 20 And those 12 stones that they had taken from the Jordan, Joshua set up at Gilgal.
\v 21 And he spoke to the sons of Israel, saying, “When your sons ask their fathers tomorrow, saying, ‘What are these stones?’
\v 22 then you shall cause your sons to know, saying, ‘Israel crossed over this Jordan on dry ground.’
\v 23 For Yahweh your God dried up the waters of the Jordan from your faces until you crossed over, just as Yahweh your God did to the Sea of Reeds, which he dried up before us until we had crossed over,
\v 24 so that all of the peoples of the earth may know the hand of Yahweh, that it is mighty, so that you will fear Yahweh your God all of the days.”

\c 5
\p
\v 1 And it happened that when all of the kings of the Amorite who {were} on the other side of the Jordan, toward the sea, and all of the kings of the Canaanite who {were} beside the sea heard that Yahweh had dried up the waters of the Jordan from the face of the sons of Israel until they had crossed over, then their heart melted, and a spirit was no longer in them from the face of the sons of Israel.
\p
\v 2 At that time Yahweh said to Joshua, “Make for yourself knives of flint and again, circumcise the sons of Israel a second time.”
\v 3 So Joshua made for himself knives of flint. And he circumcised the sons of Israel at Gibeath Haaraloth.
\v 4 And this {is} the reason that Joshua circumcised {them}: All of the people having come out from Egypt, the males, all of the men of war, had died in the wilderness on the way, in their coming out from Egypt.
\v 5 For all of the people having come out were circumcised, but all the people born in the wilderness on the way in their coming out from Egypt they did not circumcise.
\v 6 For the sons of Israel had walked in the wilderness 40 years, until the finishing of all of the nation of the men of war having come out from Egypt, because they had not listened to the voice of Yahweh, to whom Yahweh had sworn not to let them see the land that Yahweh had sworn to their fathers to give to us, a land flowing {with} milk and honey.
\v 7 And he raised up their sons instead of them; Joshua circumcised them. For they were uncircumcised because they had not circumcised them on the way.
\v 8 And it happened when all of the nation had finished being circumcised, that they stayed in their places in the camp until their recovering.
\v 9 And Yahweh said to Joshua, “Today I have rolled away the disgrace of Egypt from upon you.” So one calls the name of that place Gilgal to this day.
\p
\v 10 And the sons of Israel camped at Gilgal, and they performed the Passover on day 14 of the month, in the evening, on the plains of Jericho.
\v 11 And they ate from the produce of the land, from the morrow of the Passover, unleavened cakes and roasted {grain}, on that same day.
\v 12 And the manna stopped from the morrow of their eating from the yield of the land, and manna was no longer for the sons of Israel. And they ate from the produce of the land of Canaan in that year.
\p
\v 13 And it happened, in Joshua being by Jericho, that he lifted up his eyes and looked, and behold, a man {was} standing in front of him and his drawn sword {was} in his hand. And Joshua went to him and said to him, “Are you for us or for our enemies?”
\v 14 And he said, “No, but I myself have now come {as} the commander of the army of Yahweh.” And Joshua fell on his face to the earth and bowed down. And he said to him, “What {is} my lord speaking to his servant?”
\v 15 And the commander of the army of Yahweh said to Joshua, “Slip off your sandal from upon your foot, because the place that you are standing on, it {is} holy.” And Joshua did so.

\c 6
\p
\v 1 Now Jericho {was} shutting and {was} being shut up from the face of the sons of Israel. There was no going out and there was no coming in.
\v 2 And Yahweh said to Joshua, “See, I have given Jericho into your hand, and its king, the warriors of valor.
\v 3 And you shall circle the city, all of the men of war, circling the city one time. Thus you shall do six days.
\v 4 And seven priests shall carry seven shofars of rams to the face of the Box. And on the seventh day you shall circle the city seven times, and the priests shall blow on the shofars.
\v 5 And it will happen, when they make a long blast with the horn of the ram, as soon as you hear the sound of the shofar, all of the people shall shout a great shout. And the wall of the city will fall under itself and the people shall go up, a man in front of him.”
\p
\v 6 So Joshua, the son of Nun, called to the priests and said to them, “Carry the Box of the Covenant, and seven priests shall carry seven shofars of rams to the face of the Box of Yahweh.”
\v 7 And he said to the people, “Pass over and circle the city, and the armed {ones} will pass over to the face of the Box of Yahweh.”
\v 8 And it happened, when Joshua had spoken to the people, that seven priests carrying seven shofars of rams to the face of Yahweh passed over and blew on the shofars. And the Box of the Covenant of Yahweh was going behind them.
\v 9 And the armed {ones} {were} walking to the face of the priests blowing the shofars. And the rearguard {was} walking behind the Box, walking and blowing on the shofars.
\v 10 And Joshua commanded the people, saying, “You shall not shout, and you shall not make your voice heard, and a word shall not go out from your mouth until the day I say to you, ‘Shout!’ Then you shall shout.”
\v 11 And he made the Box of Yahweh circle the city, circling one time. Then they entered the camp, and they lodged in the camp.
\p
\v 12 And Joshua got up early in the morning, and the priests carried the Box of Yahweh.
\v 13 And the seven priests carrying the seven shofars of rams to the face of the Box of Yahweh walking, {were} walking, and they blew on the shofars. And the armed {ones} {were} walking to their faces, and the rearguard {was} walking behind the Box of Yahweh, walking and blowing on the shofars.
\v 14 And they circled the city one time on the second day, and they returned {to} the camp. Thus they did six days.
\p
\v 15 And it happened on the seventh day that they got up early, as soon as the dawn had risen, and they circled the city according to this manner seven times. Only on that day they circled the city seven times.
\v 16 And it happened that on the seventh time, the priests blew on the shofars. And Joshua said to the people, “Shout, for Yahweh has given the city to you!
\v 17 And the city is a devoted thing, it and all that {is} in it, for Yahweh. Only Rahab the prostitute will live, she and all who {are} with her in the house, because she hid the messengers whom we sent.
\v 18 But only you, keep yourselves from a devoted thing, lest you are devoting and you take from the devoted thing and you make the camp of Israel into a devoted thing and trouble it.
\v 19 And all of the silver and gold and objects of bronze and iron, it is a holy thing for Yahweh. It shall enter the storehouse of Yahweh.”
\v 20 And the people shouted, and they blew on the shofars. And it happened, when the people heard the sound of the shofar and the people shouted a great shout, that the wall fell under itself, and the people went up to the city, a man in front of him, and they captured the city.
\v 21 And they devoted all that {was} in the city, from man and to woman, from young and to old, and to ox and sheep and donkey, to the mouth of the sword.
\p
\v 22 And Joshua said to the two men having spied out the land, “Enter the house of the woman, the prostitute, and bring out from there the woman and all who {are} to her, just as you swore to her.”
\v 23 And the young men having spied entered and brought out Rahab and her father and her mother and her brothers and all who {were} to her. And they brought out all of her relatives and put them outside the camp of Israel.
\v 24 And they burned with fire the city and all that {was} in it. Only the silver and the gold and the objects of bronze and iron, they put {in} the storehouse of the house of Yahweh.
\v 25 And Joshua kept alive Rahab the prostitute and the house of her father and all who {were} to her. And she has dwelt in the midst of Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers whom Joshua had sent to spy on Jericho.
\p
\v 26 And Joshua made {them} swear at that time, saying, “Cursed {is} the man to the face of Yahweh who arises and builds this city, Jericho. With his firstborn he will found it, and with his youngest he will set up its gates.”
\v 27 And Yahweh was with Joshua, and the report of him was in all of the land.

\c 7
\p
\v 1 But the sons of Israel treacherously committed a treacherous act regarding a devoted thing. For Achan, the son of Karmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, from the tribe of Judah, took from the devoted thing. And the nose of Yahweh burned against the sons of Israel.
\p
\v 2 Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which {was} near Beth Aven, from the east of Bethel. And he spoke to them, saying, “Go up and spy on the land.” And the men went up and spied on Ai.
\v 3 And they returned to Joshua and said to him, “Do not let all the people go up. About 2, 000 men or about 3, 000 men should go up and strike Ai. Do not make all the people weary there, because they are few.”
\v 4 And about 3, 000 men from the people went up there, and they fled to the face of the men of Ai.
\v 5 And the men of Ai struck down from them about 36 men. And they pursued them from the face of the gate unto the quarries, and they struck them on the slope. And the heart of the people melted and became water.
\p
\v 6 And Joshua tore his garments and fell on his face to the earth to the face of the Box of Yahweh until the evening, he and the elders of Israel. And they made dust go up onto their heads.
\v 7 And Joshua said, “Alas, my Lord Yahweh! Why, bringing across, did you bring this people across the Jordan to give us into the hand of the Amorite, to make us perish? And if only we had been content and had stayed on the other side of the Jordan!
\v 8 Please, my Lord! What shall I say, now that Israel has turned the back of the neck to the face of its enemies?
\v 9 And the Canaanite and all the dwellers of the land will hear, and they will surround us and cut off our name from the earth. And what will you do for your great name?”
\p
\v 10 And Yahweh said to Joshua, “Get yourself up! Why is this, you {are} falling on your face?
\v 11 Israel has sinned and indeed transgressed my covenant, which I commanded them, and has indeed taken from the devoted thing and has indeed stolen and also deceived and also placed {it} among their things.
\v 12 So the sons of Israel were not able to stand to the face of their enemies. They turned the back of the neck to the face of their enemies because they have become a devoted thing. I will not resume to be with you if you do not destroy the devoted thing from your midst.
\v 13 Arise! Consecrate the people and say, ‘Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, because thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, “A devoted thing is in your midst, Israel. You will not be able to stand to the face of your enemies until you remove the devoted thing from your midst.”
\v 14 And you shall be brought near in the morning by your tribes. And it will happen, the tribe that Yahweh takes shall come near by clans, and the clan that Yahweh takes shall come near by houses, and the house that Yahweh takes shall come near by men.
\v 15 And it will happen, the one taken with the devoted thing shall be burned with fire, he and all that {is} to him, because he has transgressed the covenant of Yahweh, and because he has done a disgraceful thing in Israel.’”
\p
\v 16 And Joshua got up early in the morning and brought Israel near by its tribes, and the tribe of Judah was taken.
\v 17 And he brought near the clans of Judah, and the clan of the Zerahite was taken. And he brought near the clan of the Zerahite by men, and Zabdi was taken.
\v 18 And he brought near his house by men, and Achan, the son of Karmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, from the tribe of Judah, was taken.
\v 19 And Joshua said to Achan, “My son, please give glory to Yahweh, the God of Israel, and make confession to him. And declare to me please what you have done. Do not hide {it} from me.”
\v 20 And Achan answered Joshua and said, “Truly, I have sinned against Yahweh, the God of Israel. And like this and like this I did:
\v 21 Now I saw among the spoil one good coat of Shinar and 200 shekels of silver and one wedge of gold, 50 shekels {was} its weight. And I desired them and took them. And behold, they are hidden in the earth in the midst of my tent, and the silver {is} under it.”
\p
\v 22 And Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent. And behold, {it} was hidden in his tent, and the silver {was} under it.
\v 23 And they took them from the midst of the tent and brought them to Joshua and to all of the sons of Israel. And they poured them out to the face of Yahweh.
\v 24 And Joshua took Achan, the son of Zerah, and the silver and the coat and the wedge of gold and his sons and his daughters and his ox and his donkey and his flock and his tent and all that {was} to him, and all Israel with him. And they brought them up to the Valley of Achor.
\v 25 And Joshua said, “Why have you troubled us? Yahweh will trouble you on this day.” And all of Israel stoned him with stone. And they burned them with fire, and they stoned them with stones.
\v 26 And they raised up over him a great pile of stones, to this day. And Yahweh turned from the burning of his nose. Therefore the name of that place is called the Valley of Achor to this day.

\c 8
\p
\v 1 And Yahweh said to Joshua, “Do not fear and do not be dismayed. Take with you all of the people of war and arise, go up to Ai. See, I have given into your hand the king of Ai and his people and his city and his land.
\v 2 And you shall do to Ai and its king just as you did to Jericho and its king, except you may plunder its spoil and its livestock for yourselves. Set for yourselves an ambush against the city from behind it.”
\p
\v 3 And Joshua and all of the people of war arose to go up to Ai. And Joshua chose 30, 000 men, warriors of valor, and sent them at night.
\v 4 And he commanded them, saying, “See, you will be lying in ambush against the city from behind the city. You shall not be very far from the city. And all of you shall be prepared.
\v 5 As I and all of the people who {are} with me, we will go near to the city. And it will happen, when they come out to meet us just as at the first, that we will flee to their faces.
\v 6 And they will come out after us until we have drawn them from the city. For they will say, ‘They are fleeing to our faces, just as at the first.’ And we will flee to their faces.
\v 7 And you shall rise from the ambush and possess the city. And Yahweh your God will give it into your hand.
\v 8 And it will happen that when you capture the city, you shall burn the city with fire. You shall do according to the word of Yahweh. See, I have commanded you.”
\v 9 And Joshua sent them, and they went to the ambush place, and they stayed between Bethel and between Ai, from the west of Ai. And Joshua lodged during that night in the midst of the people.
\v 10 And Joshua got up early in the morning and mustered the people. And he and the elders of Israel went up to the face of the people to Ai.
\v 11 And all of the people of war who {were} with him went up and approached and came before the city. And they camped from north of Ai, and the valley was between them and between Ai.
\v 12 And he had taken about 5, 000 men, and he had set them {in} ambush between Bethel and between Ai, from the west of the city.
\v 13 So the people set all of the camp that {was} from the north of the city and its heel from the west of the city. And Joshua went during that night into the midst of the valley.
\p
\v 14 And it happened, as soon as the king of Ai saw, that the men of the city hurried and got up early and went out to meet Israel for battle, he and all his people, at an appointed place to the face of the Arabah. Now he did not know that an ambush {was} against him from behind the city.
\v 15 And Joshua and all of Israel were struck to the face of them, and they fled {by} the way of the wilderness.
\v 16 And all of the people who {were} in the city were summoned to pursue after them, and they pursued after Joshua, and they were drawn away from the city.
\v 17 And a man was not left in Ai or Bethel who had not gone out after Israel. And they left the city opened, and they pursued after Israel.
\p
\v 18 And Yahweh said to Joshua, “Stretch out with the curved sword that is in your hand toward Ai, because I will give it into your hand.” And Joshua stretched out with the curved sword that was in his hand toward the city.
\v 19 And the ambush rose quickly from its place, and they ran when he stretched out his hand. And they entered the city and captured it and hurried and burned the city with fire.
\v 20 And the men of Ai turned behind them and looked, and behold, the smoke of the city went up to the heavens! And it was not in their hands to flee here or there, for the people having fled {to} the wilderness turned themselves toward the pursuers.
\v 21 For Joshua and all of Israel saw that the ambush had captured the city and that the smoke of the city went up, and they turned and struck the men of Ai.
\v 22 And these came out from the city to meet them, so they were in the midst of Israel, these from here and these from there. And they struck them until he left to him no survivor or fugitive.
\v 23 And they seized the king of Ai alive, and they brought him to Joshua.
\p
\v 24 And it happened, when Israel had made an end of slaying all of the dwellers of Ai in the field, in the wilderness in which they pursued them, and all of them had fallen to the mouth of the sword unto their ceasing, that all of Israel returned to Ai and struck it to the mouth of the sword.
\v 25 And it happened that all of the ones falling on that day, from man and unto woman, were 12, 000, all of the men of Ai.
\v 26 And Joshua did not turn back his hand that he had stretched out with the curved sword, until when he had devoted all of the dwellers of Ai.
\v 27 However, Israel plundered for themselves the livestock and the spoil of that city, according to the word of Yahweh, which he had commanded Joshua.
\v 28 And Joshua burned Ai, and he made it a mound forever, a desolation to this day.
\v 29 And he hanged the king of Ai on a tree until the time of the evening. And as the sun was going, Joshua commanded, and they brought down his corpse from the tree, and they threw it at the opening of the gate of the city, and they raised over it a great pile of stones, to this day.
\p
\v 30 Then Joshua built an altar to Yahweh, the God of Israel, on Mount Ebal,
\v 31 just as Moses, the servant of Yahweh, had commanded the sons of Israel, as written in the Book of the Law of Moses, “An altar of whole stones, over which one has not wielded an iron tool.” And they offered on it burnt offerings to Yahweh, and they sacrificed peace offerings.
\v 32 And there on the stones he wrote a copy of the law of Moses, which he wrote to the face of the sons of Israel.
\v 33 And all of Israel and its elders and officers and its judges {were} standing from here and from there at the Box, in front of the priests, the Levites, the carriers of the Box of the Covenant of Yahweh, as the sojourner, so the native, half of him toward the front of Mount Gerizim and half of him toward the front of Mount Ebal, just as Moses, the servant of Yahweh, had commanded to bless the people of Israel at the first.
\v 34 And afterward, he read all of the words of the law, the blessings and the curses, according to everything written in the book of the law.
\v 35 There was not a word from all that Moses had commanded that Joshua did not read in front of all of the assembly of Israel, and the women, and the children, and the sojourners going in the midst of them.

\c 9
\p
\v 1 And it happened, when all of the kings heard who {were} on the other side of the Jordan, in the hill country and in the lowlands and in all of the coast of the Great Sea toward the front of Lebanon, the Hittite and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite,
\v 2 that they gathered themselves together as one mouth to fight against Joshua and against Israel.
\p
\v 3 But the dwellers of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to Ai.
\v 4 And they acted, they also, with cunning. And they went and acted as envoys and took worn-out sacks for their donkeys and worn-out and torn and mended skins of wine,
\v 5 and worn-out and patched sandals {were} on their feet, and worn-out garments {were} on them, and all of the bread of their provisions was dry, it had become crumbs.
\v 6 And they went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal and they said to him and to a man of Israel, “We have come from a distant land, and now, cut a covenant with us.”
\v 7 And a man of Israel said to the Hivite, “Perhaps you {are} dwelling among us. Then how can I cut a covenant with you?”
\v 8 And they said to Joshua, “We {are} your servants.” And Joshua said to them, “Who are you, and where have you come from?”
\v 9 And they said to him, “Your servants have come from a very distant land because of the name of Yahweh your God. For we have heard a report of him and all that he did in Egypt
\v 10 and all that he did to the two kings of the Amorite who were on the other side of the Jordan, to Sihon the king of Heshbon and to Og the king of Bashan who {was} in Ashtaroth.
\v 11 And our elders and all the dwellers of our land spoke to us, saying, ‘Take provisions in your hand for the road and go to meet them. And you shall say to them, “We are your servants. And now, cut a covenant for us.”’
\v 12 This bread of ours, we took it as provision hot from our houses on the day of our going out to come to you. And now, behold, it is dry and has become crumbs.
\v 13 And these skins of wine that we filled {were} new, and behold, they have broken open. And these garments of ours and sandals of ours are worn-out from the very great length of the road.”
\v 14 And the men took from their provisions, but they did not ask the mouth of Yahweh.
\v 15 And Joshua made peace with them, and he cut a covenant with them to let them live. And the leaders of the congregation swore to them.
\p
\v 16 And it happened at the end of three days, after when they had cut a covenant with them, that they heard that they {were} near to them and they {were} dwelling among them.
\v 17 And the sons of Israel set out and came to their cities on the third day. And their cities {were} Gibeon and Kephirah and Beeroth and Kiriath Jearim.
\v 18 And the sons of Israel did not strike them, because the leaders of the congregation had sworn to them by Yahweh, the God of Israel. And all of the congregation murmured against the leaders.
\v 19 But all of the leaders said to all of the congregation, “We, we have sworn to them by Yahweh the God of Israel, so now we are not able to touch them.
\v 20 We will do this to them and let them live so wrath will not be on us because of the oath that we swore to them.”
\v 21 Then the leaders said to them, “Let them live.” So they became hewers of wood and drawers of water for all of the congregation, just as the leaders had spoken to them.
\p
\v 22 And Joshua called for them and spoke to them, saying, “Why have you deceived us, saying, ‘We {are} very far from you,’ but you {are} dwelling among us?
\v 23 And now you are cursed, and none of you shall be cut off a slave and hewers of wood and drawers of water for the house of my God.”
\v 24 And they answered Joshua and said, “Because declaring, it was declared to your servants that Yahweh your God commanded Moses his servant to give all of the land to you and to destroy all of the dwellers of the land from your faces. And we were very afraid for our lives from your faces, so we did this thing.
\v 25 And now, behold us, in your hand. Do to us as {is} good and as {is} right in your eyes to do.”
\v 26 And he did thus to them. And he delivered them from the hand of the sons of Israel, and they did not slay them.
\v 27 But on that day Joshua made them hewers of wood and drawers of water for the congregation and for the altar of Yahweh, to this day, in the place that he would choose.

\c 10
\p
\v 1 And it happened, when Adoni Zedek, the king of Jerusalem, heard that Joshua had captured Ai and had devoted it, just as he had done to Jericho and to its king, thus he had done to Ai and to its king, and that the dwellers of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and {were} in their midst,
\v 2 that they feared greatly, because Gibeon {was} a great city, like one of the cities of the kingdom, and because it {was} greater than Ai, and all of its men {were} warriors.
\v 3 And Adoni Zedek, the king of Jerusalem, sent to Hoham, the king of Hebron, and to Piram, the king of Jarmuth, and to Japhia, the king of Lachish, and to Debir, the king of Eglon, saying,
\v 4 “Come up to me and help me, and let us strike Gibeon, because it has made peace with Joshua and with the sons of Israel.”
\v 5 And the five of the kings of the Amorite gathered and went up, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon, they and all of their camps. And they camped against Gibeon and fought against it.
\v 6 And the men of Gibeon sent to Joshua at the camp at Gilgal, saying, “Do not let your hands drop from your servants. Come up to us quickly and save us and help us, because all of the kings of the Amorite dwelling {in} the hill country have gathered against us.”
\v 7 And Joshua went up from Gilgal, he and all of the people of war with him, and all of the warriors of valor.
\v 8 And Yahweh said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid of them, because I have given them into your hand. Not a man from them will stand at your face.”
\v 9 And Joshua came to them suddenly, all of the night he went up from Gilgal.
\v 10 And Yahweh panicked them to the face of Israel, and he struck them {with} a great striking at Gibeon, and he pursued them {by} the way of the ascent of Beth Horon, and he struck them unto Azekah and unto Makkedah.
\v 11 And it happened, in their fleeing from the face of Israel, they {were} on the descent of Beth Horon, that Yahweh threw on them great stones from the heavens unto Azekah, and they died. {There were} more who died by the stones of the hail than those whom the sons of Israel killed with the sword.
\v 12 Then Joshua spoke to Yahweh in the day of Yahweh giving the Amorite to the face of the sons of Israel, and he said to the eyes of Israel, “Sun, be still over Gibeon, and moon, over the Valley of Aijalon.”
\v 13 And the sun was still, and the moon stood, until the nation avenged its enemies. Is it not written in the Book of Jashar? And the sun stood in the middle of the heavens, and it did not hurry to go {down}, about a whole day.
\v 14 And none has been like that day to the face of it or after it, for Yahweh listening to the voice of a man, because Yahweh fought for Israel.
\v 15 And Joshua and all of Israel with him returned to the camp at Gilgal.
\v 16 And these five kings had fled and hidden themselves in the cave at Makkedah.
\v 17 And it was told to Joshua, saying, “The five kings have been found hiding themselves in the cave at Makkedah.”
\v 18 And Joshua said, “Roll great stones to the mouth of the cave and appoint men by it to guard them.”
\v 19 But you, do not stand! Pursue after your enemies and attack their rear. Do not let them enter into their cities, because Yahweh your God has given them into your hand.
\v 20 And it happened, when Joshua and the sons of Israel had finished striking them {with} a very great striking until their finishing, that the survivors from them survived and entered into the cities of fortification.
\v 21 And all of the people returned to the camp, to Joshua at Makkedah, in peace. No one sharpened his tongue against the sons of Israel, against a man.
\v 22 And Joshua said, “Open the mouth of the cave and bring out to me these five kings from the cave.”
\v 23 And they did so and brought out to him these five kings from the cave: the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, the king of Eglon.
\v 24 And it happened, when they brought out these kings to Joshua, that Joshua called to every man of Israel and said to the commanders of the men of war, the ones going with him, “Come near, put your feet on the necks of these kings.” So they came near and put their feet on their necks.
\v 25 And Joshua said to them, “Do not be afraid and do not be dismayed. Be strong and be courageous, because Yahweh will do thus to all of your enemies with whom you {are} fighting.”
\v 26 And after this Joshua struck them and killed them and hanged them on five trees. And they were hanging on the trees until the evening.
\v 27 And it happened at the time of the going {down} of the sun that Joshua commanded, and they took them down from upon the trees and threw them into the cave where they had hidden themselves. And they put great stones over the mouth of the cave, to this same day.
\v 28 And Joshua captured Makkedah on that day and struck it and its king to the mouth of the sword. He devoted them and every soul that {was} in it. He did not leave a survivor. So he did to the king of Makkedah just as he had done to the king of Jericho.
\v 29 And Joshua and all of Israel with him passed over from Makkedah to Libnah, and he fought with Libnah.
\v 30 And Yahweh also gave it and its king into the hand of Israel. And he struck it and every soul that {was} in it to the mouth of the sword. He did not leave a survivor in it. So he did to its king just as he had done to the king of Jericho.
\v 31 And Joshua and all of Israel with him passed over from Libnah to Lachish, and he camped against it and fought with it.
\v 32 And Yahweh gave Lachish into the hand of Israel, and he captured it on the second day and struck it and every soul that {was} in it to the mouth of the sword, according to all that he had done to Libnah.
\v 33 Then Horam, the king of Gezer, went up to help Lachish, and Joshua struck him and his people until he did not leave to him a survivor.
\v 34 And Joshua and all of Israel with him passed over from Lachish to Eglon, and they camped against it and fought with it.
\v 35 And they captured it on that day and struck it to the mouth of the sword, and every soul that {was} in it on that day he devoted, according to all that he had done to Lachish.
\v 36 And Joshua and all of Israel with him went up from Eglon to Hebron, and they fought with it.
\v 37 And they captured it and struck it and its king and all of its cities and every soul that {was} in it to the mouth of the sword. He did not leave a survivor, according to all that he had done to Eglon. And he devoted it and every soul that {was} in it.
\v 38 And Joshua and all of Israel with him returned to Debir, and he fought with it.
\v 39 And he captured it and its king and all of its cities, and they struck them to the mouth of the sword and devoted every soul that {was} in it. He did not leave a survivor. Just as he had done to Hebron, thus he did to Debir and to its king, and just as he had done to Libnah and to its king.
\v 40 And Joshua struck all of the land, the hill country and the Negev and the lowland and the slopes, and all of their kings. He did not leave a survivor. And he devoted every breathing thing, just as Yahweh, the God of Israel, had commanded.
\v 41 And Joshua struck them from Kadesh Barnea and unto Gaza, and all of the land of Goshen and unto Gibeon.
\v 42 And Joshua captured all of these kings and their land at one time, because Yahweh, the God of Israel, fought for Israel.
\v 43 And Joshua and all of Israel with him returned to the camp at Gilgal.

\v 1 Now these {are} the kings of the land whom the sons of Israel struck and possessed their land on the other side of the Jordan, from the rising of the sun, from the wadi of Arnon unto Mount Hermon, and all of the Arabah from the sunrise:
\q \v 2 Sihon, the king of the Amorite, the one dwelling in Heshbon, ruling from Aroer, which {is} on the lip of the wadi of Arnon, and the middle of the wadi and half of Gilead and unto the Jabbok wadi, the border of the sons of Ammon,

\ts\*
\q \v 3 and the Arabah unto the Sea of Kinnereth from the sunrise and unto the Sea of the Arabah, the Sea of Salt, toward the sunrise, the way of Beth Jeshimoth and from the south below the slopes of Pisgah.
\ts\*
\q \v 4 And the border of Og, the king of Bashan, from the remnant of the Raphaites, the one dwelling in Ashtaroth and in Edrei
\v 5 and ruling in Mount Hermon, and in Salekah, and in all of Bashan unto the border of the Geshurite and the Maacathite, and half of Gilead, the border of Sihon, the king of Heshbon.
\v 6 Moses, the servant of Yahweh, and the sons of Israel had struck them, and Moses the servant of Yahweh had given it {as} a possession to the Reubenite and to the Gadite and to half of the tribe of Manasseh.

\ts\*
\p
\v 7 Now these {are} the kings of the land whom Joshua and the sons of Israel struck on the other side of the Jordan, toward the sea, from Baal Gad in the valley of the Lebanon and unto Mount Halak, the one ascending to Seir. And Joshua gave it to the tribes of Israel {as} a possession according to their divisions,
\v 8 in the hill country, and in the lowland, and in the Arabah, and on the slopes, and in the wilderness, and in the Negev—the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite:

\ts\*
\v 9 the king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which {is} from the side of Bethel, one;
\v 10 the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;
\v 11 the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;
\v 12 the king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;

\v 13 the king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;

\v 24 the king of Tirzah, one. All of the kings {were} 31.

\v 1 Now Joshua had aged, he had come into days. And Yahweh said to him, “You have aged, you have come into days, and very much land remains to possess it.
\v 2 This {is} the remaining land: all of the territories of the Philistines, and all of the Geshurite,
\v 3 from Shihor, which {is} at the face of Egypt, and unto the border of Ekron northward (it shall be reckoned to the Canaanite); the five lords of the Philistines: the Gazite and the Ashdodite, the Ashkelonite, the Gathite, and the Ekronite; and the Avvites

\ts\*
\v 4 from the south; all of the land of the Canaanite, and Mearah, which {is} to the Sidonians, unto Aphek, unto the border of the Amorite;
\v 5 and the land of the Gebalite; and all of Lebanon from the rising of the sun, from Baal Gad below Mount Hermon unto Lebo Hamath.

\ts\*
\v 6 All of the dwellers of the hill country, from Lebanon unto Misrephoth Maim, all of the Sidonians, I myself will dispossess them from the face of the sons of Israel. You shall only cause it to fall to Israel as an inheritance, just as I have commanded you.
\v 7 And now divide this land as an inheritance to the nine tribes and half of the tribe of Manasseh.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 8 With him the Reubenite and the Gadite had taken their inheritance that Moses had given to them on the other side of the Jordan, toward the sunrise, just as Moses, the servant of Yahweh, had given to them:
\v 9 from Aroer, which is on the lip of the wadi of Arnon, and the city that {is} in the middle of the wadi, and all of the plateau of Medeba unto Dibon;

\ts\*
\v 10 and all of the cities of Sihon, the king of the Amorite, who reigned in Heshbon, unto the border of the sons of Ammon;
\v 11 and Gilead, and the border of the Geshurite and the Maakathite, and all of Mount Hermon, and all of Bashan unto Salekah,
\v 12 all of the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei. (He remained from the remnant of the Raphaites.) And Moses struck them and dispossessed them.

\ts\*
\v 13 But the sons of Israel did not dispossess the Geshurite and the Maacathite. And Geshur and Maacath dwell in the midst of Israel to this day.
\v 14 Only he did not give an inheritance to the tribe of Levi. The burnt offerings of Yahweh, the God of Israel, they are his inheritance, just as he spoke to him.

\ts\*
\p
\v 15 And Moses gave to the tribe of the sons of Reuben according to their clans.
\v 16 And the border for them was from Aroer, which {is} on the lip of the wadi of Arnon, and the city that {is} in the middle of the wadi, and all of the plateau beside Medeba,

\ts\*
\v 17 Heshbon and all of its cities that {are} in the plateau, Dibon and Bamoth Baal and Beth Baal Meon
\v 18 and Jahaz and Kedemoth and Mephaath
\v 19 and Kiriathai and Sibmah and Zereth Shahar on the hill of the valley

\ts\*
\v 20 and Beth Peor and the slopes of Pisgah and Beth Jeshimoth
\v 21 and all of the cities of the plateau, and all of the kingdom of Sihon, the king of the Amorite, who had reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses struck, him and the leaders of Midian: Evi and Rekem and Zur and Hur and Reba, the princes of Sihon, the dwellers of the land.

\ts\*
\v 22 And the sons of Israel slew with the sword Balaam, the son of Beor, the diviner, with the slain.
\v 23 And the border of the sons of Reuben was the Jordan and its border. This {is} the inheritance of the sons of Reuben according to their clans, the cities, and their villages.

\ts\*
\p
\v 24 And Moses gave to the tribe of Gad, to the sons of Gad according to their clans.
\v 25 And the border for them was Jazer and all of the cities of Gilead and half of the land of the sons of Ammon, unto Aroer, which {is} at the face of Rabbah,
\v 26 and from Heshbon unto Ramath Mizpah and Betonim, and from Mahanaim unto the border of Debir,

\ts\*
\v 27 and in the valley, Beth Haram and Beth Nimrah and Succoth and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon, the king of Heshbon, the Jordan and the border, unto the end of the Sea of Kinnereth, beyond the Jordan from the sunrise.
\v 28 This is the inheritance of the sons of Gad according to their clans, the cities and their villages.

\ts\*
\p
\v 29 And Moses gave to half of the tribe of Manasseh, and it was to half of the tribe of the sons of Manasseh according to their clans.
\v 30 And their border was from Mahanaim, all of Bashan, all of the kingdom of Og, the king of Bashan, and all of the towns of Jair, which {are} in Bashan, 60 cities.
\ts\*
\v 31 And half of Gilead, and Ashtaroth and Edrei (the cities of the kingdom of Og in the Bashan), were to the sons of Machir the son of Manasseh, for half of the sons of Machir according to their clans.
\v 32 These {are} what Moses caused to inherit in the plains of Moab, from the other side of the Jordan, Jericho from the sunrise.
\ts\*
\p
\v 33 But to the tribe of Levi Moses gave no inheritance. Yahweh, the God of Israel, he {is} their inheritance, just as he spoke to them.


\ts\*

\c 14
\p
\v 1 Now these {are} what the sons of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest and Joshua, the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the sons of Israel caused them to inherit.
\v 2 Their inheritance {was} by lot, just as Yahweh had commanded by the hand of Moses, for the nine tribes and the half of a tribe.
\ts\*
\v 3 For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and half of a tribe from the other side of the Jordan. But to the Levites he did not give an inheritance in the midst of them.
\v 4 For the sons of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim. And they gave no portion to the Levites in the land if not cities for dwelling and their pasturelands for their livestock and for their property.
\v 5 Just as Yahweh had commanded Moses, so the sons of Israel did. And they divided the land.

\ts\*
\p
\v 6 And the sons of Judah came near to Joshua at Gilgal, and Caleb, the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, said to him, “You yourself know the word that Yahweh spoke to Moses, the man of God, concerning me and concerning you at Kadesh Barnea.
\v 7 I {was} a son of 40 years when Moses, the servant of Yahweh, sent me from Kadesh Barnea to spy on the land. And I brought back word to him just as {was} in my heart.

\ts\*
\v 8 But my brothers who went up with me made the heart of the people melt. But I myself was full after Yahweh my God.
\v 9 And Moses swore on that day, saying, ‘If the land on which your foot has trodden will not be for an inheritance for you and for your sons unto forever, for you were full after Yahweh my God.’

\ts\*
\v 10 And now, behold, Yahweh has kept me alive these 45 years, just as he spoke, from when Yahweh spoke this word to Moses when Israel walked in the wilderness. And now, behold, today I am a son of 85 years.
\v 11 Still I {am} strong today just as on the day Moses sent me. As {was} my strength then, so {is} my strength now, for war, and for going out and for coming in.
\v 12 And now, give to me this hill country that Yahweh spoke {of} on that day. For you yourself heard on that day that the Anakites {were} there and great fortified cities. Perhaps Yahweh {will be} with me and I will dispossess them, just as Yahweh has spoken.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 13 And Joshua blessed him, and he gave Hebron to Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, for an inheritance.
\v 14 Therefore Hebron is to Caleb, the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, for an inheritance to this day, because he was full after Yahweh, the God of Israel.
\v 15 (Now the name of Hebron formerly {was} Kiriath Arba. He {was} a great man among the Anakites.) And the land rested from war.


\ts\*

\c 15
\p
\v 1 Now the lot for the tribe of the sons of Judah according to their clans was to the border of Edom, from the wilderness of Zin southward from the end of the south.
\v 2 And the border of the south for them was from the end of the Sea of Salt, from the tongue turning southward.

\ts\*
\v 3 And it went out to the south to the Ascent of Akrabbim, then it passed over to Zin, then it went up from the south to Kadesh Barnea, then it passed over to Hezron, then it went up to Addar, then it curved around to Karka.
\v 4 And it passed over to Azmon, then it went out {to} the wadi of Egypt, and the goings out of the border {were} seaward. This will be for you the border of the south.

\ts\*
\v 5 And the border eastward {was} the Sea of Salt unto the end of the Jordan. And the border to the side of northward {was} from the tongue of the sea at the end of the Jordan.
\v 6 And the border went up to Beth Hoglah and passed over from the north to Beth Arabah. Then the border went up to the stone of Bohan, the son of Reuben.

\v 7 Then the border went up to Debir from the Valley of Achor and, turning northward, to Gilgal, which {is} in front of the ascent of Adummim, which {is} from the south of the wadi. Then the border passed over to the waters of En Shemesh, and its goings out were at En Rogel.
\v 8 And the border went up the valley of Ben Hinnom to the shoulder of the Jebusite from the south (it is Jerusalem). And the border went up to the head of the hill that {is} on the face of the valley of Hinnom, seaward, which {is} at the end of the valley of the Raphaites northward.

\v 9 And the border turned from the head of the hill to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah, and it went out to the cities of Mount Ephron. Then the border turned to Baalah (it is Kiriath Jearim).

\v 13 And to Caleb, the son of Jephunneh, he gave a portion in the midst of the sons of Judah according to the mouth of Yahweh to Joshua: Kiriath Arba (the father of the Anak, it {is} Hebron).

\v 15 And he went up from there against the dwellers of Debir. (Now the name of Debir {was} formerly Kiriath Sepher.)

\ts\*
\v 16 And Caleb said, “Whoever strikes Kiriath Sepher and captures it, I will give my daughter Aksah to him for a wife.”
\v 17 And Othniel, the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, captured it. So he gave his daughter Achsah to him for a wife.

\ts\*
\v 18 Now it happened, in the coming of her, that she persuaded him to request the field from her father. And she descended from upon the donkey, and Caleb said to her, “What for you?”

\v 1 Now the lot for the sons of Joseph went out from the Jordan {at} Jericho, to the waters of Jericho from the sunrise, going up {through} the wilderness from Jericho into the hill country of Bethel.
\v 2 And it went out from Bethel to Luz and passed over to the border of the Arkites at Ataroth.
\v 3 Then it went down to the west to the border of the Japhletite, unto the border of Lower Beth Horon and unto Gezer, and its goings out were seaward.

\ts\*
\p
\v 4 And the sons of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, inherited.
\v 5 Now this was the border of the sons of Ephraim according to their clans. And the border of their inheritance from the sunrise was Ataroth Addar unto Upper Beth Horon,
\v 6 And the border went out toward the sea {to} Mikmethath from the north, and the border curved from the sunrise {at} Taanath Shiloh and passed it from the sunrise to Janoah.
\v 7 And it went down from Janoah {to} Ataroth and Naarah and reached Jericho and came out {at} the Jordan.

\ts\*
\v 8 From Tappuah, the border went seaward {to} the wadi of Kanah, and its goings out were seaward. This {was} the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Ephraim according to their clans.
\v 9 And cities set apart for the sons of Ephraim {were} in the midst of the inheritance of the sons of Manasseh, all of the cities and their villages.
\v 10 But they did not dispossess the Canaanite, the dweller of Gezer, so the Canaanite has dwelled within Ephraim to this day, but he has become a serving forced laborer.


\ts\*

\c 17
\p
\v 1 And a lot was for the tribe of Manasseh. (Now he was the firstborn of Joseph.) For Machir, the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, because he was a man of war, so to him were Gilead and Bashan.
\v 2 And it was for the remaining sons of Manasseh, according to their clans, for the sons of Abiezer and for the sons of Helek and for the sons of Asriel and for the sons of Shechem and for the sons of Hepher and for the sons of Shemida. These {were} the sons of Manasseh, the son of Joseph, the males according to their clans.

\ts\*
\v 3 Now regarding Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, no sons were to him, if not daughters. And these {were} the names of his daughters: Mahlah and Noah, Hoglah, Milkah and Tirzah.
\v 4 And they came near to the face of Eleazar the priest, and to the face of Joshua the son of Nun, and to the face of the leaders, saying, “Yahweh commanded Moses to give to us an inheritance in the midst of our brothers.” And he gave to them according to the mouth of Yahweh an inheritance in the midst of the brothers of their father.

\ts\*
\v 5 So ten portions of Manasseh fell, apart from the land of Gilead and Bashan, which {were} from the other side of the Jordan.
\v 6 For the daughters of Manasseh inherited an inheritance in the midst of his sons. And the land of the Gilead was for the remaining sons of Manasseh.

\ts\*
\p
\v 7 And the border of Manasseh was from Asher to Mikmethath, which {is} on the face of Shechem. And the border went to the right to the dwellers of En Tappuah.
\v 8 (The land of Tappuah was to Manasseh, but Tappuah at the border of Manasseh {was} to the sons of Ephraim.)

\ts\*
\v 9 And the border went down {to} the wadi of Kanah. Southward of the wadi, these cities {were} to Ephraim, in the midst of the cities of Manasseh. And the border of Manasseh {was} from the north of the wadi, and its goings out were seaward.
\v 10 Southward {was} to Ephraim, and northward {was} to Manasseh, and the sea was its border. And it met with Asher from the north and with Issachar from the sunrise.
\v 11 And to Manasseh in Issachar and in Asher {were} Beth Shan and its daughters and Ibleam and its daughters and the dwellers of Dor and its daughters and the dwellers of En Dor and its daughters and the dwellers of Taanach and its daughters and the dwellers of Megiddo and its daughters, the three of a height.

\ts\*
\v 12 But the sons of Manasseh were not able to possess these cities, for the Canaanite was determined to dwell in this land.
\v 13 Now it happened, when the sons of Israel became strong, that they put the Canaanite to forced labor. But dispossessing, they did not dispossess him.

\ts\*
\p
\v 14 And the sons of Joseph spoke with Joshua, saying, “Why have you given to me {as} an inheritance one lot and one portion, when I {am} a numerous people, since Yahweh has blessed me unto now?”
\v 15 And Joshua said to them, “If you {are} a numerous people, go up for yourself to the forest, and you shall clear for yourself there in the land of the Perizzite and the Raphaites, for the hill country of Ephraim is narrow to you.”

\ts\*
\v 16 But the sons of Joseph said, “The hill country is not enough for us, and a chariot of iron {is} with every Canaanite, the dweller in the land of the valley, to {those} who {are} in Beth Shan and its daughters and to {those} who {are} in the valley of Jezreel.”
\v 17 And Joshua spoke to the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and to Manasseh, saying, “You {are} a numerous people and great power {is} to you. There will not be one lot to you.
\v 18 For the hill country will be to you, though it {is} a forest, and you shall clear it, and its goings out will be to you. For you will dispossess the Canaanite, though a chariot of iron is to him, though he {is} strong.”


\ts\*

\c 18
\p
\v 1 Then all of the congregation of the sons of Israel assembled at Shiloh, and they placed the Tent of Meeting there. And the land was subdued to their face.
\v 2 And seven tribes remained among the sons of Israel {to} which they had not divided their inheritance.

\ts\*
\v 3 And Joshua said to the sons of Israel, “Unto when will you slacken yourselves to enter to possess the land that Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has given to you?
\v 4 Provide for yourselves three men to a tribe. And I will send them, and they shall arise and walk about in the land and write it down according to the mouth of their inheritance, and they shall come to me.

\ts\*
\v 5 And they shall divide it among themselves into seven divisions. Judah will stand on its border from the south, and the house of Joseph will stand on their border from the north.
\v 6 And you shall write down the land {in} seven divisions and bring them to me here. And I will throw a lot for you here to the face of Yahweh our God.
\v 7 But no division {will be} within you for the Levites, because the priesthood of Yahweh {is} their inheritance. And Gad and Reuben and half of the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance from the other side of the Jordan toward the sunrise, which Moses, the servant of Yahweh, gave to them.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 8 And the men arose and went. And Joshua commanded the going ones to write down the land, saying, “Go and walk about in the land and write it down and return to me. And here I will throw a lot for you to the face of Yahweh in Shiloh.”
\v 9 And the men went and passed over in the land, and they wrote it down upon a scroll according to the cities in seven divisions. And they came to Joshua, to the camp {at} Shiloh.
\v 10 And Joshua threw a lot for them in Shiloh to the face of Yahweh. And there Joshua divided the land to the sons of Israel according to their divisions.

\v 4 And he shall flee to one from these cities and stand {at} the entrance of the gate of the city, and he shall speak his words in the ears of the elders of that city. And they shall gather him into the city to themselves, and they shall give to him a place, and he shall dwell with them.

\v 1 Then Joshua called to the Reubenite and to the Gadite and to half of the tribe of Manasseh.
\v 2 And he said to them, “You yourselves have kept all that Moses, the servant of Yahweh, commanded you. And you have listened to my voice according to all that I have commanded you.
\v 3 You have not forsaken your brothers these many days, to this day. but you have kept the keeping of the commandments of Yahweh your God.
\v 4 And now Yahweh your God has given rest to your brothers, just as he spoke to them. And now, turn and go for yourselves to your tents, to the land of your possession, which Moses, the servant of Yahweh, gave to you on the other side of the Jordan.
\v 5 Only watch greatly to do the commandment and the instruction that Moses, the servant of Yahweh, commanded you, to love Yahweh your God and to walk in all of his ways and to keep his commandments and to cling to him, and to serve him with all of your heart and with all of your soul.”
\v 6 And Joshua blessed them. And he sent them away and they went to their tents.
\v 7 Now to the half of the tribe of Manasseh, Moses had given in Bashan, and to half of him, Joshua gave with their brothers on the other side of the Jordan, seaward. And when Joshua sent them away to their tents, then he also blessed them,
\v 8 and he spoke to them, saying, “Return to your tents with many riches and with very much livestock, with silver and with gold and with bronze and with iron and with very many garments. Divide the spoil of your enemies with your brothers.”
\v 9 And the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and half of the tribe of Manasseh turned back and went from with the sons of Israel, from Shiloh, which {is} in the land of Canaan, to go to the land of Gilead, to the land of their possession, on which they had seized for themselves, upon the mouth of Yahweh by the hand of Moses.
\v 10 And they entered into the regions of the Jordan that are in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and half of the tribe of Manasseh built an altar there beside the Jordan, an altar large in appearance.
\v 11 And the sons of Israel heard, saying, “Behold, the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and half of the tribe of Manasseh have built the altar at the front of the land of Canaan, in the regions of the Jordan, on the side of the sons of Israel.”
\v 12 When the sons of Israel heard, then all of the congregation of the sons of Israel gathered themselves at Shiloh to go up against them to war.
\v 13 And the sons of Israel sent Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the priest, into the land of the Gilead to the sons of Reuben and to the sons of Gad and to half of the tribe of Manasseh.
\v 14 And ten leaders {were} with him, one leader, one leader, to the house of the father to all of the tribes of Israel. And they {were} a man, the head of the house of their fathers to the thousands of Israel.
\v 15 And they came into the land of Gilead to the sons of Reuben and to the sons of Gad and to half of the tribe of Manasseh, and they spoke with them, saying,
\v 16 “Thus says all of the congregation of Yahweh: ‘What is this unfaithfulness that you have done unfaithfully against the God of Israel, to turn today from after Yahweh in your building for yourselves an altar today for your rebelling against Yahweh?
\v 17 {Was} the iniquity of Peor little for us, from which we have not purified ourselves to this day? And a plague was among the congregation of Yahweh.
\v 18 And will you yourselves turn today from after Yahweh? And it will happen, {if} you yourselves rebel against Yahweh today, then tomorrow he will be furious toward all of the congregation of Israel.
\v 19 And indeed, if the land of your possession {is} unclean, cross over for yourselves into the land of the possession of Yahweh, where the dwelling of Yahweh dwells there, and possess in the midst of us. But against Yahweh do not rebel, and against us do not rebel, by your building an altar for yourselves apart from the altar of Yahweh our God.
\v 20 {Did} not Achan, the son of Zerah, act unfaithfully in unfaithfulness with the devoted thing, and wrath was on all of the congregation of Israel? And he did not perish, one man, in his iniquity!’”
\v 21 And the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and half of the tribe of Manasseh answered and spoke with the heads of the thousands of Israel:
\v 22 “Yahweh {is} God of gods! Yahweh {is} God of gods! He knows, and Israel, let it know! If in rebellion or if in unfaithfulness against Yahweh, do not save us this day!
\v 23 To build an altar for ourselves to turn from after Yahweh, or if to offer on it burnt offerings or grain offerings, or if to make on it sacrifices of peace offerings, Yahweh himself will seek.
\v 24 But if not from anxiety from a matter we did this, saying, ‘Tomorrow your sons might speak to our sons, saying, “What to you and to Yahweh, the God of Israel?
\v 25 For Yahweh has given a border between us and between you sons of Reuben and sons of Gad, the Jordan. No portion {is} for you in Yahweh.”’ And your sons might make our sons desist, to not fearing Yahweh.
\v 26 So we said, ‘Let us now do to build for ourselves an altar, not for a burnt offering and not for a sacrifice,
\v 27 but it {will be} a witness between us and between you and between our generations after us, to serve the service of Yahweh to his face with our burnt offerings and with our sacrifices and with our peace offerings. And your sons will not say to our sons tomorrow, “No portion {is} for you in Yahweh.”’
\v 28 And we said, ‘And it will happen, if they speak to us, or to our generations tomorrow, that we will say, “See, a copy of the altar of Yahweh that our fathers made, not for a burnt offering and not for a sacrifice, but it {is} a witness between us and between you.”
\v 29 Profane to us from him, to rebel against Yahweh and turn today from after Yahweh to build an altar for a burnt offering, for a grain offering, or for a sacrifice, apart from the altar of Yahweh our God that is to the face of his dwelling!’”
\v 30 And Phinehas the priest and the leaders of the congregation and the heads of the thousands of Israel who {were} with him heard the words that the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the sons of Manasseh spoke. And it was good in their eyes.
\v 31 And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the priest, said to the sons of Reuben and to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Manasseh, “Today we know that Yahweh {is} in the midst of us, that you have not acted unfaithfully in this unfaithfulness against Yahweh. Therefore, you have delivered the sons of Israel from the hand of Yahweh.”
\v 32 And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest, and the leaders returned from with the sons of Reuben and from with the sons of Gad, from the land of Gilead to the land of Canaan, to the sons of Israel. And they brought them a word.
\v 33 And the word was good in the eyes of the sons of Israel. And the sons of Israel blessed God, and they did not speak of going up against them to war to destroy the land in which the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad {were} dwelling.
\v 34 For the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad had called to the altar, “For it {is} a witness between us that Yahweh {is} God.”

\v 1 And it happened from many days afterward, when Yahweh had given rest to Israel from all of their enemies from all around, that Joshua had aged, he had come into days.
\v 2 And Joshua called to all of Israel, to its elders and to its heads and to its judges and to its officers, and he said to them, “I have aged, I have come into days.
\v 3 But you yourselves have seen all that Yahweh your God has done to all of these nations from your faces. For Yahweh your God, he {is} the one having fought for you.
\v 4 See, I have caused to fall for you these remaining nations as an inheritance for your tribes, from the Jordan, and all of the nations that I cut off, and the Great Sea from the going of the sun.
\v 5 And Yahweh your God, he will push them from your face, and he will dispossess them from to your face. And you will possess their land, just as Yahweh your God has spoken to you.
\v 6 And you shall be very strong to keep and to do everything written in the book of the instruction of Moses, not to turn aside from it right or left,
\v 7 not to come among these nations, these ones remaining with you. And by the name of their gods you shall not invoke and you shall not swear, and you shall not serve them and you shall not bow down to them.
\v 8 If not to Yahweh your God you shall cling, just as you have done to this day.
\v 9 And Yahweh has dispossessed great and powerful nations from your faces. And you, a man has not stood against your faces to this day.
\v 10 One man from you pursues a thousand, for Yahweh your God, he is the one fighting for you, just as he has spoken to you.
\v 11 And you shall keep yourselves exceedingly to yourselves, to love Yahweh your God.
\v 12 For if turning, you turn and cling to the remnant of these nations, these ones remaining with you, and you intermarry with them and you go among them and they among you,
\v 13 knowing, may you know that Yahweh your God will not continue to dispossess these nations from to your face. And they will be to you for a snare and for a trap and for a whip on your sides and for thorns in your eyes, until you perish from upon this good ground that Yahweh your God has given to you.
\v 14 And behold, today I myself am going in the way of all of the earth. And you know with all of your heart and with all of your soul that not one word has fallen from all of the good words that Yahweh your God spoke concerning you. The whole has come to you. Not one word has fallen from it.
\v 15 And it will happen, just as all of the good word that Yahweh your God spoke to you has come upon you, thus Yahweh will bring upon you all of the evil word until he has destroyed you from upon this good ground that Yahweh your God has given to you.
\v 16 In your transgressing the covenant of Yahweh your God that he commanded you and you go and serve other gods and bow down to them, then the nose of Yahweh will burn against you, and you will quickly perish from upon the good land that he has given to you.”

\v 1 And Joshua gathered all of the tribes of Israel to Shechem. And he called to the elders of Israel and to its heads and to its judges and to its officers. And they presented themselves to the face of God.
\v 2 And Joshua said to all of the people, “Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: ‘Your fathers dwelled from long ago beyond the river, Terah, the father of Abraham and the father of Nahor. And they served other gods.
\v 3 And I took your father Abraham from beyond the river and brought him into all of the land of Canaan. And I multiplied his seed and gave to him Isaac.
\v 4 And I gave Jacob and Esau to Isaac, and I gave to Esau the hill country of Seir to possess it, but Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt.
\v 5 And I sent Moses and Aaron, and I struck Egypt according to what I did in the midst of it. And afterward I brought you out.
\v 6 And I brought your fathers out from Egypt, and you came to the sea. And Egypt chased after your fathers with chariot and horsemen to the Sea of Reeds.
\v 7 And they cried out to Yahweh, and he put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and he brought the sea over him and covered him. And your eyes saw what I did against Egypt. And you dwelled in the wilderness many days.
\v 8 And I brought you to the land of the Amorite, the ones dwelling on the other side of the Jordan, and they fought with you. And I gave them into your hand, and you possessed their land, and I destroyed them from your faces.
\v 9 And Balak, the son of Zippor, the king of Moab, arose and fought with Israel. And he sent and called for Balaam, the son of Beor, to curse you.
\v 10 But I was not willing to listen to Balaam. And blessing, he blessed you, and I delivered you from his hand.
\v 11 And you crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho. And the men of Jericho fought with you, the Amorite and the Perizzite and the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Girgashite and the Hivite and the Jebusite. And I gave them into your hand.
\v 12 And I sent the hornet to your faces, and it dispossessed them out from your faces, the two kings of the Amorite, not by your sword and not by your bow.
\v 13 And I gave to you a land for which you had not labored and cities that you had not built, and you dwelled in them. You {are} eating vineyards and olive groves that you did not plant.’
\v 14 And now, you shall fear Yahweh and serve him with sincerity and with faithfulness. And you shall remove the gods that your fathers served beyond the river and in Egypt, and you shall serve Yahweh.
\v 15 But if {it is} evil in your eyes to serve Yahweh, choose for yourselves today whom you will serve, whether the gods that your fathers served that were beyond the river or the gods of the Amorite in whose land you {are} dwelling. But I and my house, we will serve Yahweh.”
\v 16 And the people answered and said, “Profane to us from leaving Yahweh to serve other gods!
\v 17 For Yahweh, he {is} our God, the one having brought us and our fathers up from the land of Egypt, from the house of slaves, and who did these great signs before our eyes. And he kept us in all of the way in which we went and among all the peoples in whose midst we passed.
\v 18 And Yahweh dispossessed from our faces all of the peoples and the Amorite, the dweller {in} the land. We ourselves will serve Yahweh, for he {is} our God.”
\v 19 And Joshua said to the people, “You will not be able to serve Yahweh, for he {is} a holy God, he {is} a jealous God. He will not lift your transgressions and your sins.
\v 20 If you forsake Yahweh and serve the gods of the foreigner, then he will turn and do harm to you and finish you, after when he has done good to you.”
\v 21 And the people said to Joshua, “No, but we will serve Yahweh.”
\v 22 And Joshua said to the people, “You {are} witnesses against yourselves that you yourselves have chosen Yahweh for yourselves, to serve him.” And they said, “Witnesses.”
\v 23 “And now, remove the gods of the foreigner that are in your midst, and stretch out your heart to Yahweh, the God of Israel.”
\v 24 And the people said to Joshua, “We will serve Yahweh our God, and we will listen to his voice.”
\v 25 And Joshua cut a covenant for the people on that day. And he set for them a statute and a judgment in Shechem.
\v 26 And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the instruction of God. And he took a great stone and set it up there beneath the oak tree that {was} at the Holy Place of Yahweh.
\v 27 And Joshua said to all of the people, “Behold, this stone will be for a witness against us, for it has heard all of the words of Yahweh that he spoke to us. And it will be for a witness against you, lest you deal falsely with your God.”
\v 28 And Joshua sent the people away, a man to his inheritance.
\v 29 And it happened after these things that Joshua, the son of Nun, the servant of Yahweh, died, a son of 110 years.
\v 30 And they buried him in the border of his inheritance, in Timnath Serah, which {is} in the hill country of Ephraim, from the north to Mount Gaash.
\v 31 And Israel served Yahweh all of the days of Joshua and all of the days of the elders who lengthened days after Joshua and who knew every deed of Yahweh that he had done for Israel.
\v 32 And the bones of Joseph, which the sons of Israel had brought up from Egypt, they buried in Shechem, in the portion of the field that Jacob had bought from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem, for 100 qesitah. And it was to the sons of Joseph for an inheritance.
\v 33 And Eleazar, the son of Aaron, died. And they buried him in Gibeah of Phinehas his son, which had been given to him in the hill country of Ephraim.
