\v 1 The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, son of David, son of Abraham:
\v 2 Abraham fathered Isaac, and Isaac fathered Jacob, and Jacob fathered Judah and his brothers,
\v 3 and Judah fathered Perez and Zerah by Tamar, and Perez fathered Hezrom, and Hezrom fathered Aram,

\v 4 and Aram fathered Amminadab, and Amminadab fathered Nahshon, and Nahshon fathered Salmon,
\v 5 and Salmon fathered Boaz by Rahab, and Boaz fathered Obed by Ruth, and Obed fathered Jesse,
\v 6 and Jesse fathered David the king, and David fathered Solomon by the {wife} of Uriah,

\p
\v 7 and Solomon fathered Rehoboam, and Rehoboam fathered Abijah, and Abijah fathered Asaph,
\v 8 and Asaph fathered Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat fathered Joram, and Joram fathered Ozias,

\v 9 and Ozias fathered Jotham, and Jotham fathered Ahaz, and Ahaz fathered Hezekiah,
\v 10 and Hezekiah fathered Manasseh, and Manasseh fathered Amos, and Amos fathered Josiah,
\v 11 and Josiah fathered Jechoniah and his brothers at the Babylonian deportation,

\p
\v 12 and after the Babylonian deportation, Jechoniah fathered Salathiel, and Salathiel fathered Zerubbabel,
\v 13 and Zerubbabel fathered Abiud, and Abiud fathered Eliakim, and Eliakim fathered Azor,
\v 14 and Azor fathered Zadok, and Zadok fathered Achim, and Achim fathered Eliud,

\v 15 and Eliud fathered Eleazar, and Eleazar fathered Matthan, and Matthan fathered Jacob,
\v 16 and Jacob fathered Joseph the husband of Mary, by whom Jesus was born, the one called Christ.

\p
\v 17 Therefore, all the generations from Abraham until David {were} 14 generations, and from David until the Babylonian deportation {were} 14 generations, and from the Babylonian deportation until the Christ {were} 14 generations.

\p
\v 18 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was thus: His mother, Mary, having been engaged to marry Joseph, before they came together, was found having in the womb from the Holy Spirit.
\v 19 Now Joseph her husband, being righteous, and not wanting to publicly disgrace her, intended to divorce her secretly.

\v 20 But he having reflected on these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him by way of a dream, saying, “Joseph, son of David, you should not fear to take Mary as your wife, because the one having been conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
\v 21 And she will bear a son, and you will call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.”

\v 22 Now all this happened so that might be fulfilled {what} was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,
\pm
\v 23 “Behold, the virgin will have in her womb and bear a son, and they will call his name Immanuel”—which is translated, “God with us.”
\pm

\p
\v 24 And Joseph, having been awakened from sleep, did as the angel of the Lord commanded him and took her {as} his wife.
\v 25 And he did not know her until she bore a son. And he called his name Jesus.


\c 2
\p
\v 1 Now, Jesus having been born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, learned men from the east arrived in Jerusalem,
\v 2 saying, “Where is the one having been born King of the Jews? For we saw his star in the east and came to worship him.”

\p
\v 3 But having heard this, Herod the king became troubled, and all Jerusalem with him.

\v 4 And having brought together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired from them, “Where is the Christ being born?”

\p
\v 5 And they said to him, “In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it has been written through the prophet,
\q1 
\v 6 ‘And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah,
\q1
are by no means least among the leaders of Judah,
\q1
for from you will come out a ruling one
\q1
who will shepherd my people Israel.’”

\m
\v 7 Then Herod, having secretly called the learned men, inquired from them the time of the appearing of the star.
\v 8 And having sent them to Bethlehem, he said, “Having gone, search carefully for the young child, and after you have found him, report to me so that I also, having come, might worship him.”

\p
\v 9 And they, having heard the king, went, and behold, the star that they saw in the east was going before them until, having come, it stood over where the young child was.
\v 10 And having seen the star, they rejoiced with very great joy.

\v 11 And having gone into the house, they saw the young child with Mary his mother. And having fallen down, they worshiped him, and having opened their treasures, they offered him gifts: gold and frankincense and myrrh.
\v 12 And having been warned through a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their country by another way.

\p
\v 13 Now they having departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appears to Joseph by means of a dream, saying, “Having gotten up, take the young child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is going to seek the young child to kill him.”
\v 14 And having gotten up, he took the young child and his mother at night and departed for Egypt,
\v 15 and he was there until the death of Herod, in order that might be fulfilled {what} was spoken by the Lord through the prophet, saying,
\q1 “Out of Egypt I called my son.”

\p
\v 16 Then Herod, having seen that he had been mocked by the learned men, was very angry, and having sent forth, he killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all its region, from two years and under, according to the time that he had determined exactly from the learned men.

\v 17 Then it was fulfilled {what} was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying,
\q1 
\v 18 “A voice was heard in Ramah,
\q1
weeping and great mourning,
\q1
Rachel weeping for her children,
\q1
and not willing to be comforted, because they are no more.”

\p
\v 19 Now Herod having died, behold, an angel of the Lord appears by means of a dream to Joseph in Egypt,
\v 20 saying, “Having gotten up, take the young child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for the ones seeking the life of the child have died.”
\v 21 And he, having gotten up, took the young child and his mother, and entered into the land of Israel.

\v 22 But having heard that Archelaus is reigning over Judea in the place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. But having been warned by means of a dream, he withdrew to the region of Galilee,
\v 23 and having gone, he lived in a city being called Nazareth, so that it might be fulfilled {what} was spoken through the prophets, that he will be called a Nazarene.


\c 3
\p
\v 1 Now in those days, John the Baptist comes, preaching in the wilderness of Judea,
\v 2 saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens is near.”
\v 3 For this is the one spoken of through Isaiah the prophet, saying,
\q1
“A voice of one calling out in the wilderness,
\q1
‘Make ready the way of the Lord,
\q1
make his paths straight.’”

\p
\v 4 Now this John had his clothing from the hair of a camel and a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey.
\v 5 Then were going out to him Jerusalem, and all Judea, and all the {region} around the Jordan,
\v 6 and being baptized by him in the Jordan River, confessing their sins.

\v 7 Now, having seen many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for his baptism, he said to them, “Offspring of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath?
\v 8 Therefore, produce fruit worthy of repentance.
\v 9 And you should not think to say in yourselves, ‘We have Abraham {as} father.’ For I say to you that God is able to raise up children for Abraham from these stones.

\v 10 But already the ax is set against the root of the trees. So, every tree not producing good fruit is chopped down and thrown into a fire.
\v 11 I indeed baptize you with water for repentance. But the one coming after me is more powerful than I, of whom I am not worthy to carry away his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire,
\v 12 whose winnowing fork {is} in his hand, and he will thoroughly clear off his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the storehouse. But he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”

\p
\v 13 Then Jesus comes from Galilee to the Jordan, to John, to be baptized by him.
\v 14 But John was hindering him, saying, “I have need to be baptized by you, and yet you come to me?”

\p
\v 15 But answering, Jesus said to him, “Permit {it} now, for in this way it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness.” Then he permits him.

\p
\v 16 Now, having been baptized, Jesus immediately came up from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God coming down like a dove, resting upon him,
\v 17 and behold, a voice from the heavens, saying, “This is my beloved Son with whom I am well pleased.”


\c 4
\p
\v 1 Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
\v 2 And having fasted 40 days and 40 nights, afterward he was hungry.
\v 3 And having approached, the one tempting said to him, “If you are the Son of God, speak so that these stones might become loaves.”

\p
\v 4 But he, answering, said, “It is written, ‘Man will not live on bread alone, but by every word coming through the mouth of God.’”

\p
\v 5 Then the devil takes him into the holy city, and he set him on the highest point of the temple,
\v 6 and says to him, “If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written,
\q1 ‘He will command his angels concerning you,’
\q1 and, ‘They will lift you up in their hands,
\q1 lest you strike your foot against a stone.’”

\p
\v 7 Jesus said to him, “Again it is written, ‘You will not test the Lord your God.’”

\p
\v 8 Again, the devil takes him to a very high mountain and shows him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
\v 9 And he said to him, “All these things I will give you, if having fallen down, you would worship me.”

\p
\v 10 Then Jesus says to him, “Go away, Satan! For it is written, ‘You will worship the Lord your God, and you will serve only him.’”

\p
\v 11 Then the devil leaves him, and behold, angels came and began to minister to him.

\p
\v 12 Now, having heard that John had been arrested, he withdrew into Galilee.
\v 13 And having left Nazareth, having come, he lived in Capernaum by the sea, in the territories of Zebulun and Naphtali,

\v 14 so that it might be fulfilled what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,
\q1 
\v 15 “The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali,
\q1
{ the} way of the sea, beyond the Jordan,
\q1
 Galilee of the Gentiles—
\q1 
\v 16 the people sitting in darkness
\q1
 have seen a great light,
\q1
 and to the ones sitting in the region and shadow of death,
\q1
 upon them has a light arisen.”

\p
\v 17 From that time Jesus began to preach and to say, “Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has come near.”

\p
\v 18 Now walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen.
\v 19 And he says to them, “Come after me, and I will make you fishers of men.”
\v 20 And immediately, they, having left the nets, followed him.

\v 21 And having gone on from there, he saw two other brothers, James the {son} of Zebedee, and John his brother in the boat with Zebedee their father mending their nets, and he called them,
\v 22 and immediately they, having left the boat and their father, followed him.

\p
\v 23 And he was going around in all of Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness among the people.
\v 24 And the news of him went out into all Syria, and they brought to him all the ones having sickness, being afflicted by various diseases and pains, and being possessed by demons, and the epileptic and the paralytic, and he healed them.
\v 25 And large crowds followed him from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judea and beyond the Jordan.


\c 5
\p
\v 1 Now, having seen the crowds, he went up on the mountain, and he having sat down, his disciples came to him.
\v 2 And having opened his mouth, he taught them, saying,

\q1 
\v 3 
“Blessed {are} the poor in spirit,
\q2
 for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.
\q1 
\v 4 Blessed {are} the ones mourning,
\q2
 for they will be comforted.

\q1 
\v 5 Blessed {are} the meek,
\q2
 for they will inherit the earth.
\q1 
\v 6 Blessed {are} the ones hungering and thirsting for righteousness,
\q2
 for they will be fed.
\q1 
\v 7 Blessed {are} the merciful,
\q2
 for they will obtain mercy.
\q1 
\v 8 Blessed {are} the pure in heart,
\q2
 for they will see God.

\q1 
\v 9 Blessed {are} the peacemakers,
\q2
 for they will be called sons of God.
\q1 
\v 10 Blessed {are} the ones persecuted for the sake of righteousness,
\q2
 for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.

\m
\v 11 Blessed are you when they insult you and persecute {you} and say every evil thing against you, lying,\f + \ft A few manuscripts do not include \fqa lying.\fqa*\f*
because of me.
\v 12 Rejoice and be very glad, for your reward {is} great in the heavens, for in this way they persecuted the prophets before you.

\p
\v 13 You are the salt of the earth. But if the salt is made tasteless, with what might it be made salty again? It is good for nothing any longer, except having been thrown out, to be trampled by men.

\p
\v 14 You are the light of the world. A city being set on top of a mountain is not able to be hidden.

\v 15 Neither do they light a lamp and put it under a basket, but rather on the lampstand, and it shines for all the ones in the house.
\v 16 Let your light shine before men in such a way so that they might see your good deeds and might glorify your Father in the heavens.

\p
\v 17 Do not think that I came to destroy the law or the prophets. I came not to destroy but to fulfill.
\v 18 For truly I say to you, until the heaven and the earth passes away, one jot or one tittle will certainly not pass away from the law until all things are accomplished.

\v 19 Therefore, whoever annuls one of the least of these commandments and teaches men to do so will be called least in the kingdom of the heavens. But whoever does and teaches {them}, that one will be called great in the kingdom of the heavens.
\v 20 For I say to you that unless your righteousness abounds more than that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will certainly not enter into the kingdom of the heavens.

\p
\v 21 You have heard that it was said to the ancient ones, ‘Do not kill,’ and, ‘Whoever kills will be subject to the judgment.’
\v 22 But I say to you that everyone being angry with his brother\f + \ft Some ancient manuscripts add the phrase \fq without cause\fq* here.\f*
will be subject to the judgment. And whoever says to his brother, ‘Raka!’ will be subject to the council. And whoever says, ‘You fool!’ will be subject to the Gehenna of fire.

\v 23 Therefore, if you offer your gift at the altar and there you remember that your brother has something against you,
\v 24 leave your gift there in front of the altar and go; first be reconciled with your brother, and then, having come, offer your gift.

\v 25 Be in agreement with your accuser quickly while you are with him on the way, lest your accuser might hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the officer, and you will be thrown into prison.
\v 26 Truly I say to you, you will certainly not come out from there until you have paid the last quadrans.

\p
\v 27 You have heard that it was said, ‘Do not commit adultery.’
\v 28 But I say to you that everyone looking at a woman to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.

\v 29 But if your right eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw {it} away from you. For it is better for you that one of your members would perish and your whole body would not be thrown into Gehenna.
\v 30 And if your right hand causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw {it} away from you. For it is better for you that one of your members would perish and your whole body would not go into Gehenna.

\v 31 Now it has been said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.’
\v 32 But I say to you that everyone divorcing his wife, except for a report of sexual immorality, causes her to commit adultery. And whoever marries {the one who} has been divorced commits adultery.

\p
\v 33 Again, you have heard that it was said to the ancient ones, ‘Do not break an oath, but carry out your oaths to the Lord.’
\v 34 But I tell you not to swear at all, neither by heaven, for it is the throne of God;
\v 35 nor by the earth, for it is a footstool for his feet; nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King.

\v 36 Neither should you swear by your head, for you are not able to make one hair white or black.
\v 37 But let your word be ‘Yes, yes,’ {or} ‘No, no.’ But anything greater than this is from the evil one.

\p
\v 38 You have heard that it was said, ‘An eye in exchange for an eye, and a tooth in exchange for a tooth.’
\v 39 But I tell you not to resist the evil one. Instead, whoever strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.

\v 40 And to the one wanting to have judgment passed upon you and to take away your tunic, let him also have your cloak.
\v 41 And whoever will press you into service for one mile, go with him two.
\v 42 Give to the one asking you, and do not turn away from the one wanting to borrow from you.

\p
\v 43 You have heard that it was said, ‘Love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’
\v 44 But I say to you, love your enemies\f + \ft Some ancient manuscripts include here \fqa bless the ones cursing you, do good to the ones hating you.\fqa*\f*
and pray on behalf of the ones persecuting you
\v 45 so that you might be sons of your Father in the heavens. For he makes his sun to rise on the evil and the good, and he sends rain on the just and the unjust.

\v 46 For if you love the ones loving you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same thing?
\v 47 And if you greet only your brothers, what do you do more? Do not even the Gentiles\f + \ft Instead of \fq Gentiles,\fq* some manuscripts read \fqa tax collectors.\fqa*\f*
do the same thing?
\v 48 Therefore, you shall be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.


\c 6
\p
\v 1 Now take heed not to do your righteousness before men to be seen by them, otherwise, you do not have a reward with your Father in the heavens.

\p
\v 2 So when you give alms, do not sound a trumpet before yourself even as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets so that they may be glorified by men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full.

\v 3 But you, giving alms, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing
\v 4 so that your alms may be in secret, and your Father seeing in secret will reward you\f + \ft Some manuscripts add the phrase \fq in the open\fq* here.\f*.

\p
\v 5 And when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, for they love to pray, having stood in the synagogues and on the corners of the street, so that they may be seen by men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full.
\v 6 But you, when you pray, enter into your inner chamber, and having shut your door, pray to your Father in secret, and your Father seeing in secret will reward you\f + \ft Some manuscripts add the phrase \fq in the open\fq* here.\f*.

\v 7 Now praying, do not make useless repetitions even as the Gentiles, for they think that because of their many words they will be heard.

\v 8 Therefore, you should not be like them, for your Father knows what need you have before you ask him.

\p
\v 9 Therefore, you must pray like this:
\q1
‘Our Father in the heavens,
\q1
 let your name be made holy.
\q1 
\v 10 Let your kingdom come,
\q1
 let your will be done
\q2
 as in heaven also on earth.

\q1 
\v 11 Give us today our daily bread;
\q1
\v 12 and forgive us our debts,
\q2
 as we also forgave our debtors;
\q1
\v 13 and do not bring us into temptation,
\q2
 but deliver us from the evil one.’\f + \ft Some ancient manuscripts include here \fqa For yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.\fqa*\f*

\m
\v 14 For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
\v 15 But if you do not forgive the men\f + \ft Instead of \fq the men,\fq* some manuscripts read \fqa men their trespasses.\fqa*\f*, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses.

\p
\v 16 Now when you fast, do not be mournful as the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces so that they may be seen as fasting by men. Truly I say to you, they have their reward in full.
\v 17 But you, {when} fasting, anoint your head and wash your face
\v 18 so that you would not be seen as fasting by men, but only by your Father in secret; and your Father, seeing in secret, will reward you\f + \ft Some manuscripts add the phrase \fq in the open\fq* here.\f*.

\p
\v 19 Do not store up for yourselves treasures on the earth, where moth and rust destroy, and where thieves break in and steal.
\v 20 Instead, store up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys, and where thieves do not break in nor steal.
\v 21 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

\p
\v 22 The lamp of the body is the eye. Therefore, if your eye is healthy, your whole body will be illuminated.
\v 23 But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be dark. Therefore, if the light in you is darkness, how great {is} the darkness!

\p
\v 24 No one is able to serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and will love the other, or else he will be devoted to one and will despise the other. You are not able to serve God and wealth.

\p
\v 25 Because of this I say to you, do not worry about your life, what you might eat or what you might drink,\f + \ft Some manuscripts do not include the words \fq or what you might drink.\fq*\f*
nor about your body, what you might wear. Is not life more than food, and the body, {than} clothing?
\v 26 Look at the birds of the sky, that they do not sow nor reap nor gather into barns, but your heavenly Father feeds them. {Are} you not more valuable than they?

\v 27 But which of you, being anxious, is able to add one cubit to his lifespan?

\p
\v 28 And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field—how they grow. They do not labor, neither do they spin.
\v 29 But I say to you that not even Solomon in all his glory clothed himself like one of these.

\v 30 But if God thus clothes the grass of the field, existing today and tomorrow being thrown into an oven, {will he} not much more you, ones of little faith?
\v 31 Therefore, you should not be anxious, saying, ‘What might we eat?’ or, ‘What might we drink?’ or, ‘What might we wear?’

\v 32 For the Gentiles seek all these things; for your heavenly Father knows that you need all of these things.
\v 33 But seek first the kingdom\f + \ft Some manuscripts add the phrase \fq of God\fq* here.\f*
and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you.
\v 34 Therefore, you should not be anxious for tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day {is} its evil.


\c 7
\p
\v 1 Do not judge, so that you will not be judged.
\v 2 For with the judgment by which you judge, you will be judged, and with the measure by which you measure, it will be measured to you.

\v 3 Now why do you look at the speck of wood that {is} in the eye of your brother, but you do not notice the log in your eye?
\v 4 Or how will you say to your brother, ‘Let me take out the speck of wood from your eye,’ while behold, the log {is} in your eye?
\v 5 You hypocrite! First take out the log from your eye, and then you will see clearly to take out the speck of wood from the eye of your brother.

\v 6 You should neither give the holy to the dogs nor should you throw your pearls in front of the pigs. Otherwise, they will trample them under their feet, and having turned, they will tear you to pieces.

\p
\v 7 Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you.
\v 8 For everyone asking receives; and the one seeking finds; and to the one knocking, it will be opened.
\v 9 Or what man is there from among you, of whom his son will ask for bread—he will not give him a stone, will he?
\v 10 Or he will also ask for a fish—he will not give him a snake, will he?

\v 11 Therefore, if you, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in the heavens give good things to the ones asking him?
\v 12 Therefore, all things in as much as you desire that men do to you, in this manner also, you do to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets.

\p
\v 13 Enter through the narrow gate. For wide {is} the gate and broad {is} the road that is leading to destruction, and there are many entering through it.
\v 14 For the gate {is} narrow and the road has been made narrow\f + \ft Many ancient manuscripts read, \fq How narrow is the gate and having been made narrow the road.\fq*\f*
that is leading to life, and there are few finding it.

\p
\v 15 Beware of the false prophets, who come to you in sheep’s clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.
\v 16 By their fruits you will recognize them. They do not gather grapes from a thornbush or figs from thistles, do they?
\v 17 In the same way, every good tree produces good fruits, but the rotten tree produces bad fruits.

\v 18 A good tree is not able to produce bad fruits, nor a rotten tree to produce good fruits.
\v 19 Every tree not producing good fruit is cut down and thrown into a fire.
\v 20 So then, by their fruits you will recognize them.

\p
\v 21 Not everyone saying to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the kingdom of the heavens, but the one doing the will of my Father in the heavens.
\v 22 Many will say to me in that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name cast out demons, and in your name do many mighty deeds?’
\v 23 And then I will publicly declare to them, ‘I never knew you! Go away from me, the ones practicing lawlessness!’

\p
\v 24 Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and does them will be compared to a wise man who built his house upon the rock.
\v 25 And the rain came down, and the floods came, and the winds blew and struck against that house, but it did not fall down, for it had been founded on the rock.

\v 26 But everyone hearing these words of mine and not doing them will be compared to a foolish man who built his house upon the sand.
\v 27 And the rain came down, and the floods came, and the winds blew and struck against that house, and it fell, and its destruction was great.”

\p
\v 28 And it happened that when Jesus finished speaking these words, the crowds were astonished at his teaching,
\v 29 for he was teaching them as having authority, and not as their scribes.


\c 8
\p
\v 1 Now {when} he had come down from the mountain, large crowds followed him.
\v 2 And behold, a leper, having approached, bowed before him, saying, “Lord, if you are willing, you are able to make me clean.”

\p
\v 3 And having reached out his hand, he touched him, saying, “I am willing. Be clean.” And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.

\v 4 And Jesus says to him, “See that you tell no one, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a testimony to them.”

\p
\v 5 Now {when} he had entered into Capernaum, a centurion came to him, begging him
\v 6 and saying, “Lord, my servant has been lying in the house paralyzed, being tormented terribly.”

\p
\v 7 And he says to him, “I, {when} I have come, will heal him.”

\p
\v 8 And answering, the centurion said, “Lord, I am not worthy that you might enter under my roof, but only speak a word, and my servant will be healed.
\v 9 For I also am a man placed under authority, having soldiers under me, and I say to this one, ‘Go,’ and he goes; and to another one, ‘Come,’ and he comes; and to my servant, ‘Do this,’ and he does {it}.”

\p
\v 10 But having heard this, Jesus was amazed and said to the ones following him, “Truly I say to you, I have found such great faith from no one in Israel\f + \ft Instead of \fq I have found such great faith from no one in Israel,\fq* some manuscripts read \fqa not even in Israel have I found such great faith.\fqa*\f*.

\v 11 But I tell you that many will come from east and west, and they will recline to eat with Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of the heavens.
\v 12 But the sons of the kingdom will be thrown out into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and grinding of the teeth.”
\v 13 And Jesus said to the centurion, “Go! As you believed, let it be done for you.” And the servant was healed at that hour.

\p
\v 14 And {when} Jesus had come into the house of Peter, he saw his mother-in-law having been laid down and being sick with a fever.
\v 15 And he touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she got up and began to serve him.

\v 16 Now evening having come, they brought to him many being possessed by demons, and he cast out the spirits with a word and healed all the ones having sickness,
\v 17 so that might be fulfilled that which had been spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying, “He himself took our sicknesses and bore our diseases.”

\p
\v 18 Now Jesus, having seen a crowd\f + \ft Instead of \fq a crowd,\fq* some manuscripts read \fqa large crowds.\fqa*\f*
around him, commanded to depart to the other side.
\v 19 And having approached, a scribe said to him, “Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go.”

\p
\v 20 And Jesus says to him, “The foxes have dens, and the birds of the sky, nests, but the Son of Man does not have {a place} where he might lay his head.”

\p
\v 21 Now another of the disciples said to him, “Lord, permit me first to go away and to bury my father.”

\p
\v 22 But Jesus says to him, “Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead.”

\p
\v 23 And {when} he had gotten into a boat, his disciples followed him.
\v 24 And behold, a great storm happened on the sea, so that the boat was covered by the waves. But he was sleeping.
\v 25 And having approached, they woke him, saying, “Lord, save us; we are perishing!”

\p
\v 26 And he says to them, “Why are you cowardly, you of little faith?” Then, having gotten up, he rebuked the winds and the sea, and a great calm happened.

\p
\v 27 But the men marveled, saying, “What sort of {man} is he, that even the winds and the sea obey him?”

\p
\v 28 And {when} he had come to the other side, to the region of the Gadarenes\f + \ft Instead of \fq Gadarenes,\fq* some manuscripts read \fqa Gergesenes,\fqa* and other manuscripts read \fqa Gerasenes.\fqa*\f*, two men met him, being possessed by demons, coming out of the tombs, very violent, so that no one was strong enough to pass through that road.
\v 29 And behold, they cried out, saying, “What to us and to you, Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the set time?”

\v 30 Now a herd of many pigs was feeding at a distance from them.
\v 31 But the demons were begging him, saying, “If you cast us out, send us away into the herd of the pigs.”

\p
\v 32 And he said to them, “Go!” And they, having come out, went away into the pigs; and behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep slope into the sea, and they died in the water.

\v 33 Now the ones feeding them ran away and, having gone away to the city, they reported everything, and the {things concerning} the ones possessed by demons.
\v 34 And behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus. And having seen him, they begged him that he would depart from their region.


\c 9
\p
\v 1 And having gotten into a boat, he crossed over and came to his own city.
\v 2 And behold, they were bringing to him a paralytic lying on a mat. And Jesus, having seen their faith, said to the paralytic, “Child, have courage. Your sins are forgiven.”

\p
\v 3 And behold, some of the scribes said among themselves, “This one blasphemes.”

\p
\v 4 And Jesus, having seen their thoughts, said, “For what reason do you think evil in your hearts?
\v 5 For which is easier, to say, ‘Your sins have been forgiven,’ or to say, ‘Get up and walk’?
\v 6 But in order that you might know that the Son of Man has authority on the earth to forgive sins,”—he then says to the paralytic—“Getting up, pick up your mat, and go to your house.”

\v 7 And having gotten up, he went away to his house.
\v 8 Now {when} the crowds had seen this, they were afraid\f + \ft Instead of \fq they were afraid,\fq* some manuscripts read \fqa they marveled.\fqa*\f*
and glorified God, having given such authority to men.

\p
\v 9 And Jesus, passing on from there, saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector’s office, and he says to him, “Follow me.” And having gotten up, he followed him.

\p
\v 10 And it happened that he was reclining to eat in the house, and behold, many tax collectors and sinners, having come, were dining with Jesus and his disciples.
\v 11 And the Pharisees, having seen this, were saying to his disciples, “Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?”

\p
\v 12 But he, having heard this, said, “The ones being healthy do not have need of a physician, but the ones having sickness.
\v 13 But having gone, learn what this is: ‘I desire mercy and not sacrifice.’ For I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners.”

\p
\v 14 Then the disciples of John come to him, saying, “For what reason do we and the Pharisees often fast, but your disciples do not fast?”

\p
\v 15 And Jesus said to them, “The sons of the bridal chamber are not able to mourn while the bridegroom is still with them, are they? But days will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.

\v 16 Now no one puts a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for its patch tears away from the garment, and a worse tear happens.

\v 17 Neither do they put new wine into old wineskins. But if not, the skins are burst, and the wine is spilled, and the wineskins are destroyed. But they put new wine into new wineskins, and both are preserved.”

\p
\v 18 {While} he was saying these things to them, behold, a certain official, having approached, bowed down to him, saying, “My daughter has just now died, but, having come, lay your hand on her, and she will live.”
\v 19 And having gotten up, Jesus and his disciples followed him.

\p
\v 20 And behold, a woman suffering from a discharge of blood for 12 years, having approached from behind, touched the edge of his cloak,
\v 21 for she was saying in herself, “If only I touch his cloak, I will be saved.”

\p
\v 22 But Jesus, having turned and having seen her, said, “Daughter, take courage; your faith has saved you.” And the woman was saved from that hour.

\p
\v 23 And Jesus, having come to the house of the official and having seen the flute players and the crowd being disturbed,
\v 24 said, “Go away, for the girl has not died, but sleeps.” And they were laughing at him.

\v 25 But when the crowd had been put outside, having entered, he took her hand, and the girl was raised up.
\v 26 And this report went out into all that region.

\p
\v 27 And {as} Jesus was departing from there, two blind men followed him, crying out and saying, “Have mercy on us, Son of David!”

\p
\v 28 Now {when} he had come into the house, the blind men came to him and Jesus says to them, “Do you believe that I am able to do this?”
\p
They say to him, “Yes, Lord.”

\p
\v 29 Then he touched their eyes, saying, “Let it be done to you according to your faith.”
\v 30 And their eyes were opened, and Jesus warned them, saying, “See that you let no one know {about this}.”
\v 31 But they, having gone out, reported it in all that region.

\p
\v 32 Now {as} they were going away, behold, they brought to him a mute, demon-possessed man.
\v 33 And the demon having been cast out, the mute {man} spoke, and the crowds marveled, saying, “Such as this has never been seen in Israel!”

\p
\v 34 But the Pharisees were saying, “By the ruler of the demons he casts out the demons.”

\p
\v 35 And Jesus was going around all the cities and the villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every sickness.
\v 36 Now, having seen the crowds, he felt compassion for them, because they were troubled and discouraged, like sheep not having a shepherd.

\v 37 Then he says to his disciples, “Indeed, the harvest {is} plentiful, but the laborers {are} few.
\v 38 Therefore, earnestly ask the Lord of the harvest, so that he might send out laborers into his harvest.”


\c 10
\p
\v 1 And having summoned his 12 disciples, he gave them authority over unclean spirits, so as to cast them out and to heal every disease and every sickness.

\v 2 Now the names of the 12 apostles are these: first, Simon (called Peter), and Andrew his brother; and James the {son} of Zebedee, and John his brother;
\v 3 Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the {son} of Alphaeus and Thaddaeus\f + \ft Instead of \fq Thaddaeus,\fq* some manuscripts read \fqa Lebbaeus, who was surnamed Thaddaeus.\fqa*\f*;
\v 4 Simon the Cananaios, and Judas Iscariot, the {one} having also handed him over.

\p
\v 5 These 12 Jesus sent out, having instructed them, saying, “Do not go on the way {to the} Gentiles, and do not enter into a city of the Samaritans.
\v 6 But go instead to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.
\v 7 Now {as} you are going, preach, saying, ‘The kingdom of the heavens has come near.’

\v 8 Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, {and} cast out demons. Freely you have received; freely give.
\v 9 Do not acquire gold or silver or copper in your belts,
\v 10 nor a bag for the road nor two tunics nor sandals nor a staff, for the laborer {is} worthy of his food.

\v 11 But whatever city or village you enter into, find someone who is worthy in it and stay there until you go out.
\v 12 Now entering into the house, greet it.
\v 13 And if indeed the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it, but if it is not worthy, let your peace be returned to you.

\v 14 And whoever does not receive you nor listen to your words, departing from that house or city, shake off the dust from your feet.
\v 15 Truly I say to you, it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah in the day of judgment than for that city.

\p
\v 16 Behold, I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves, so become wise as the serpents and harmless as the doves.
\v 17 But beware of the men, for they will hand you over to councils, and they will whip you in their synagogues;
\v 18 and you will be brought also before governors and kings for my sake, for a testimony to them and to the Gentiles.

\v 19 But when they hand you over, do not worry about how or what you will speak, for what you will say will be given to you in that hour.
\v 20 For you are not the one speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.

\p
\v 21 Now brother will hand over brother to death, and a father, his child, and children will rise up against parents and put them to death.
\v 22 And you will be hated by all because of my name, but the one having endured to the end, this one will be saved.
\v 23 But whenever they persecute you in this city, flee to the next, for truly I say to you, you will certainly not finish the cities of Israel before the Son of Man comes.

\p
\v 24 A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a slave above his master.
\v 25 It is enough for the disciple that he might be like his teacher, and the slave like his master. If they called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much worse the members of his household!

\v 26 Therefore, do not fear them, for there is nothing concealed that will not be revealed, and hidden, that will not be made known.
\v 27 What I tell you in the darkness, say in the light, and what you hear in your ear, proclaim upon the housetops.

\v 28 And do not be afraid of the ones killing the body but not being able to kill the soul. But instead, fear the one being able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.
\v 29 Are not two sparrows sold for an assarion? And yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father.
\v 30 But even the hairs of your head are all numbered.
\v 31 Therefore, do not fear; you are more valuable than many sparrows.

\p
\v 32 Therefore, everyone who will confess about me before men, I will also confess about him before my Father in the heavens.
\v 33 But whoever denies me before men, I will also deny him before my Father in the heavens.

\p
\v 34 Do not think that I came to bring peace upon the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.
\v 35 For I came to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law;
\v 36 and the enemies of a man {will be} the ones of his household.

\p
\v 37 The one loving father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; and the one loving son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.
\v 38 And whoever does not take up his cross and follow after me is not worthy of me.
\v 39 The one having found his life will lose it, and the one having lost his life for my sake will find it.

\p
\v 40 The one receiving you receives me, and the one receiving me receives the one having sent me.
\v 41 The one receiving a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive a reward of a prophet, and the one receiving a righteous {man} in the name of a righteous {man} will receive a reward of a righteous {man}.

\v 42 And whoever gives to one of these little ones a cup of cold water to drink only in the name of a disciple, truly I say to you, he will certainly not lose his reward.”


\c 11
\p
\v 1 And it happened that when Jesus had finished giving orders to his 12 disciples, he departed from there to teach and to preach in their cities.

\p
\v 2 Now John, having heard in the prison about the deeds of Christ, having sent through his disciples,
\v 3 said to him, “Are you the one coming, or should we expect another?”

\p
\v 4 And answering, Jesus said to them, “Having gone, report to John what you hear and see.
\v 5 The blind see again, and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised, and the poor are being told the gospel.
\v 6 And blessed is whoever is not caused to stumble on me.”

\p
\v 7 Now, {as} these were going on their way, Jesus began to say to the crowds concerning John, “What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind?
\v 8 But what did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, the ones wearing soft clothing are in the houses of the kings.

\v 9 But why did you go out? To see a prophet? Yes, I say to you, and more than a prophet.
\v 10 This is he concerning whom it is written,
\pm
‘Behold, I am sending my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.’
\pm
\m
\v 11 Truly I say to you, among those born of women there has not arisen one greater than John the Baptist, but the least in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he.
\v 12 But from the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of the heavens suffers violence, and violent men take it by force.

\v 13 For all the Prophets and the Law have prophesied until John;
\v 14 and if you are willing to accept {it}, he is Elijah, the one being about to come.
\v 15 The one having ears to hear\f + \ft Some manuscripts do not include the phrase \fq to hear\fq* here.\f*, let him hear.

\p
\v 16 Now to what will I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplace, who are calling out to the others,
\v 17 saying, ‘We played a flute for you, and you did not dance. We sang a funeral song, and you did not mourn.’

\v 18 For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, ‘He has a demon.’
\v 19 The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, ‘Behold a man, a glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!’ But wisdom has been justified by her children.”\f + \ft Instead of \fq her children,\fq* some manuscripts read, \fqa her works.\fqa*\f*

\p
\v 20 Then he began to rebuke the cities in which most of his miracles were done, because they had not repented.
\v 21 “Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles had happened in Tyre and Sidon which happened in you, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
\v 22 Nevertheless, I say to you, it will be more tolerable for Tyre and Sidon in the day of judgment than for you.

\v 23 And you, Capernaum, you will not be exalted to heaven, will you? You will be brought down as far as Hades.\f + \ft Instead of a question and a statement, some manuscripts have just a statement: \fqa And you, Capernaum, the one being exalted to heaven, will be brought down as far as Hades.\fqa*\f*
For if the miracles that happened in you had happened in Sodom, it would have remained until today.
\v 24 Nevertheless, I say to you that it will be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for you.”

\p
\v 25 At that time, answering, Jesus said, “I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you concealed these things from the wise and intelligent and revealed them to little children.
\v 26 Yes, Father, for thus it was well-pleasing before you.

\p
\v 27 All things have been handed over to me by my Father; and no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son, and to whomever the Son desires to reveal him.

\v 28 Come to me, all the ones laboring and heavy burdened, and I will give you rest.
\v 29 Take my yoke on you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
\v 30 For my yoke {is} easy and my burden is light.”


\c 12
\p
\v 1 At that time, Jesus went on the Sabbaths through the grainfields, but his disciples were hungry and began to pick heads of grain and to eat {them}.
\v 2 But the Pharisees, having seen this, said to him, “Behold, your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on a Sabbath.”

\p
\v 3 But he said to them, “Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and the ones with him—
\v 4 how he went into the house of God and ate the loaves of the Presence, which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for the ones with him, except only for the priests?

\v 5 Or have you not read in the law that on the Sabbaths the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath, but are innocent?
\v 6 But I say to you that something greater than the temple is here.

\v 7 But if you had known what this is, ‘I desire mercy and not sacrifice,’ you would not have condemned the innocent.
\v 8 For the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath.”

\p
\v 9 And having departed from there, he went into their synagogue.
\v 10 And behold, a man having a withered hand, and they questioned him, saying, “Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbaths?” so that they might accuse him.

\p
\v 11 But he said to them, “What man will there be among you who will have one sheep, and if it might fall into a pit on the Sabbaths, will not grasp hold of it and lift {it} out?
\v 12 How much more valuable, then, {is} a man than a sheep? Therefore, it is lawful to do good on the Sabbaths.”

\v 13 Then he says to the man, “Stretch out your hand.” And he stretched {it} out, and it was restored to health, just like the other.
\v 14 But having gone out, the Pharisees took counsel against him so that they might destroy him.

\p
\v 15 But Jesus, having perceived this, withdrew from there. And many followed him, and he healed them all,
\v 16 and he rebuked them so that they might not make him known,
\v 17 so that it might be fulfilled what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet, saying,

\q1 
\v 18 “Behold, my servant whom I have chosen;
\q1
my beloved, in whom my soul was well pleased.
\q1
I will put my Spirit upon him,
\q1
and he will announce justice to the Gentiles.

\q1 
\v 19 He will not strive nor cry aloud;
\q1
neither will anyone hear his voice in the streets.
\q1 
\v 20 He will not break a bruised reed;
\q1
and he will not quench a smoking flax,
\q1
until he casts out justice to victory,
\q1 
\v 21 and in his name Gentiles will hope.”

\p
\v 22 Then one being demon-possessed was brought to him, blind and mute, and he healed him, so that the mute one spoke and saw.
\v 23 And all the crowds were amazed and were saying, “Is this not the Son of David?”

\p
\v 24 But the Pharisees, having heard this, said, “He does not cast out demons except by Beelzebul, ruler of the demons.”

\p
\v 25 But having known their thoughts, he said to them, “Every kingdom divided against itself is made desolate, and every city or house divided against itself will not stand.

\v 26 And if Satan casts out Satan, he has been divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand?
\v 27 And if I cast out the demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Because of this they will be your judges.

\v 28 But if I cast out the demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.
\v 29 Or how is anyone able to enter into the house of the strong man and steal his possessions if he has not first bound the strong man? And then he will plunder his house.

\p
\v 30 The one not being with me is against me, and the one not gathering with me scatters.

\p
\v 31 For this reason I say to you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven men, but the blasphemy of the Spirit will not be forgiven.
\v 32 And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man, it will be forgiven him. But whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit, it will not be forgiven him, neither in this age, nor in the one coming.

\p
\v 33 Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree rotten and its fruit rotten, for the tree is known by its fruit.
\v 34 You offspring of vipers, being evil, how are you able to say good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks.
\v 35 The good man from his good treasure brings forth good things, and the evil man from his evil treasure brings forth evil things.

\v 36 But I say to you that every careless word that men will speak, they will give an account concerning it in the day of judgment.
\v 37 For by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.”

\p
\v 38 Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying, “Teacher, we wish to see a sign from you.”

\p
\v 39 But answering, he said to them, “An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign, but a sign will not be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet.
\v 40 For just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the big fish, in this manner the Son of Man will be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.

\v 41 The men of Nineveh will rise up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah {is} here.

\v 42 The Queen of the South will stand up in the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon {is} here.

\p
\v 43 Now when the unclean spirit has gone out from the man, it passes through waterless places seeking rest, and it does not find any.
\v 44 Then it says, ‘I will return to my house from which I came out.’ And having come, it finds {it} being empty, having been swept out and put in order.
\v 45 Then it goes and takes along with itself seven other spirits more evil than itself and they having entered, it resides there. And the last things of that man become worse than the first things. Thus it will be also with this evil generation.”

\p
\v 46 {While} he was still speaking to the crowds, behold, his mother and brothers had stood outside, seeking to speak to him.
\v 47 \f + \ft Some ancient manuscripts do not include this verse.\f*
Now someone said to him, “Behold, your mother and your brothers have stood outside, seeking to speak to you.”

\p
\v 48 But answering, he said to the one speaking to him, “Who is my mother and who are my brothers?”
\v 49 And having stretched out his hand toward his disciples, he said, “Behold, my mother and my brothers!
\v 50 For whoever does the will of my Father in the heavens, he is my brother and sister and mother.”


\c 13
\p
\v 1 On that day, Jesus, having gone out of the house, was sitting beside the sea.
\v 2 And large crowds were gathered to him. As a result, having gotten into a boat, he sat down, and the whole crowd stood on the beach.

\p
\v 3 And he spoke many things to them in parables, saying, “Behold, the sower went out to sow.
\v 4 And as he sowed, some fell beside the road, and the birds came and devoured them.
\v 5 But others fell on the rocky ground, where it did not have much soil, and immediately it sprang up, because it did not have deep soil.
\v 6 But {when} the sun had risen, it was scorched, and because it had no root, it withered.

\v 7 But others fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them.
\v 8 But others fell on good soil and were giving fruit, some 100, and some 60, and some 30.
\v 9 The one having ears\f + \ft Some manuscripts include the phrase \fq to hear\fq* here.\f*, let him hear.”

\p
\v 10 And having approached, the disciples said to him, “For what reason do you speak to them in parables?”

\p
\v 11 But he, answering, said to them, “To you has been given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, but to those it has not been given.
\v 12 For whoever has, it will be given to him, and he will have an abundance. But whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.

\v 13 For this reason I speak to them in parables; because seeing, they do not see; and hearing, they do not hear nor understand.
\v 14 And in them the prophecy of Isaiah is being fulfilled, which says,
\q1
‘In hearing you will hear, but you will certainly not understand;
\q1
and seeing, you will see, but you will certainly not perceive.

\q1 
\v 15 For the heart of this people has been thickened,
\q1
and with {their} ears they have hardly heard,
\q1
and they have shut their eyes,
\q1
lest they might see with {their} eyes,
\q1
and they might hear with {their} ears,
\q1
and they might understand with {their} heart and turn back,
\q1
and I would heal them.’

\p
\v 16 But blessed {are} your eyes, for they see; and your ears, for they hear.
\v 17 For truly I say to you that many prophets and righteous ones longed to see what you see, and did not see, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear.

\p
\v 18 You, therefore, listen to the parable of the sower.
\v 19 Everyone hearing the word of the kingdom and not understanding, the evil one comes and snatches away {what} had been sown in his heart. This is {what} was sown beside the road.

\v 20 Now the one having been sown on the rocky ground, this is the one hearing the word and immediately receiving it with joy;
\v 21 but he has no root in himself but is temporary; and tribulation or persecution having happened because of the word, immediately he is caused to stumble.

\v 22 Now the one having been sown among the thorns, this is the one hearing the word, but the worry of this age and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it becomes unfruitful.
\v 23 Now the one having been sown on the good soil, this is the one hearing the word and understanding {it}, who indeed bears fruit and yields, some 100, and some 60, and some 30.”

\p
\v 24 He set before them another parable, saying, “The kingdom of the heavens is compared to a man having sown good seed in his field.
\v 25 But while the men slept, his enemy came and sowed darnel among the wheat and went away.
\v 26 Now when the blades sprouted and produced a crop, then the darnel became visible also.

\v 27 Now the servants of the master of the house, having approached, said to him, ‘Master, did you not sow good seed in your field? From where then does it have darnel?’

\p
\v 28 But he was saying to them, ‘A hostile man did this.’
\p
But the servants say to him, ‘Do you therefore desire that, having gone out, we would gather them?’

\p
\v 29 But he says, ‘Certainly not, lest gathering the darnel, you might uproot the wheat along with them.
\v 30 Permit both to grow together until the harvest, and at the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, “First gather the darnel and tie them in bundles to burn them up but gather the wheat into my barn.”’”

\p
\v 31 He set before them another parable, saying, “The kingdom of the heavens is like a mustard seed which, having taken, a man sowed in his field;
\v 32 which is indeed the smallest of all the seeds, but when it grows, it is greater than the vegetable plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the sky come and nest in its branches.”

\v 33 He spoke to them another parable: “The kingdom of the heavens is like yeast that a woman, having taken, mixed with three seahs of flour until it was all leavened.”

\p
\v 34 All these things Jesus spoke in parables to the crowds, and he was speaking nothing to them without a parable,
\v 35 so that {what} had been said through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying,
\q1
“I will open my mouth in parables.
\q1
I will declare {what} has been hidden from the foundation of the world.”

\p
\v 36 Then, having left the crowds, he went into the house. And his disciples approached him, saying, “Explain to us the parable of the darnel of the field.”

\p
\v 37 Now answering, he said, “The one sowing the good seed is the Son of Man,
\v 38 and the field is the world, and the good seed—these are the sons of the kingdom. And the darnel are the sons of the evil one,
\v 39 and the enemy having sowed them is the devil. And the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are angels.

\v 40 Therefore, just as the darnel are gathered and burned with fire, thus it will be at the end of the age.
\v 41 The Son of Man will send out his angels, and they will gather from his kingdom all the stumbling blocks and the ones doing lawlessness.
\v 42 And they will throw them into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and grinding of the teeth.
\v 43 Then the righteous will shine as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. The one having ears\f + \ft Some manuscripts include the phrase \fq to hear\fq* here.\f*, let him hear.

\p
\v 44 The kingdom of the heavens is like a treasure hidden in a field, which, having found, a man hid. And from his joy, he goes and sells everything, as much as he has, and buys that field.
\v 45 Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a man, a merchant, seeking fine pearls.
\v 46 And having found one very valuable pearl, having gone away, he sold everything, as much as he had, and bought it.

\p
\v 47 Again, the kingdom of the heavens is like a net having been cast into the sea, and having gathered from every kind,
\v 48 which, when it was filled, having dragged onto the beach, and having sat down, they gathered the good things into containers, but the rotten things they threw out.

\v 49 Thus it will be at the end of the age: The angels will go out and will separate the wicked from among the righteous,
\v 50 and they will throw them into the furnace of fire, where there will be weeping and grinding of the teeth.
\v 51 Have you understood all these things?”
\p
They say to him, “Yes.”

\p
\v 52 Now he said to them, “For this reason, every scribe having been discipled for the kingdom of the heavens is like a man, the master of the house, who brings forth new and old from his treasure.”
\p
\v 53 And it happened that when Jesus finished these parables, he departed from there.

\v 54 And having come to his hometown, he was teaching them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished and said, “From where to this one {is} this wisdom and these miracles?
\v 55 Is not this the son of the carpenter? Is not his mother called Mary, and his brothers, James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?
\v 56 And are not all his sisters with us? From where, therefore, to this one {are} all these things?”

\p
\v 57 And they were being caused to stumble on him. But Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and in his house.”
\v 58 And he did not do many miracles there, because of their unbelief.


\c 14
\p
\v 1 At that time, Herod the tetrarch heard the news about Jesus.
\v 2 And he said to his servants, “This is John the Baptist. He has been raised from the dead, and because of this the powers work in him.”

\p
\v 3 For Herod, having seized John, bound him and put him in prison because of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip.
\v 4 For John was saying to him, “It is not lawful for you to have her.”
\v 5 And wanting to put him to death, he feared the crowd, because they were regarding him as a prophet.

\p
\v 6 But the birthday of Herod having come, the daughter of Herodias danced in the midst and pleased Herod,
\v 7 because of which he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked.

\v 8 Now she, having been urged beforehand by her mother, said, “Give me here, on a platter, the head of John the Baptist.”
\v 9 And the king was grieved, {but} because of the oaths and the ones reclining to eat with him, he commanded {it} to be given.

\v 10 And having sent, he beheaded John in the prison.
\v 11 And his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought {it} to her mother.
\v 12 And having approached, his disciples took away the corpse and buried him. And having come, they reported {this} to Jesus.

\p
\v 13 Now, having heard, Jesus withdrew from there in a boat to a desolate place by himself. And having heard, the crowds followed him on foot from the cities.
\v 14 And having come out, he saw a large crowd, and he had compassion on them and healed their sick.

\p
\v 15 Now evening having come, the disciples came to him, saying, “This place is desolate, and the hour has already passed by. Send the crowds away so that, having gone away to the villages, they might buy food for themselves.”

\p
\v 16 But Jesus said to them, “They have no need to go away. You give them to eat.”

\p
\v 17 But they say to him, “We have nothing here except five loaves and two fish.”

\p
\v 18 But he said, “Bring them here to me.”

\v 19 And having commanded the crowds to recline on the grass, having taken the five loaves and the two fish, having looked up to heaven, he blessed, and having broken {them}, he gave the loaves to the disciples, and the disciples to the crowds.
\v 20 And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up the remaining of the broken pieces—12 baskets full.
\v 21 Now the ones eating were about 5, 000 men, besides women and children.

\p
\v 22 And immediately he compelled the disciples to get into the boat and to go before him to the other side, while he sent the crowds away.
\v 23 And having sent the crowds away, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. Now, evening having come, he was there alone.
\v 24 But the boat was already in the middle of the sea\f + \ft Instead of \fq was already in the middle of the sea,\fq* some manuscripts read \fqa was already many stadia away from the land.\fqa*\f*, being tormented by the waves, for the wind was against {it}.

\v 25 Now in the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea.
\v 26 But the disciples, having seen him walking on the sea, were greatly troubled, saying, “It is a ghost,” and they cried out from fear.

\p
\v 27 But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, “Take courage! It is I! Do not be afraid.”

\p
\v 28 But, answering him, Peter said, “Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water.”

\p
\v 29 And he said, “Come.”
\p
And Peter, having gotten out from the boat, walked on the water to go to Jesus.
\v 30 But, seeing the strong wind, he became afraid, and having begun to sink, he cried out, saying, “Lord, save me!”

\p
\v 31 But immediately, Jesus, having stretched out his hand, took hold of him, and says to him, “You of little faith, why did you doubt?”

\p
\v 32 And {when} they had gotten into the boat, the wind ceased.
\v 33 And the ones in the boat worshiped him, saying, “Truly you are the Son of God.”

\p
\v 34 And having crossed over, they came to the land at Gennesaret.
\v 35 And having recognized him, the men of that place sent into all that surrounding area, and they brought to him all the ones having sickness.
\v 36 And they were begging him so that they might only touch the edge of his garment, and as many as touched {it} were healed.


\c 15
\p
\v 1 Then Pharisees and scribes come to Jesus from Jerusalem, saying,
\v 2 “Why do your disciples transgress the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat bread.”

\p
\v 3 But he, answering, said to them, “Why do you also transgress the commandment of God because of your tradition?

\v 4 For God commanded, saying\f + \ft Instead of \fq commanded, saying,\fq* some manuscripts read \fqa said.\fqa*\f*, ‘Honor your father and your mother,’ and ‘The one speaking evil of his father or mother, let him end in death.’
\v 5 But you say, ‘Whoever says to his father or mother, “Whatever you might have benefited from me {is} a gift,”
\v 6 he will certainly not honor his father.’ And you have set aside the word\f + \ft Instead of \fqa the word,\fqa* some manuscripts read, \fqa the commandment,\fqa* and other manuscripts read, \fqa the law.\fqa*\f*
of God because of your tradition.

\v 7 Hypocrites! Isaiah prophesied well about you, saying,
\q1 
\v 8 ‘This people honors me with their lips,
\q1
but their heart is far away from me.
\q1 
\v 9 But they worship me in vain,
\q1
teaching as doctrines commandments of men.’”

\p
\v 10 And having summoned the crowd, he said to them, “Listen and understand:
\v 11 What enters into the mouth does not defile the man, but what comes out from the mouth, this defiles the man.”

\p
\v 12 Then, having approached, the disciples said to him, “Do you know that the Pharisees, having heard this word, were caused to stumble?”

\p
\v 13 But he, answering, said, “Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be uprooted.
\v 14 Leave them! They are blind guides\f + \ft Some manuscripts add \fq of the blind\fq* here.\f*. But if a blind one guides a blind one, both will fall into a pit.”

\p
\v 15 But answering, Peter said to him, “Explain the parable to us.”

\p
\v 16 But he said, “Are you also still without understanding?
\v 17 Do you not yet understand that everything that enters into the mouth passes into the stomach and is passed out into the latrine?

\v 18 But the things coming out from the mouth come from the heart, and those defile the man.
\v 19 For from the heart come evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, sexual immoralities, thefts, false testimonies, blasphemies.
\v 20 These are the things defiling the man, but to eat with unwashed hands does not defile the man.”

\p
\v 21 And having come out from there, Jesus withdrew into the regions of Tyre and Sidon.
\v 22 And behold, a Canaanite woman, having come out from those regions, was crying out, saying, “Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is severely demon-possessed.”

\p
\v 23 But he did not answer her a word. And having approached, his disciples were begging him, saying, “Send her away, for she is crying out after us.”

\p
\v 24 But he, answering, said, “I was not sent, except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.”

\p
\v 25 But she, having come, bowed down to him, saying, “Lord, help me.”

\p
\v 26 Now he, answering, said, “It is not good to take the bread of the children and to throw {it} to the little dogs.”

\p
\v 27 But she said, “Yes, Lord, for also the little dogs eat from the crumbs falling from the table of their masters.”

\p
\v 28 Then answering, Jesus said to her, “O woman, great {is} your faith; let it be done for you just as you desire.” And her daughter was healed from that hour.

\p
\v 29 And having left from there, Jesus went along the Sea of Galilee, and having gone up on a mountain, he was sitting there.
\v 30 And large crowds approached him, having with them the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute, and many others. And they laid them at his feet, and he healed them,
\v 31 so that the crowd marveled, seeing the mute speaking, the crippled healthy, and the lame walking, and the blind seeing, and they glorified the God of Israel.

\p
\v 32 But Jesus, having summoned his disciples, said, “I have compassion on the crowd, because they are remaining with me already three days and do not have anything {that} they might eat. And I do not want to send them away hungry, lest they might faint on the way.”

\p
\v 33 And the disciples say to him, “From where {would be} to us in a desolate place so many loaves so as to satisfy so large a crowd?”

\p
\v 34 And Jesus says to them, “How many loaves do you have?”
\p
And they said, “Seven, and a few small fish.”

\p
\v 35 And having commanded the crowd to recline on the ground,

\v 36 he took the seven loaves and the fish, and having given thanks, he broke {them} and was giving {them} to the disciples, and the disciples to the crowds.
\v 37 And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up the remaining of the broken pieces—seven baskets full.
\v 38 But those eating were 4, 000 men, besides women and children.
\v 39 And having sent away the crowds, he got into the boat and went into the regions of Magadan\f + \ft Instead of \fq Magadan,\fq* some manuscripts read \fqa Magdala.\fqa*\f*.


\c 16
\p
\v 1 And the Pharisees and Sadducees, having approached, testing {him}, asked him to show them a sign from heaven.

\p
\v 2 But he answering said to them,\f + \ft Some ancient manuscripts include the following words here.\f*  “[Evening having come, you say, ‘It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.’

\v 3 \f + \ft Some ancient manuscripts include the following words here.\f*
And in early morning, ‘Today will be stormy, for the sky is red, being overcast.’ You know to interpret the face of the sky, but the signs of the times you are not able.]
\v 4 An evil and adulterous generation seeks a sign, but a sign will not be given to it except the sign of Jonah.” And having left them, he went away.

\p
\v 5 And the disciples, having come to the other side, forgot to take loaves.
\v 6 Now Jesus said to them, “See and guard from the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”

\p
\v 7 But they were reasoning among themselves, saying, “{It is} because we did not take loaves.”

\p
\v 8 But, having known this, Jesus said, “You of little faith, why are you reasoning among yourselves that you do not have loaves?

\v 9 Do you not yet perceive nor remember the five loaves of the 5, 000, and how many baskets you received?
\v 10 Nor the seven loaves of the 4, 000, and how many baskets you received?

\v 11 How do you not perceive that I did not speak to you about loaves? But guard from the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.”
\v 12 Then they understood that he had not told them to guard from the yeast of loaves, but from the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.

\p
\v 13 Now Jesus, having come to the regions of Caesarea Philippi, asked his disciples, saying, “Who do men say the Son of Man is?”

\p
\v 14 And they said, “Some, John the Baptist; and some, Elijah; and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.”

\p
\v 15 He says to them, “But who do you say I am?”

\p
\v 16 And answering, Simon Peter said, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.”

\p
\v 17 Now answering, Jesus said to him, “Blessed are you, Simon Bar Jonah, because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but my Father in the heavens.
\v 18 And I also say to you that you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it.

\v 19 I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens, and whatever you bind on the earth will have been bound in the heavens, and whatever you loose on the earth will have been loosed in the heavens.”
\v 20 Then he commanded the disciples that they tell no one that he is the Christ.

\p
\v 21 From that time Jesus Christ began to show to his disciples that it is necessary for him to go to Jerusalem and to suffer much from the elders and chief priests and scribes and to be killed and to be raised on the third day.
\v 22 And having taken him aside, Peter began to rebuke him, saying, “Merciful to you, Lord; this will certainly not be to you.”

\p
\v 23 But he, having turned, said to Peter, “Get behind me, Satan! You are a stumbling block to me, because you are not considering the things of God, but the things of men.”

\p
\v 24 Then Jesus said to his disciples, “If anyone wants to come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.
\v 25 For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.
\v 26 For what will a man benefit if he gains the whole world but forfeits his life? Or what will a man give in exchange for his life?

\v 27 For the Son of Man is about to come in the glory of his Father with his angels. And then he will repay each one according to his action.

\p
\v 28 Truly I say to you that there are some of the ones standing here who will certainly not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom.”


\c 17
\p
\v 1 And after six days, Jesus takes along Peter, and James, and John his brother, and brings them up onto a high mountain by themselves.
\v 2 And he was transfigured before them, and his face shone as the sun, and his garments became white as the light.

\v 3 And behold, Moses and Elijah were seen by them, talking with him.
\v 4 And answering, Peter said to Jesus, “Lord, it is good for us to be here. If you wish, I will make\f + \ft Instead of \fq I will make,\fq* some manuscripts read \fqa let us make.\fqa*\f*
here three tents, one for you, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah.”

\p
\v 5 {While} he was still speaking, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and behold, a voice from the cloud, saying, “This is my beloved Son with whom I am well pleased. Listen to him.”

\p
\v 6 And having heard, the disciples fell on their face and were very afraid.
\v 7 And Jesus approached and having touched them, said, “Get up and do not be afraid.”
\v 8 But, having lifted up their eyes, they saw no one except only Jesus himself.

\p
\v 9 And {as} they were coming down from the mountain, Jesus commanded them, saying, “Tell the vision to no one until the Son of Man might have risen from the dead.”

\p
\v 10 And his disciples questioned him, saying, “Why then do the scribes say that it is necessary for Elijah to come first?”

\p
\v 11 But he, answering, said, “Elijah indeed comes and will restore all things.
\v 12 But I say to you that Elijah already came, and they did not recognize him, but they did to him whatever they wanted. In the same way also, the Son of Man is about to suffer by them.”
\v 13 Then the disciples understood that he spoke to them about John the Baptist.

\p
\v 14 And having come to the crowd, a man approached him, kneeling before him
\v 15 and saying, “Lord, have mercy on my son, because he is epileptic and has sickness, for he often falls into the fire and often into the water.
\v 16 And I brought him to your disciples, and they were not able to heal him.”

\p
\v 17 But answering, Jesus said, “O unbelieving and perverted generation, until when will I be with you? Until when will I bear with you? Bring him here to me.”
\v 18 And Jesus rebuked it, and the demon came out from him, and the boy was healed from that hour.

\p
\v 19 Then the disciples, having approached Jesus privately, said, “For what reason were we not able to cast it out?”

\p
\v 20 And he says to them, “Because of your little faith. For truly I say to you, if you had faith like a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, ‘Move from here to there,’ and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you.
\v 21 \f + \ft Some ancient manuscripts include verse 21.\f*  [But this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.]”

\p
\v 22 Now they being gathered together in Galilee, Jesus said to them, “The Son of Man is about to be handed over into the hands of men,
\v 23 and they will kill him, and on the third day he will be raised up.” And they were very grieved.

\p
\v 24 Now {when} they had come to Capernaum, the ones collecting the two-drachma tax approached Peter and said, “Does not your teacher pay the two-drachma tax?”

\p
\v 25 He says, “Yes.”
\p
And having entered into the house, Jesus anticipated him, saying, “What do you think, Simon? The kings of the earth—from whom do they receive taxes or tolls? From their sons or from strangers?”

\p
\v 26 But having said, “From strangers,”
\p
Jesus said to him, “Therefore, the sons are free.
\v 27 But in order that we might not cause them to stumble, having gone to the sea, throw in a fishhook, and draw in the first fish having come up. And having opened its mouth, you will find a shekel. Having taken that, give {it} to them on behalf of me and you.”


\c 18
\p
\v 1 At that hour the disciples approached Jesus, saying, “Who then is greatest in the kingdom of the heavens?”

\p
\v 2 And having summoned a little child, he set him in the midst of them
\v 3 and said, “Truly I say to you, unless you turn and become like little children, you will certainly not enter into the kingdom of the heavens.

\v 4 Therefore, whoever will humble himself like this little child, he is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens.
\v 5 And whoever receives a little child like this in my name receives me.

\p
\v 6 But whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to stumble, it is better for him that a millstone of a donkey would have been hung around his neck and he would have been sunk into the depth of the sea.

\v 7 Woe to the world because of the stumbling blocks! For it is necessary that the stumbling blocks come, but woe to the man through whom the stumbling block comes!
\v 8 Now if your hand or your foot causes you to stumble, cut it off and throw {it} away from you. It is better for you to enter into life crippled or lame than, having two hands or two feet, to be thrown into the eternal fire.

\v 9 And if your eye causes you to stumble, pluck it out and throw {it} away from you. It is better for you to enter into life with one eye than, having two eyes, to be thrown into the Gehenna of fire.

\p
\v 10 See that you would not despise one of these little ones. For I say to you that in heaven their angels always look on the face of my Father in the heavens.
\v 11 \f + \ft Some ancient manuscripts include verse 11.\f*  [For the Son of Man came to save the one that has been lost.]

\v 12 What do you think? If a certain man has 100 sheep, and one of them goes astray, having left the 99 on the mountains and having gone, does he not seek the one having gone astray?
\v 13 And if he happens to find it, truly I say to you that he rejoices over it more than over the 99 that have not gone astray.
\v 14 In the same way, it is not the will before your Father\f + \ft Instead of \fq your Father,\fq* some manuscripts read \fqa my Father.\fqa*\f*
in the heavens that one of these little ones would perish.

\p
\v 15 But if your brother sins against you\f + \ft Some manuscripts do not include the phrase \fq against you\fq* here.\f*, go, reprove him between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother.
\v 16 But if he does not listen, take with you yet one or two {others}, so that ‘by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word might be verified.’

\v 17 But if he refuses to listen to them, speak to the church. But if he also refuses to listen to the church, let him be to you even as the Gentile and the tax collector.

\v 18 Truly I say to you, whatever you bind on the earth will be bound in heaven; and whatever you release on the earth will be released in heaven.
\v 19 Again, truly I say to you that if two of you agree together on the earth about any matter, whatever they might ask, it will be done for them by my Father in the heavens.
\v 20 For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there I am in their midst.”

\p
\v 21 Then, having approached, Peter said to him, “Lord, how often will my brother sin against me and I will forgive him? Until seven times?”

\p
\v 22 Jesus says to him, “I do not say to you up to seven times, but up to 77 times.

\v 23 For this reason, the kingdom of the heavens is compared to a man, a king, who wanted to take up a word together with his slaves.
\v 24 Now {when} he had begun to take up together, one debtor of 10, 000 talents was brought to him.
\v 25 But, he not being able to repay, the master commanded him to be sold, together with his wife and children and everything, as much as he had, and repayment to be made.

\p
\v 26 So, having fallen down, the slave was bowing down before him, saying, ‘Master, have patience with me, and I will repay you everything.’

\p
\v 27 Now, having had compassion, the master of that slave released him and forgave him the debt.

\v 28 But having gone out, that slave found one of his fellow slaves, who owed him 100 denarii, and having seized him, he choked {him}, saying, ‘Repay whatever you owe.’

\p
\v 29 So, having fallen down, his fellow slave begged him, saying, ‘Have patience with me, and I will repay you.’

\v 30 But he was not willing. Instead, having gone away, he threw him into prison until he might repay {what} is owed.

\p
\v 31 Therefore, his fellow slaves, having seen {what} had happened, were very grieved. And having come, they explained to their master everything that had happened.

\v 32 Then, having summoned him, his master says to him, ‘Wicked slave, I forgave you all that debt because you begged me.
\v 33 Was it not necessary for you also to have had mercy on your fellow slave, just as I also had mercy on you?’

\v 34 And having become angry, his master handed him over to the torturers until he would repay all that is owed.
\v 35 Thus also my heavenly Father will do to you, if each of you does not forgive his brother out of your hearts.”


\c 19
\p
\v 1 And it happened that when Jesus had finished these words, he departed from Galilee and came to the regions of Judea beyond the Jordan.
\v 2 And great crowds followed him, and he healed them there.

\p
\v 3 And Pharisees approached him, testing him, and saying whether it is lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason.

\p
\v 4 But he, answering, said, “Have you not read that the one having made {them} from the beginning ‘made them male and female,’
\v 5 and said, ‘Because of this, a man will leave his father and mother and will be joined to his wife, and the two will be one flesh’?

\v 6 So then, they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God joined together, let man not separate.”

\p
\v 7 They say to him, “Why then did Moses command {us} to give a certificate of divorce and to divorce her?”

\p
\v 8 He says to them, “Because of your hardness of heart, Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not that way.
\v 9 But I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery; and the one having married one that has been divorced commits adultery.”\f + \ft Some early manuscripts do not include the words \fqa and the one having married one that has been divorced commits adultery.\fqa*\f*

\p
\v 10 The disciples say to him, “If thus is the reason of the man with his wife, it is better not to marry.”

\p
\v 11 But he said to them, “Not all receive this word, but to whom it has been given.
\v 12 For there are eunuchs who were born thus from their mother’s womb, and there are eunuchs who were made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs because of the kingdom of the heavens. The one being able to receive {this}, let him receive {it}.”

\p
\v 13 Then little children were brought to him so that he would lay his hands on them and would pray, but the disciples rebuked them.
\v 14 But Jesus said, “Permit the little children, and do not forbid them to come to me, for of the ones such as these is the kingdom of the heavens.”
\v 15 And having laid his hands on them, he went from there.

\p
\v 16 And behold, one, having approached him, said, “Teacher, what good thing should I do in order that I might have eternal life?”

\p
\v 17 But he said to him, “Why do you ask me about {what is} good? One is good, but if you want to enter into life, keep the commandments.”

\p
\v 18 He says to him, “Which ones?”
\p
And Jesus said, “Do not kill, do not commit adultery, do not steal, do not testify falsely,
\v 19 honor your father and your mother, and love your neighbor as yourself.”

\p
\v 20 The young man says to him, “All these things I have kept. What do I still lack?”

\p
\v 21 Jesus said to him, “If you want to be perfect, go, sell your possessions, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in the heavens; and come, follow me.”
\v 22 But the young man, having heard the word, went away being grieved, for he was having many possessions.

\p
\v 23 Now Jesus said to his disciples, “Truly I say to you, a rich {person} will enter difficultly into the kingdom of the heavens.
\v 24 And again I say to you, it is easier for a camel to pass through an eye of a needle than for a rich {person} to enter into the kingdom of God.”

\p
\v 25 Now, having heard this, the disciples were very astonished, saying, “Then who is able to be saved?”

\p
\v 26 But Jesus, having looked at {them}, said to them, “With men this is impossible, but with God all things are possible.”

\p
\v 27 Then answering, Peter said to him, “Behold, we left everything and followed you. What then will there be for us?”

\p
\v 28 And Jesus said to them, “Truly I say to you that in the renewal when the Son of Man sits on his throne of glory, you, the ones having followed me, you also will sit upon 12 thrones, judging the 12 tribes of Israel.

\v 29 And everyone who has left houses, or brothers, or sisters, or a father, or a mother, or a wife,\f + \ft Some manuscripts do not include the phrase \fq or a wife\fq* here.\f*
or children, or lands for the sake of my name, will receive 100 times {as much} and will inherit eternal life.
\v 30 But many first will be last, and last, first.


\c 20
\p
\v 1 For the kingdom of the heavens is like a man, the master of the house, who went out with the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
\v 2 Now, having agreed with the workers for a denarius for the day, he sent them into his vineyard.

\v 3 And having gone out about the third hour, he saw others standing idle in the marketplace.
\v 4 And to them he said, ‘You also, go into the vineyard, and whatever is right I will give you.’

\v 5 So they went out. Having gone out again about the sixth and ninth hour, he did likewise.
\v 6 Now, having gone out about the eleventh {hour}, he found others standing, and he says to them, ‘Why have you stood here idle the whole day?’

\p
\v 7 They say to him, ‘Because no one hired us.’
\p
He says to them, ‘You also go into the vineyard.’

\p
\v 8 And evening having come, the owner of the vineyard says to his manager, ‘Call the workers and pay them their wages, having begun from the last to the first.’
\v 9 And having come, the ones about the eleventh hour each received a denarius.
\v 10 But having come, the first thought that they will receive more, but they also received a denarius each.

\p
\v 11 But, having received {it}, they were murmuring against the master of the house,
\v 12 saying, ‘These last ones have done one hour, but you made them equal to us, the ones having borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.’

\p
\v 13 But he, answering, said to one of them, ‘Friend, I am not wronging you. Did you not agree with me for a denarius?
\v 14 Take {what is} yours and go away. But I desire to give to this last as also to you.

\v 15 Or is it not lawful for me to do what I desire with {what is} mine? Or is your eye evil because I am good?’
\v 16 In the same way, the last will be first, and the first last.”\f + \ft Here, some ancient manuscripts include the words \fqa For many are called, but few are chosen.\fqa*\f*

\p
\v 17 And Jesus, going up to Jerusalem, took the 12 disciples aside by themselves, and on the way he said to them,
\v 18 “Behold, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death
\v 19 and hand him over to the Gentiles for them to mock and to whip and to crucify him. But on the third day he will be raised up.”

\p
\v 20 Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee approached him with her sons, bowing down and asking for something from him.
\v 21 And he said to her, “What do you desire?”
\p
She says to him, “Say that these two sons of mine might sit, one at your right hand and one at your left hand, in your kingdom.”

\p
\v 22 But answering, Jesus said, “You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am about to drink\f + \ft Here some manuscripts add the words \fq or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am being baptized.\fq*\f*?”
\p
They say to him, “We are able.”

\p
\v 23 He says to them, “My cup you will drink\f + \ft Here some manuscripts add the words \fq and you will be baptized with the baptism with which I am being baptized.\fq*\f*. But to sit at my right hand and at my left hand is not mine to give, but for whom it has been prepared by my Father.”

\p
\v 24 And having heard this, the ten were very angry with the two brothers.

\v 25 But Jesus, having summoned them, said, “You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and the great ones exercise authority over them.
\v 26 It is not this way among you. Instead, whoever desires to become great among you will be your servant,
\v 27 and whoever desires to be first among you will be your slave,
\v 28 just as the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom in exchange for many.”

\p
\v 29 And {as} they were going out from Jericho, a great crowd followed him.
\v 30 And behold, two blind men, sitting beside the road, having heard that Jesus is passing by, cried out, saying, “Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David.”

\p
\v 31 Now the crowd rebuked them, so that they would be silent, but they cried out even more, saying, “Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David.”

\p
\v 32 And having stood still, Jesus called them and said, “What do you desire {that} I might do for you?”

\p
\v 33 They say to him, “Lord, that our eyes might be opened.”
\v 34 Now, having had compassion, Jesus touched their eyes. And immediately they saw again, and they followed him.


\c 21
\p
\v 1 And when they came near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage, to the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples,
\v 2 saying to them, “Go into the village opposite you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied up, and a colt with her. Having untied {them}, bring {them} to me.
\v 3 And if anyone says anything to you, you will say, ‘The Lord has need of them,’ and immediately he will send them.”

\v 4 Now this happened so that {what} was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled, saying,
\q1 
\v 5 “Tell the daughter of Zion,
\q1
‘Behold, your King is coming to you,
\q1
humble and riding on a donkey,
\q1
and on a colt, a son of a beast of burden.’”

\p
\v 6 Now the disciples, having gone and having done just as Jesus had directed them,
\v 7 brought the donkey and the colt and put their cloaks on them, and he sat upon them.
\v 8 Now the largest crowd spread their cloaks on the road, and others were cutting branches from the trees and were spreading {them} on the road.

\v 9 Now the crowds going before him and following were crying out, saying,
\q1
“Hosanna to the Son of David!
\q1
Blessed is the one coming in the name of the Lord!
\q1
Hosanna in the highest!”
\p
\v 10 And {when} he had entered into Jerusalem, the whole city was shaken, saying, “Who is this?”

\p
\v 11 And the crowds were saying, “This is Jesus the prophet from Nazareth of Galilee.”

\p
\v 12 And Jesus entered into the temple and cast out all the ones selling and buying in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money changers and the seats of the ones selling the doves.
\v 13 And he says to them, “It has been written, ‘My house will be called a house of prayer,’ but you make it a ‘den of robbers.’”

\p
\v 14 And the blind and the lame approached him in the temple, and he healed them.

\v 15 But the chief priests and the scribes, having seen the marvelous things that he did and the children crying out in the temple and saying, “Hosanna to the Son of David,” became very angry.

\p
\v 16 And they said to him, “Do you hear what these are saying?”
\p
But Jesus says to them, “Yes! Have you never read,
\q1 ‘From the mouths of little children and nursing infants
\q1 you have prepared praise’?”

\p
\v 17 And having left them, he went out from the city to Bethany and spent the night there.

\p
\v 18 Now, in the morning, returning to the city, he was hungry.
\v 19 And having seen one fig tree along the road, he went to it and found nothing on it except leaves only. And he says to it, “May there no longer be fruit from you to eternity,” and immediately the fig tree withered.

\p
\v 20 And having seen this, the disciples marveled, saying, “How did the fig tree immediately wither?”

\p
\v 21 But, answering, Jesus said to them, “Truly I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do {what was} of the fig tree, but also if you say to this mountain, ‘Be taken up and be thrown into the sea,’ it will happen.
\v 22 And everything, as much as you request in prayer, believing, you will receive.”

\p
\v 23 And {when} he had come into the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people approached him teaching, saying, “By what authority do you do these things, and who gave you this authority?”

\p
\v 24 But answering, Jesus said to them, “I also will ask you one word, which if you tell me, I also will tell you by what authority I do these things.

\v 25 The baptism of John—from where was it? From heaven or from men?”
\p
But they were reasoning among themselves, saying, “If we say, ‘From heaven,’ he will say to us, ‘For what {reason} then did you not believe him?’
\v 26 But if we say, ‘From men,’ we fear the crowd, for they all regard John as a prophet.”

\p
\v 27 And answering Jesus, they said, “We do not know.”
\p
He also said to them, “Nor do I tell you by what authority I do these things.

\v 28 But what do you think? A man had two children, and having approached the first, he said, ‘Child, go, work today in the vineyard.’

\p
\v 29 But he, answering, said, ‘I will not,’ but afterward, having changed his mind, he went.

\p
\v 30 But, having approached the other, he said likewise.
\p
And he, answering, said, ‘I will, lord,’ but he did not go.

\p
\v 31 Which of the two did the will of his father?”
\p
They say, “The first.”
\p
Jesus says to them, “Truly I say to you that the tax collectors and the prostitutes enter into the kingdom of God before you.
\v 32 For John came to you in the way of righteousness, but you did not believe him. But the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. But you, having seen this, did not change your minds afterward to believe in him.

\p
\v 33 Listen to another parable. There was a man, a master of a house, who planted a vineyard and put a hedge around it and dug a winepress in it and built a watchtower and rented it out to farmers and went abroad.
\v 34 Now, when the time of the fruits came near, he sent his servants to the farmers to receive his fruits.

\v 35 But the farmers, having seized his servants, beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.
\v 36 Again, he sent other servants, more than the first, but they did to them likewise.
\v 37 But afterward, he sent to them his son, saying, ‘They will respect my son.’

\p
\v 38 But the farmers, having seen the son, said among themselves, ‘This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and have his inheritance.’
\v 39 And having seized him, they threw him out of the vineyard and killed {him}.

\v 40 Therefore, when the lord of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those farmers?”

\p
\v 41 They say to him, “He will severely destroy those evil ones, and he will rent out the vineyard to other farmers who will repay him the fruits in their times.”

\p
\v 42 Jesus says to them, “Did you never read in the Scriptures,
\q1
‘A stone that the builders rejected,
\q1
this has become the head of the corner.
\q1
This came about from the Lord,
\q1
and it is marvelous in our eyes’?

\m
\v 43 For this reason I say to you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and will be given to a nation producing its fruits.
\v 44 And the one having fallen on this stone will be broken to pieces, but on whomever it falls, it will crush him.”\f + \ft Some ancient manuscripts do not include this verse.\f*

\p
\v 45 And the chief priests and the Pharisees, having heard his parables, knew that he is speaking about them.
\v 46 And seeking to seize him, they feared the crowds, because they were regarding him as a prophet.


\c 22
\p
\v 1 And answering, Jesus again spoke to them in parables, saying,
\v 2 “The kingdom of the heavens is compared to a man, a king, who made a wedding feast for his son.
\v 3 And he sent out his servants to call the ones having been invited to the wedding feast, and they were not willing to come.

\v 4 Again he sent other servants, saying, ‘Say to the ones having been invited, “Behold, I have prepared my dinner. My bulls and fattened calves have been killed, and all things are ready. Come to the wedding feast.”’

\v 5 But they, having paid no attention, went away, one to his own field and one to his business.
\v 6 But the rest, having seized his servants, mistreated and killed {them}.
\v 7 But the king became angry, and having sent his soldiers, he destroyed those murderers and burned their city.

\v 8 Then he says to his servants, ‘The wedding feast is ready, but the ones having been invited were not worthy.
\v 9 Therefore, go to the crossings of the roads and invite as many as you find to the wedding feast.’
\v 10 And those servants, having gone out to the roads, gathered together all whom they found, both evil and good, and the wedding was filled {with those} reclining to eat.

\v 11 But the king, having come in to look at the ones reclining to eat, saw there a man not wearing wedding clothes.
\v 12 And he says to him, ‘Friend, how did you come in here, not having wedding clothes?’ But he was silent.

\v 13 Then the king said to the servants, ‘Having bound his feet and hands, throw him out into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and grinding of the teeth.’
\v 14 For many are called, but few chosen.”

\p
\v 15 Then, having gone, the Pharisees took counsel how they might entrap him in word.
\v 16 And they send to him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, “Teacher, we know that you are truthful, and you teach the way of God in truth, and it is not a concern to you about anyone, for you do not look at the face of men.
\v 17 Therefore, tell us, what do you think? Is it lawful to give a poll tax to Caesar, or not?”

\p
\v 18 But Jesus, having known their wickedness, said, “Why are you testing me, hypocrites?
\v 19 Show me the coin of the poll tax.” And they brought a denarius to him.

\p
\v 20 And he says to them, “Whose image and inscription {is} this?”

\p
\v 21 They say, “Caesar’s.”
\p
Then he says to them, “Therefore, give back the things of Caesar to Caesar, and the things of God to God.”
\v 22 And having heard {it}, they marveled, and having left him, they went away.

\p
\v 23 On that day Sadducees, saying there is no resurrection, approached him and questioned him,
\v 24 saying, “Teacher, Moses said, ‘If someone dies, not having children, his brother will marry his wife and will raise up seed for his brother.’

\v 25 But there were among us seven brothers, and the first, having married, died. And not having seed, he left his wife to his brother.
\v 26 Likewise also, the second and the third, until the seven.
\v 27 And last of all, the woman died.
\v 28 Therefore, in the resurrection, of which of the seven will she be a wife? For they all had her.”

\p
\v 29 But answering, Jesus said to them, “You are being led astray, not knowing the Scriptures or the power of God.
\v 30 For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but they are like angels in heaven.

\v 31 But concerning the resurrection of the dead, have you not read {what} was spoken to you by God, saying,
\v 32 ‘I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob’? He is not a God of the dead, but of the living.”
\v 33 And having heard this, the crowds were astonished at his teaching.

\p
\v 34 But the Pharisees, having heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, gathered together at the same place.
\v 35 And one of them, a lawyer, questioned {him}, testing him—
\v 36 “Teacher, which {is} the great commandment in the law?”

\p
\v 37 But he said to him, “You will love the Lord your God with your whole heart, and with your whole soul, and with your whole mind.
\v 38 This is the great and first commandment.

\v 39 Now a second {is} like it—‘You will love your neighbor as yourself.’
\v 40 On these two commandments are hung the whole Law and the Prophets.”

\p
\v 41 Now the Pharisees having been gathered together, Jesus questioned them,
\v 42 saying, “What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?”
\p
They say to him, “David’s.”

\p
\v 43 He says to them, “How then does David in the Spirit call him ‘Lord,’ saying,
\q1 
\v 44 ‘The Lord said to my Lord,
\q1
“Sit at my right hand,
\q1
until I put your enemies under your feet”’?

\m
\v 45 If David therefore calls him ‘Lord,’ how is he his son?”
\v 46 And no one was able to answer him a word, nor did anyone dare from that day to question him any longer.


\c 23
\p
\v 1 Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to his disciples,
\v 2 saying, “The scribes and the Pharisees sat in the seat of Moses.
\v 3 Therefore, everything, as much as they say to you, do and keep. But do not do according to their works, for they say and do not do.

\v 4 And they tie up loads, heavy and difficult to carry, and they put {them} on the shoulders of men, but they themselves are not willing with their finger to move them.
\v 5 But they do all their deeds to be seen by men. For they broaden their phylacteries and they lengthen their tassels.

\v 6 And they love the first places at the banquets and the first seats in the synagogues,
\v 7 and the greetings in the marketplaces, and to be called ‘Rabbi’ by men.

\v 8 But you should not be called ‘Rabbi,’ for one is your teacher, and you are all brothers.
\v 9 And you should not call {anyone} on the earth your father, for one is your heavenly Father.
\v 10 And you should not be called ‘teacher,’ for your teacher is one, the Christ.

\v 11 But the greatest among you will be your servant.
\v 12 But whoever will exalt himself will be humbled, and whoever will humble himself will be exalted.

\p
\v 13 But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut the kingdom of the heavens in front of men. For you do not enter in, nor do you permit the ones entering to enter.

\p
\v 14 \f + \ft Many ancient manuscripts do not include this verse.\f*  [But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour the houses of widows, also for a pretext praying at length. For this reason, you will receive greater judgment.]

\p
\v 15 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you go around the sea and the dry land to make one proselyte, and when he becomes {one}, you make him twice as much a son of Gehenna as you.

\p
\v 16 Woe to you, blind guides, the ones saying, ‘Whoever swears by the temple, it is nothing. But whoever swears by the gold of the temple, he is obligated.’
\v 17 Foolish and blind! For which is greater, the gold or the temple having sanctified the gold?

\v 18 And, ‘Whoever swears by the altar, it is nothing. But whoever swears by the gift on top of it, he is obligated.’
\v 19 Foolish and blind! For which {is} greater, the gift or the altar sanctifying the gift?

\v 20 Therefore, the one having sworn by the altar swears by it and by everything {that is} on top of it.
\v 21 And the one having sworn by the temple swears by it and by the one inhabiting it.
\v 22 And the one having sworn by heaven swears by the throne of God and by the one sitting on it.

\p
\v 23 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe the mint and the dill and the cumin, but you have neglected the weightier {things} of the law—justice and mercy and faith. But it was necessary to do these and those not to neglect.
\v 24 Blind guides, the ones straining out the gnat but swallowing the camel!

\p
\v 25 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and of the plate, but inside they are full of greed and lack of self-control.
\v 26 Blind Pharisee! Clean first the inside of the cup and of the plate, so that the outside of them might become clean also.

\p
\v 27 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which on the outside appear beautiful, but on the inside are full of bones of the dead and all uncleanness.
\v 28 In the same way, you also on the outside appear righteous to men, but on the inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.

\p
\v 29 Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the tombs of the righteous.
\v 30 And you say, ‘If we were in the days of our fathers, we would not have been sharers with them in the blood of the prophets.’
\v 31 Therefore you testify against yourselves that you are sons of the ones having killed the prophets.

\v 32 And you, fill up the measure of your fathers!

\p
\v 33 Serpents, offspring of vipers, how might you escape from the judgment of Gehenna?

\v 34 For this reason, behold, I am sending to you prophets and wise {ones} and scribes. From them you will kill and crucify, and from them you will whip in your synagogues and pursue from city to city,
\v 35 so that might come upon you all the righteous blood being shed on the earth, from the blood of Abel the righteous to the blood of Zechariah son of Barachiah, whom you killed between the temple and the altar.
\v 36 Truly I say to you, all these things will come upon this generation.

\p
\v 37 Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the one killing the prophets and stoning the ones having been sent to her! How often I desired to gather your children the way a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were not willing!
\v 38 Behold, your house is left to you desolate.
\v 39 For I say to you, you will certainly not see me from now until you say, ‘Blessed is the one coming in the name of the Lord!’”


\c 24
\p
\v 1 And Jesus, having gone out from the temple, was going away. And his disciples approached {him} to show him the buildings of the temple.
\v 2 But he, answering, said to them, “Do you not see all these things? Truly I say to you, a stone upon a stone will certainly not be left here, which will not be torn down.”

\p
\v 3 Now {as} he was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples approached him by themselves, saying, “Tell us, when will these things be? And what {is} the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?”

\p
\v 4 And answering, Jesus said to them, “Be careful that no one leads you astray.
\v 5 For many will come in my name, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and they will lead many astray.

\v 6 And you are going to hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not troubled, for it is necessary {for this} to happen, but the end is not yet.
\v 7 For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines\f + \ft Some manuscripts add the phrase \fq and plagues\fq* here.\f*
and earthquakes in various places.
\v 8 But all these things {are} the beginning of birth pains.

\p
\v 9 Then they will hand you over to tribulation and will kill you, and you will be hated by all the nations because of my name.
\v 10 And then many will be caused to stumble and will hand one another over and will hate one another.
\v 11 And many false prophets will be raised up and will lead many astray.

\v 12 And because lawlessness will be increased, the love of many will grow cold.
\v 13 But the one having endured to the end, this one will be saved.
\v 14 And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole world for a testimony to all the nations, and then the end will come.

\p
\v 15 Therefore, when you see the abomination of desolation having been spoken of by Daniel the prophet standing in the holy place” (let the one reading understand),
\v 16 “then let the ones in Judea flee to the mountains,
\v 17 let the one on the housetop not go down to take anything from his house,
\v 18 and let the one in the field not turn back to take his cloak.

\v 19 But woe to the ones having in the womb and to the ones nursing in those days!
\v 20 But pray that your flight might not happen in winter nor on a Sabbath.
\v 21 For then will be great tribulation, such as has not happened from the beginning of the world until now, nor will ever happen.
\v 22 And if those days had not been shortened, no flesh would be saved. But because of the elect, those days will be shortened.

\p
\v 23 Then if anyone says to you, ‘Behold, here {is} the Christ!’ or, ‘Here!’ you should not believe {it};
\v 24 for false Christs and false prophets will be raised up and will give great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect.
\v 25 Behold, I have told you beforehand.

\v 26 Therefore, if they say to you, ‘Behold, he is in the wilderness,’ you should not go out; ‘Behold, in the inner chambers,’ you should not believe {it}.
\v 27 For, just as the lightning comes out from the east and shines as far as the west, thus will be the coming of the Son of Man.
\v 28 Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will be gathered.

\p
\v 29 But immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.

\v 30 And then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn. And they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and much glory.
\v 31 And he will send his angels with a great trumpet, and they will gather together his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the heavens to the ends of them.

\p
\v 32 Now learn the parable from the fig tree: When its branch already becomes tender and it puts out leaves, you know that the summer {is} near.
\v 33 Thus also you, when you see all these things, know that it is near, at the doors.

\v 34 Truly I say to you that this generation will certainly not pass away until all these things happen.
\v 35 The heaven and the earth will pass away, but my words will certainly not pass away.

\p
\v 36 But concerning that day and hour no one knows, neither the angels of the heavens, nor the Son,\f + \ft Some manuscripts do not include the phrase \fq nor the Son\fq* here.\f*
except the Father only.

\v 37 For just as the days of Noah, thus will be the coming of the Son of Man.
\v 38 For as in the days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until that day Noah entered into the ark,
\v 39 and they did not know until the flood came and took {them} all away, thus also will be the coming of the Son of Man.

\v 40 Then two will be in the field—one is taken, and one is left.
\v 41 Two grinding with the mill—one is taken, and one is left.

\p
\v 42 Therefore, be alert, for you do not know on what day your Lord will come.

\v 43 But know this, that if the master of the house had known in which watch the thief comes, he would have been alert and would not have allowed his house to be broken into.
\v 44 For this reason you also be ready, because in that hour you do not think, the Son of Man comes.

\p
\v 45 Who then is the faithful and wise slave whom the master has appointed over his household to give them their food in time?
\v 46 Blessed {is} that slave whom his master, having come, will find doing thus.
\v 47 Truly I say to you that he will appoint him over all his possessions.

\v 48 But if that evil slave says in his heart, ‘My master delays,’
\v 49 and he begins to beat his fellow slaves and eats and drinks with the ones being drunk,
\v 50 the master of that slave will come on a day that he does not expect and at an hour that he does not know,
\v 51 and he will cut him in two and appoint his place with the hypocrites, where there will be weeping and grinding of the teeth.


\c 25
\p
\v 1 Then the kingdom of the heavens will be compared to ten virgins who, having taken their lamps, went out to a meeting of the bridegroom.
\v 2 Now five of them were foolish and five wise.
\v 3 For the foolish, having taken their lamps, did not take oil with them.
\v 4 But the wise took oil in the containers with their lamps.

\v 5 But the bridegroom delaying, they all became sleepy and were sleeping.
\v 6 But in the middle of the night there was a cry, ‘Behold, the bridegroom! Go out to the meeting.’

\v 7 Then all those virgins got up and put their lamps in order.

\p
\v 8 Now the foolish said to the wise, ‘Give us from your oil, because our lamps are going out.’

\p
\v 9 But the wise answered, saying, ‘Lest there not be enough for us and for you, go instead to the ones selling, and buy for yourselves.’

\v 10 But, they going away to buy, the bridegroom came, and the prepared entered with him into the wedding feast, and the door was shut.

\p
\v 11 But afterward also the rest of the virgins come, saying, ‘Lord, lord, open for us!’

\p
\v 12 But he, answering, said, ‘Truly I say to you, I do not know you.’
\v 13 Therefore, be alert, for you do not know the day nor the hour\f + \ft Some manuscripts include the clause \fq in which the Son of Man comes\fq* here.\f*.

\p
\v 14 For {it is} as if a man, going abroad, called his own slaves and handed over to them his possessions.
\v 15 And to one he gave five talents, and to one, two, and to one, one—to each according to his own ability. And immediately he went abroad.
\v 16 Having gone, the one having received the five talents traded with them and gained another five talents.

\v 17 Likewise, the one with the two also gained another two.
\v 18 But the one having received the one, having gone away, dug in the ground and hid the money of his master.

\v 19 Now after a long time, the master of those slaves comes and takes up a word together with them.
\v 20 And having approached, the one having received the five talents brought another five talents, saying, ‘Master, you handed over to me five talents; behold, I gained another five talents.’

\p
\v 21 His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful slave! You were faithful over a few things. I will appoint you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.’

\p
\v 22 Having approached, also the one with the two talents said, ‘Master, you handed over to me two talents; behold, I gained another two talents.’

\p
\v 23 His master said to him, ‘Well done, good and faithful slave! You were faithful over a few things. I will appoint you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.’

\p
\v 24 But having approached, also the one having received the one talent said, ‘Master, I knew you, that you are a harsh man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter.
\v 25 And having become afraid, having gone away, I hid your talent in the ground. Behold, you have {what is} yours.’

\p
\v 26 But answering, his master said to him, ‘Wicked and lazy slave! Did you know that I reap where I did not sow and gather where I did not scatter?
\v 27 Therefore, it was necessary for you to have put my money with the bankers, and having come, I would have received back {what is} mine with interest.

\p
\v 28 Therefore, take away the talent from him and give it to the one having the ten talents.
\v 29 For to everyone having, it will be given and it will abound. But from the one not having, even what he has will be taken away from him.
\v 30 And throw the worthless slave out into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and grinding of the teeth.’

\p
\v 31 Now, when the Son of Man comes in his glory and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his throne of glory.
\v 32 And before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate them from one another, just as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats.
\v 33 And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on his left.

\v 34 Then the King will say to the ones on his right, ‘Come, the ones having been blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world.
\v 35 For I was hungry, and you gave me to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me to drink; I was a stranger, and you gathered together with me;
\v 36 {I was} naked, and you clothed me; I was sick, and you cared for me; I was in prison, and you came to me.’

\p
\v 37 Then the righteous will answer him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you being hungry and feed {you}? Or being thirsty and give {you} to drink?
\v 38 And when did we see you a stranger and gather together with {you}? Or naked and clothe {you}?
\v 39 And when did we see you sick or in prison and come to you?’

\p
\v 40 And answering, the King will say to them, ‘Truly I say to you, as much as you did for one of the least of these brothers of mine, you did for me.’

\p
\v 41 Then he will say also to the ones on his left, ‘Go from me, the ones having been cursed, into the eternal fire that has been prepared for the devil and his angels.
\v 42 For I was hungry, and you did not give me to eat; I was thirsty, and you did not give me to drink;
\v 43 I was a stranger, and you did not gather together with me; {I was} naked, and you did not clothe me; {I was} sick and in prison, and you did not care for me.’

\p
\v 44 Then they also will answer, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry, or thirsty, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not serve you?’

\p
\v 45 Then he will answer them, saying, ‘Truly I say to you, as much as you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.’

\p
\v 46 And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”


\c 26
\p
\v 1 And it happened that when Jesus had finished all these words, he said to his disciples,
\v 2 “You know that after two days the Passover happens, and the Son of Man is handed over to be crucified.”

\p
\v 3 Then the chief priests and the elders of the people were gathered together in the courtyard of the chief priest, the one called Caiaphas.
\v 4 And they took counsel together in order that they might seize Jesus by deceit and kill him.
\v 5 But they were saying, “Not during the festival, so that a riot does not happen among the people.”

\p
\v 6 Now, Jesus being in Bethany in the house of Simon the leper,
\v 7 a woman approached him having an alabaster jar of very expensive perfumed oil, and she poured {it} upon his head, {he} reclining to eat.
\v 8 Now, having seen this, the disciples became very angry, saying, “For what {is} this waste?
\v 9 For this was able to be sold for much and given to the poor.”

\p
\v 10 But Jesus, knowing this, said to them, “Why are you causing trouble for the woman? For she did a good work for me.
\v 11 For you always have the poor with you, but you do not always have me.

\v 12 For she, putting this perfumed oil on my body, did {it} to prepare me for burial.
\v 13 Truly I say to you, wherever this gospel is preached in the whole world, also what she did will be spoken in remembrance of her.”

\p
\v 14 Then one of the Twelve, the one called Judas Iscariot, having gone to the chief priests,
\v 15 said, “What are you willing to give me, and I will hand him over to you?” And they weighed out 30 pieces of silver for him.
\v 16 And from then he was seeking an opportunity in order that he might hand him over.

\p
\v 17 Now on the first of the Festival of Unleavened Bread the disciples approached Jesus, saying, “Where do you want {that} we might prepare for you to eat the Passover?”

\p
\v 18 And he said, “Go into the city to so-and-so and say to him, ‘The Teacher says, “My time is near. I with my disciples am doing the Passover with you.”’”
\v 19 And the disciples did as Jesus directed them, and they prepared the Passover.

\p
\v 20 Now evening having come, he was reclining to eat with the Twelve.
\v 21 And they eating, he said, “Truly I say to you that one of you will hand me over.”

\p
\v 22 And being very grieved, each one began to say to him, “Surely not I, Lord?”

\p
\v 23 But he, answering, said, “The one having dipped his hand with me in the bowl, this one will hand me over.
\v 24 The Son of Man departs just as it has been written about him. But woe to that man through whom the Son of Man is handed over! It would have been good for him if that man had not been born.”

\p
\v 25 But answering, Judas, the one handing him over, said, “Surely not I, Rabbi?”
\p
He says to him, “You said {it}.”

\p
\v 26 Now they eating, Jesus, having taken bread and having blessed, broke {it}. And having given {it} to the disciples, he said, “Take, eat. This is my body.”

\v 27 And having taken a cup and having given thanks, he gave {it} to them, saying, “Drink from it, all of you.
\v 28 For this is my blood of the\f + \ft Some manuscripts add the word \fq new\fq* here.\f*
covenant that is being poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins.
\v 29 But I say to you, I will certainly not drink from now from this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in the kingdom of my Father.”

\p
\v 30 And having sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives.

\p
\v 31 Then Jesus says to them, “You all will be caused to stumble on me in this night, for it is written,
\q1
‘I will strike the shepherd
\q1
and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’
\m
\v 32 But after I am raised up, I will go before you into Galilee.”

\p
\v 33 But answering, Peter said to him, “If all will be caused to stumble on you, I never will be caused to stumble.”

\p
\v 34 Jesus said to him, “Truly I say to you that in this night, before a rooster crows, you will deny me three times.”

\p
\v 35 Peter says to him, “Even if it were necessary for me to die with you, I will certainly not deny you.” All the disciples also said likewise.

\p
\v 36 Then Jesus comes with them to a place called Gethsemane and says to the disciples, “Sit here while, having gone away there, I pray.”
\v 37 And having taken along Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be grieved and greatly troubled.
\v 38 Then he says to them, “My soul is very grieved—unto death. Remain here and be alert with me.”

\v 39 And having gone a little farther, he fell on his face, praying and saying, “My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass away from me. Yet, not as I will, but as you.”

\p
\v 40 And he comes to the disciples and finds them sleeping, and he says to Peter, “So, were you not able to be alert with me for one hour?
\v 41 Be alert and pray so that you do not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed {is} willing, but the flesh {is} weak.”

\v 42 Again, having gone away a second time, he prayed, saying, “My Father, if this is not able to pass away unless I drink it, let your will be done.”

\p
\v 43 And having come again, he found them sleeping, for their eyes were weighed down.
\v 44 And having left them again, having gone away, he prayed a third time, having said the same word again.

\v 45 Then he comes to the disciples and says to them, “Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour has come near, and the Son of Man is handed over into the hands of sinners.
\v 46 Get up, let us go. Behold, the one handing me over has come near.”

\p
\v 47 And he still speaking, behold, Judas, one of the Twelve, came, and with him a large crowd with swords and clubs from the chief priests and elders of the people.
\v 48 Now the one handing him over gave them a sign, saying, “Whomever I kiss is he. Seize him.”

\p
\v 49 And immediately, having approached Jesus, he said, “Rejoice, Rabbi!” and he kissed him.

\p
\v 50 But Jesus said to him, “Friend, for what are you present?”
\p
Then, having approached, they laid hands on Jesus and seized him.

\v 51 And behold, one of the ones with Jesus, having stretched out his hand, drew his sword, and having struck the servant of the high priest, cut off his ear.
\v 52 Then Jesus says to him, “Return your sword to its place, for all the ones having taken a sword will perish by a sword.
\v 53 Or do you think that I am not able to beg my Father, and he will provide me now with more than 12 legions of angels?
\v 54 How then would the scriptures be fulfilled, that it is necessary to happen in this way?”

\p
\v 55 At that hour Jesus said to the crowds, “As against a robber have you come out with swords and clubs to seize me? Every day I was sitting in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me.
\v 56 But all this has happened so that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled.” Then all the disciples, having left him, fled.

\p
\v 57 Now the ones having seized Jesus led {him} away to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders were gathered together.
\v 58 But Peter was following him from a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest. And having entered inside, he was sitting down with the officers to see the end.

\v 59 Now the chief priests and the entire Sanhedrin were seeking false testimony against Jesus so that they might put him to death.
\v 60 And they did not find {any}, many false witnesses having approached. But later two, having approached,
\v 61 said, “This one said, ‘I am able to destroy the temple of God and to rebuild {it} in three days.’”

\p
\v 62 And having stood up, the high priest said to him, “Do you answer nothing? What are these testifying against you?”
\v 63 But Jesus was silent. And the high priest said to him, “I make you swear by the living God that you tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God.”

\p
\v 64 Jesus says to him, “You said {it}. But I say to you, from now you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of power and coming on the clouds of heaven.”

\p
\v 65 Then the high priest tore his robes, saying, “He has blasphemed! Why do we still have need of witnesses? Behold, now you have heard the blasphemy.
\v 66 What do you think?”
\p
And they, answering, said, “He is deserving of death.”

\p
\v 67 Then they spit in his face and beat him. And they slapped him,
\v 68 saying, “Prophesy to us, Christ. Who is the one having hit you?”

\p
\v 69 Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard, and one servant girl approached him, saying, “You also were with Jesus of Galilee.”

\p
\v 70 But he denied {it} before all, saying, “I do not know what you are saying.”

\p
\v 71 But {he} having gone out to the gateway, another saw him and says to the ones there, “This one was with Jesus the Nazarene.”

\p
\v 72 And again he denied {it} with an oath, “I do not know the man!”

\p
\v 73 But after a little {while} the ones standing {there}, having approached, said to Peter, “Truly you also are from them, for also your speech makes you evident.”

\p
\v 74 Then he began to curse and to swear, “I do not know the man!” And immediately a rooster crowed.
\v 75 And Peter remembered the word of Jesus that he had said: “Before a rooster crows you will deny me three times.” And having gone outside, he wept bitterly.


\c 27
\p
\v 1 Now morning having come, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus so as to put him to death.
\v 2 And having bound him, they led {him} away and handed {him} over to Pilate the governor.

\p
\v 3 Then Judas, the one handing him over, having seen that he was condemned, having repented, returned the 30 pieces of silver to the chief priests and elders,
\v 4 saying, “I have sinned, having handed over innocent blood.”
\p
But they said, “What {is that} to us? You will see.”

\p
\v 5 And having thrown the pieces of silver into the temple, he withdrew. And having gone out, he hanged himself.

\p
\v 6 Now the chief priests, having taken the pieces of silver, said, “It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, because it is the price of blood.”

\p
\v 7 But, having taken counsel, they bought with them the field of the potter for burial for strangers.
\v 8 Therefore, that field has been called Field of Blood to this day.

\v 9 Then was fulfilled {what} was spoken through Jeremiah the prophet, saying,
\pmo “And they took the 30 pieces of silver, the price of the one having been priced, whom they from the sons of Israel priced,
\v 10 and they gave them for the field of the potter, just as the Lord directed me.”

\pmc
\v 11 Now Jesus was stood before the governor, and the governor questioned him, saying, “Are you the King of the Jews?”
\p
But Jesus said to him, “You say {it}.”
\p
\v 12 And when he was accused by the chief priests and the elders, he answered nothing.
\v 13 Then Pilate says to him, “Do you not hear how many things they are testifying against you?”
\v 14 And he did not answer him, not even to one word, so as to amaze the governor very much.

\p
\v 15 Now at the festival the governor had been accustomed to release to the crowd one prisoner whom they were wishing.
\v 16 Now at that time they were holding a well-known prisoner named Barabbas\f + \ft Instead of \fq Barabbas,\fq* some manuscripts read \fqa Jesus Barabbas.\fqa*\f*.

\v 17 Therefore, they being gathered together, Pilate said to them, “Whom do you want {that} I would release to you? Barabbas\f + \ft Instead of \fq Barabbas,\fq* some manuscripts read \fqa Jesus Barabbas.\fqa*\f*, or Jesus, the one called Christ?”
\v 18 For he knew that they handed him over because of envy.

\p
\v 19 Now, he sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent to him, saying, “Nothing to you and to that righteous one, for I suffered many {things} today because of him by means of a dream.”

\p
\v 20 But the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowds so that they would ask for Barabbas but would destroy Jesus.
\v 21 But answering, the governor said to them, “Whom from the two do you want {that} I would release to you?”
\p
But they said, “Barabbas.”

\p
\v 22 Pilate says to them, “What then should I do with Jesus, the one called Christ?”
\p
They all say, “Let him be crucified.”

\p
\v 23 But he said, “For what evil did he do?”
\p
But they were crying out even more, saying, “Let him be crucified.”

\p
\v 24 But Pilate, having seen that he is benefiting nothing, but, instead, a riot is happening, having taken water, washed his hands opposite the crowd, saying, “I am innocent from the blood of this one\f + \ft Instead of \fq this one,\fq* some manuscripts read \fqa this righteous one.\fqa*\f*. You will see.”

\p
\v 25 And answering, all the people said, “His blood {be} on us and on our children!”
\v 26 Then he released Barabbas to them, but having flogged Jesus, he handed {him} over so that he might be crucified.

\p
\v 27 Then the soldiers of the governor, having taken Jesus into the Praetorium, gathered together to him the whole cohort.
\v 28 And having stripped him, they placed a scarlet cloak on him.
\v 29 And having woven together a crown of thorns, they put {it} on his head and a reed in his right hand, and having knelt down before him, they mocked him, saying, “Rejoice, King of the Jews!”

\v 30 And having spat on him, they took the reed and were striking {him} on his head.
\v 31 And when they had mocked him, they took the cloak off him and put his robes on him and led him away to crucify {him}.

\p
\v 32 Now coming out, they found a Cyrenean man, Simon by name. They pressed this one into service so that he would carry his cross.
\v 33 And having come to a place called Golgotha, which is called Place of a Skull,
\v 34 they gave him wine mixed with gall to drink. And having tasted {it}, he was not willing to drink {it}.

\v 35 Now, having crucified him, they divided up his robes, casting a lot,\f + \ft Here some manuscripts include the following words: \fq so that what was spoken through the prophet might be fulfilled, “They divided my robes for themselves, and they cast a lot for my clothing.”\fq*\f*
\v 36 and sitting down, they were guarding him there.
\v 37 And they put above his head his charge, having been written, “This is Jesus, the King of the Jews.”

\p
\v 38 Then two robbers are being crucified with him, one at his right and one at his left.
\v 39 But the ones passing by were blaspheming him, wagging their heads
\v 40 and saying, “The one destroying the temple and in three days rebuilding {it}, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, also come down from the cross!”

\p
\v 41 Likewise also the chief priests, mocking {him} with the scribes and elders, were saying,
\v 42 “He saved others; he is not able to save himself. He is the King of Israel! Let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him.

\v 43 He has trusted in God; let him deliver {him} now, if he wants him. For he said, ‘I am the Son of God.’”
\v 44 But also the robbers having being crucified with him were reviling him the same.

\p
\v 45 Now from the sixth hour, darkness happened over all the land until the ninth hour.
\v 46 But about the ninth hour, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, “Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?” This is, “My God, my God, why did you forsake me?”

\p
\v 47 But some of the ones having stood there, having heard {it}, were saying, “This one calls Elijah.”

\v 48 And immediately one of them, having run and having taken a sponge, having both filled {it} with vinegar and put {it} around a reed, gave {it} to him to drink.

\p
\v 49 But the rest were saying, “Leave {him}! Let us see if Elijah comes, saving him.”
\v 50 But Jesus, having cried out again with a loud voice, released his spirit.

\v 51 And behold, the curtain of the temple was split in two from top to bottom, and the earth was shaken, and the rocks were split.
\v 52 And the tombs were opened, and many bodies of the saints having fallen asleep were raised.
\v 53 And having come out from the tombs after his resurrection, they entered into the holy city and appeared to many.

\p
\v 54 Now the centurion and the ones with him guarding Jesus, having seen the earthquake and the things having happened, were very afraid, saying, “Truly this was a Son of God.”

\p
\v 55 Now there were many women there, watching from a distance, who followed Jesus from Galilee, serving him.
\v 56 Among them were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the sons of Zebedee.

\p
\v 57 Now evening having come, a rich man from Arimathea came, Joseph by name, who also himself was discipled by Jesus.
\v 58 This one, having approached Pilate, asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate commanded {it} to be given {to him}.

\v 59 And Joseph, having taken the body, wrapped it in a clean linen cloth,
\v 60 and put it in his own new tomb, which he had cut in the rock. And having rolled a large stone against the door of the tomb, he went away.
\v 61 Now Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb.

\p
\v 62 Now the next day, which is after the Day of Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees were gathered together to Pilate,
\v 63 saying, “Lord, we remember that that deceiver said, still living, ‘After three days I am being raised up.’
\v 64 Therefore, command the tomb to be secured until the third day, lest his disciples, having come, might steal him and say to the people, ‘He has been raised up from the dead,’ and the last deception will be worse than the first.”

\p
\v 65 And Pilate said to them, “You have a guard. Go, secure {it} as you know.”
\v 66 And they, having gone, secured the tomb, having sealed the stone, with the guard.

\c 28
\p
\v 1 Now after the Sabbath, at the dawning on the first of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to watch the tomb.
\v 2 And behold, a great earthquake happened, for an angel of the Lord, having come down from heaven and having approached, rolled away the stone and was sitting on it.

\v 3 Now his appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow.
\v 4 And the ones guarding were shaken from the fear of him and became as dead.

\p
\v 5 But answering, the angel said to the women, “You, do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus, the one having been crucified.
\v 6 He is not here, for he was raised up, just as he said. Come, see the place where he was lying.
\v 7 And having gone quickly, say to his disciples, ‘He has been raised up from the dead. And behold, he is going before you to Galilee. There you will see him.’ Behold, I have said {it} to you.”

\p
\v 8 And having quickly gone away from the tomb with fear and great joy, they ran to report {this} to his disciples.
\v 9 And behold,\f + \ft Some manuscripts include the words \fq as they were going to report to his disciples\fq* here.\f*
Jesus met them, saying, “Rejoice!” But they, having approached, seized his feet and worshiped him.
\v 10 Then Jesus says to them, “Do not be afraid. Go, report {this} to my brothers so that they might go away to Galilee, and there they will see me.”

\p
\v 11 Now they going, behold, some of the guard, having come into the city, reported to the chief priests all the things having happened.
\v 12 And having been gathered together with the elders, and having taken counsel, they gave many pieces of silver to the soldiers,
\v 13 saying, “Say, ‘His disciples, having come at night, stole him, we sleeping.’

\v 14 And if this is heard by the governor, we will persuade and make you free from concern.”
\v 15 And they, having taken the pieces of silver, did as they were taught. And this word has been reported among the Jews until today.

\p
\v 16 Now the 11 disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus had directed them.
\v 17 And having seen him, they worshiped, but they doubted.

\v 18 And having approached, Jesus spoke to them, saying, “All authority was given to me in heaven and on the earth.
\v 19 Having gone, therefore, disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit;

\v 20 teaching them to keep everything, as much as I commanded you. And behold, I am with you all the days, until the end of the age.”\f + \ft Some manuscripts include the word \fq Amen\fq* here.\f*
