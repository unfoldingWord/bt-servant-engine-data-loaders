\v 3 And assemble the whole congregation at the entrance of the tent of meeting.”

\ts\*
\v 4 And Moses did just as Yahweh commanded him. And the congregation assembled at the entrance of the tent of meeting.

\p
\v 5 And Moses said to the congregation, “This {is} the thing that Yahweh commanded to do.”

\ts\*
\v 6 Moses presented Aaron and his sons, and he washed them with water.
\v 7 And he put the tunic on him, and he wrapped him with the sash, and he clothed him {with} the robe, and he put the ephod on him. And he wrapped him with the finely woven waistband of the ephod, and he fastened {the ephod} on him with it.

\ts\*
\v 8 And he put the breastplate on him, and he put the Urim and the Thummim on the breastplate.
\v 9 And he placed the turban on his head, and he placed on the turban—to the front of its face—the flower of gold, the crown of holiness, just as Yahweh commanded Moses.

\ts\*
\p
\v 10 And Moses took the oil of anointing, and he anointed the Dwelling and all that {was} in it. And he consecrated them.
\v 11 And he sprinkled some of it on the altar seven times, and he anointed the altar and all its utensils and the basin and its base to consecrate them.

\ts\*
\v 12 And he poured some of the oil of anointing on the head of Aaron, and he anointed him to consecrate him.
\v 13 And Moses presented the sons of Aaron, and he clothed them {with} tunics, and he wrapped them {with} sashes, and he bound headbands on them, just as Yahweh commanded Moses.

\ts\*
\p
\v 14 And he brought the bull of the sin offering near. And Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull of the sin offering.
\v 15 And he slaughtered {it}, and Moses took the blood, and he put {it} on the horns of the altar all around with his finger. And he purified the altar, and he poured out the blood at the base of the altar. And he made it holy to make atonement on it.

\ts\*
\v 16 And he took all the fat that {was} on the innards and the lobe of the liver and the two kidneys and their fat, and Moses caused {them} to become smoke on the altar.
\v 17 But the bull and its skin and its meat and its dung he burned with fire on the outside of the camp, just as Yahweh commanded Moses.

\ts\*
\p
\v 18 And he presented the ram of the burnt offering. And Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.
\v 19 And he slaughtered {it}, and Moses splashed the blood on the altar all around.

\ts\*
\v 20 And he cut the ram into its pieces, and Moses caused the head and the pieces and the suet to become smoke.
\v 21 But the innards and the legs he washed with water. And Moses caused the whole ram to become smoke on the altar. It {was} a burnt offering for a scent of pleasing. It {was} a gift to Yahweh, just as Yahweh commanded Moses.

\ts\*
\p
\v 22 And he presented the second ram, the ram of the ordination offering. And Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram.
\v 23 And he slaughtered {it}, and Moses took some of its blood, and he put {it} on the earlobe of the right ear of Aaron and on the thumb of his right hand and on the big toe of his right foot.
\v 24 And he presented the sons of Aaron, and Moses put some of the blood on the earlobe of their right ear and on the thumb of their right hand and on the big toe of their right foot. And Moses splashed the blood on the altar all around.

\ts\*
\v 25 And he took the fat and the fatty tail and all the fat that {was} on the innards and the lobe of the liver and the two kidneys and their fat and the right thigh.
\v 26 And from the basket of the unleavened bread that {was} to the face of Yahweh, he took one loaf of unleavened bread and one loaf of bread of oil and one wafer, and he placed them on the fat and on the right thigh.
\v 27 And he put the whole on the palms of Aaron and on the palms of his sons, and he raised them {as} a raised offering to the face of Yahweh.

\ts\*
\v 28 And Moses took them from on their hands, and he caused {them} to become smoke on the altar, on the burnt offering. They {were} an ordination offering for a scent of pleasing. It {was} a gift to Yahweh.
\v 29 And Moses took the breast, and he raised it {as} a raised offering to the face of Yahweh from the ram of the ordination offering. It {was} for Moses for a portion, just as Yahweh commanded Moses.

\ts\*
\p
\v 30 And Moses took some of the oil of anointing and some of the blood that {was} on the altar, and he sprinkled {them} on Aaron, on his clothes, and on his sons, and on the clothes of his sons with him. And he consecrated Aaron, his clothes, and his sons, and the clothes of his sons with him.

\ts\*
\p
\v 31 And Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, “Boil the meat at the entrance of the tent of meeting, and there you shall eat it and the bread that {is} in the basket of the ordination offering, just as I commanded, saying, ‘Aaron and his sons shall eat it.’
\v 32 But the remainder among the meat and among the bread you shall burn in the fire.
\v 33 And you shall not go out from the entrance of the tent of meeting {for} seven days, until the day of the filling of the days of your ordination, because {for} seven days, he will fill your hand.

\ts\*
\v 34 Just as he did on this day, Yahweh commanded to do, to make atonement for you.
\v 35 And at the entrance of the tent of meeting, you shall stay day and night {for} seven days, and you shall keep the watch of Yahweh, and you will not die, because thus I have been commanded.”

\p
\v 36 And Aaron and his sons did all the things that Yahweh commanded by the hand of Moses.

\c 9
\p
\v 1 And it happened on the eighth day, Moses called to Aaron and to his sons and to the elders of Israel.
\v 2 And he said to Aaron, “Take for yourself a calf, a son of the cattle, for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, perfect, and present {them} to the face of Yahweh.

\ts\*
\v 3 And to the sons of Israel, you will speak, saying, ‘Take a buck of the goats for a sin offering and a calf and a lamb, perfect sons of a year, for a burnt offering,
\v 4 and an ox and a ram for peace offerings to sacrifice to the face of Yahweh, and a grain offering mixed with oil, for today Yahweh will appear to you.’”

\p
\v 5 And they brought that which Moses commanded to the face of the tent of meeting. And the whole congregation presented {them}, and they stood to the face of Yahweh.

\ts\*
\v 6 And Moses said, “This {is} the thing that Yahweh commanded you will do, and the glory of Yahweh will appear to you.”

\p
\v 7 And Moses said to Aaron, “Draw near to the altar and make your sin offering and your burnt offering and make atonement for the benefit of yourself and for the benefit of the people. And make the offering of the people and make atonement for their benefit, just as Yahweh commanded.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 8 And Aaron drew near to the altar, and he slaughtered the calf of the sin offering, which {was} for himself.
\v 9 And the sons of Aaron presented the blood to him, and he dipped his finger in the blood, and he put {it} on the horns of the altar. And the blood he poured out at the base of the altar.
\ts\*
\v 10 And the fat and the kidneys and the lobe from the liver from the sin offering he caused to become smoke on the altar, just as Yahweh commanded Moses.
\v 11 But the meat and the skin he burned with fire on the outside of the camp.

\ts\*
\p
\v 12 And he slaughtered the burnt offering. And the sons of Aaron brought the blood to him, and he splashed it on the altar all around.
\v 13 And the burnt offering they brought to him in its pieces and the head, and he caused {them} to become smoke on the altar.
\v 14 And he washed the innards and the legs and he caused {them} to become smoke on the burnt offering, on the altar.

\ts\*
\p
\v 15 And he presented the offering of the people. And he took the goat of the sin offering that {was} for the people and he slaughtered it and he offered it as a sin offering, like the first.

\p
\v 16 And he presented the burnt offering and he did it according to the regulation.
\v 17 And he presented the grain offering, and he filled his palm from it, and he caused {it} to become smoke on the altar in addition to the burnt offering of the morning.

\ts\*
\p
\v 18 And he slaughtered the ox and the ram of the sacrifice of the peace offerings that {were} for the people. And the sons of Aaron brought the blood to him, and he splashed it on the altar all around.
\v 19 And the fat from the bull and from the ram, the fatty tail and that which covers {the innards} and the kidneys and the lobe of the liver—

\ts\*
\v 20 they put the fat on the breasts, and he caused the fat portions to become smoke on the altar.
\v 21 And the breasts and the right thigh, Aaron raised {as} a raised offering to the face of Yahweh, just as Moses had commanded.

\ts\*
\p
\v 22 And Aaron lifted his hands toward the people, and he blessed them. And he came down from making the sin offering and the burnt offering and the peace offerings.
\v 23 And Moses and Aaron came into the tent of meeting, and they went out, and they blessed the people. And the glory of Yahweh appeared to all the people.
\v 24 And fire went forth before the face of Yahweh, and it consumed the burnt offering and the fat on the altar. And all the people saw, and they shouted, and they fell on their faces.


\ts\*

\c 10
\p
\v 1 And the sons of Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, each took his censer, and they gave fire in them, and they put incense on it. And they offered to the face of Yahweh strange fire that he did not command them.
\v 2 And fire went forth from before the face of Yahweh, and it consumed them. And they died to the face of Yahweh.

\ts\*
\v 3 And Moses said to Aaron, ”This is what Yahweh spoke, saying,
\q ‘Among those who draw near to me, I will show myself to be holy. And on the faces of all the people, I will be honored.’”
\p
\m And Aaron was silent. \v 4 And Moses called to Mishael and to Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron. And he said to them, “Present {yourselves and} lift your brothers from the face of the Holy Place to {a place} on the outside of the camp.”

\ts\*
\v 5 And they presented {themselves}, and they lifted them by their tunics to {a place} on the outside of the camp, just as Moses had spoken.

\p
\v 6 And Moses said to Aaron and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons, “Do not let your heads be loose and do not tear your clothes, so that you will not die and against all the congregation he will {not} be angry. But your brothers, all of the house of Israel, shall weep {for} the burning that Yahweh has burned.
\v 7 And from the entrance of the tent of meeting, you shall not go out, lest you die, for the oil of the anointing of Yahweh {is} on you.” And they did according to the word of Moses.

\ts\*
\p
\v 8 And Yahweh spoke to Aaron, saying,
\v 9 “Wine or beer do not drink, you or your sons with you, when you go into the tent of meeting, so you will not die—a statute of eternity throughout your generations—
\v 10 and to separate between the holy and between the common and between the unclean and between the clean,
\v 11 and to teach the sons of Israel all the statutes that Yahweh has spoken to them by the hand of Moses.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 12 And Moses spoke to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his remaining sons, “Take the grain offering, the remainder from the gifts of Yahweh, and eat it unleavened beside the altar, for it is a holy thing of the holy things.
\v 13 And you shall eat it in a holy place because it {is} your portion and the portion of your sons from the gifts of Yahweh, because thus I have been commanded.

\ts\*
\v 14 And the breast of the raised offering and the thigh of the contribution you shall eat in a clean place, you and your sons and your daughters with you, for they are given {as} your portion and the portion of your sons from the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the sons of Israel.
\v 15 The thigh of the contribution and the breast of the raised offering, in addition to the gifts of the fat portions, they shall bring to raise {as} a raised offering to the face of Yahweh. And it shall be for you and for your sons with you as an enduring portion, just as Yahweh commanded.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 16 And the goat of the sin offering Moses, searching, searched for. But look! It had been burned up! And he was angry with Eleazar and with Ithamar, the remaining sons of Aaron, saying,
\v 17 “Why have you not eaten the sin offering in the Holy Place, for it is a holy thing of holy things? And he gave it to you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them to the face of Yahweh.
\v 18 Behold, its blood was not brought into the inner Holy Place. Eating, you shall eat it in the Holy Place, just as I commanded!”

\ts\*
\p
\v 19 And Aaron spoke to Moses, “Behold, today they presented their sin offering and their burnt offering to the face of Yahweh, and it has happened to me according to these things. But {if} I ate the sin offering today, would it have been good in the eyes of Yahweh?”
\v 20 And Moses heard, and it was good in his eyes.

\c 11
\p
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying to them,
\v 2 “Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘This {is} the living thing that you shall eat from all the beasts that {are} on the earth.

\ts\*
\v 3 Anything dividing a hoof and splitting the cleft of hooves, making the cud go up among the livestock—you shall eat it.
\v 4 However, this you shall not eat from the ones that are making the cud go up or from the ones that are dividing a hoof: the camel, because it is making the cud go up, but a hoof it is not dividing. It {is} unclean to you.

\ts\*
\v 5 And the rock badger, because it is making the cud go up but it does not divide a hoof, it {is} unclean to you.

\v 9 This you shall eat from everything that is in the water: everything that is to it fins and scales in the water, in the seas, and in the rivers—them you shall eat.

\v 31 These {are} unclean to you among all the swarming things. Anyone who touches them when they are dead will become unclean until the evening.

\v 10 And a son of an Israelite woman (and he {was} a son of an Egyptian man) went out among the sons of Israel. And they fought in the camp, the son of the Israelite woman and the Israelite man.
\v 11 And the son of the Israelite woman blasphemed the Name and cursed. And they brought him to Moses. And the name of his mother {was} Shelomith, daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.
\v 12 And they placed him in custody to declare to them according to the mouth of Yahweh.

\ts\*

\v 13 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

\p
\v 15 And to the sons of Israel you shall speak, saying, ‘A man, a man if he curses his God, then he shall bear his sin.
\v 16 And the blasphemer {of} the name of Yahweh—dying, he shall be executed. Stoning, all the congregation shall stone him. As {for} the sojourner, as {for} the native-born, when he blasphemes the Name, he shall be executed.

\ts\*

\v 17 And a man, when he strikes any life of a man—dying, he shall be executed.
\v 18 And a striker of the life of a livestock shall restore it, a life for a life.

\v 19 And a man, when he gives a blemish to his fellow citizen, just as he did, thus it shall be done to him:

\v 21 And a striker of livestock shall restore it, but a striker of a man shall be executed.

\v 22 One judgment shall be for you. As {for} the sojourner, as {for} the native-born it shall be, for I {am} Yahweh your God.’”

\v 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai, saying,
\v 2 “Speak to the sons of Israel, and you shall say to them, ‘When you come to the land which I {am} giving to you, then the land shall rest {as} a sabbath to Yahweh.
\v 3 Six years you shall sow your field, and six years you shall prune your vineyard, and you shall gather its produce.
\v 4 But in the seventh year there shall be a sabbath of sabbaths for the land, a sabbath to Yahweh. Your field you shall not sow, and your vineyard you shall not prune.
\v 5 The self-grown {produce} of your harvest you shall not reap, and the grapes of your untrimmed {vines} you shall not gather. It shall be a year of sabbath for the land.

\ts\*
\p
\v 6 And the sabbath of the land shall be for food for you: for you, and for your male servant, and for your female servant, and for your hired worker, and for your temporary resident who sojourns with you,
\v 7 and for your cattle, and for the animals that {are} in your land. All its produce shall be to eat.

\ts\*
\p
\v 8 And you shall count for yourself seven sabbaths of years, seven years seven times, and they shall be for you the days of seven sabbaths of years: 49 years.
\v 9 And you shall cause a horn of loud blast to pass through in the seventh month, on the tenth of the month. On the Day of Atonement you shall cause a horn to pass through in all your land.
\v 10 And you shall consecrate the year, the fiftieth year, and you shall proclaim liberty in the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a jubilee for you, and you shall return, each to his possession, and each to his family you shall return.

\ts\*
\p
\v 11 A Jubilee it shall be, the year, the fiftieth year, for you. You shall not sow, and you shall not reap its self-grown {produce}, and you shall not gather from its untrimmed {vines}.
\v 12 For it {is} a jubilee. Holy it shall be to you. From the field you shall eat its produce.
\v 13 In this Year of Jubilee you shall return, each to his possession.

\ts\*
\p
\v 14 And when you sell something to your fellow or buy from the hand of your fellow, each {of} you shall not oppress his brother.
\v 15 According to the number of years after the Jubilee you shall buy from your fellow. According to the number of years of crops he shall sell to you.
\v 16 To the mouth of the multitude of the years you shall increase its price, and to the mouth of the fewness of the years you shall decrease its price, for he is selling to you the number of crops.
\v 17 And you shall not oppress each his fellow citizen, but you shall fear from your God, for I {am} Yahweh your God.

\ts\*
\p
\v 18 And you shall do my statutes, and my judgments you shall keep and do them, and you shall dwell on the land in security.
\v 19 And the land shall give its fruit, and you shall eat to satisfaction, and you shall dwell in security on it.
\v 20 And if you say, ‘What shall we eat in the seventh year? Look, we shall not sow and we shall not gather our produce.’
\v 21 And I will command my blessing to you in the sixth year, and it shall make the produce for three years.
\v 22 And you shall sow {in} the eighth year, and you shall eat from the old produce until the ninth year. Until its produce comes in, you shall eat the old.

\ts\*
\p
\v 23 And the land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for the land {is} mine, for you {are} sojourners and temporary residents with me.
\v 24 And in all the land of your possession, you shall give redemption for the land.

\ts\*
\p
\v 25 If your brother becomes poor and sells some of his possession, then his redeemer, the nearest to him, shall come and redeem the thing sold by his brother.
\v 26 And a man, when there is not to him a redeemer, but his hand reaches and he finds enough {for} his redemption,
\v 27 then he shall calculate the years of its sale and return the excess to the man that he sold to him, and he shall return to his possession.
\v 28 But if his hand does not find enough to return to him, then his sold thing shall be in the hand of the one who bought it until the Year of Jubilee. And it shall go out in the Jubilee, and he shall return to his possession.

\ts\*
\p
\v 29 And a man, when he sells a house of dwelling in a walled city, then its redemption shall be until a year {from} its sale completes. Days shall be its redemption.
\v 30 And if it is not redeemed until a complete year fulfills for it, then the house which {is} in the city which {has} a wall to it {shall be} to the buyer {of} it in perpetuity, to his generations. It shall not go out in the Jubilee.
\v 31 But houses of the villages which there {is} not a surrounding wall to them shall be counted on the field of the land. Redemption shall be to it, and in the Jubilee it shall go out.

\ts\*
\p
\v 32 And the cities of the Levites, the houses of the cities of their possession, a redemption of perpetuity shall be for the Levites.
\v 33 And whatever one from the Levites may redeem, and it shall go out in the Jubilee: the sale of house and city of his possession, for the houses of the cities of the Levites, it {is} their possession in the midst of the sons of Israel.

\v 35 And if your brother becomes poor, and his hand wavers with you, then you shall strengthen him; and {as} a sojourner and temporary resident he shall live with you.
\v 36 You shall not take from him interest or profit, but you shall fear from your God, and your brother shall live with you.
\v 37 Your silver you shall not give to him with interest, and for profit you shall not give your food.
\v 38 I {am} Yahweh your God, who brought you out from the land of Egypt, to give to you the land of Canaan, to be God to you.

\v 39 And if your brother with you becomes poor and sells himself to you, you shall not work him with the work of a slave.
\v 40 Like a hired worker, like a temporary resident he shall be with you; until the Year of Jubilee he shall work with you.
\v 41 Then he shall go out from with you, he and his children with him, and he shall return to his family, and to the possession of his fathers he shall return.
\v 42 For they {are} my servants whom I brought them out from the land of Egypt. They shall not be sold {in} a sale of a slave.
\v 43 You shall not rule over him with harshness, but you shall fear from your God.

\ts\*
\p
\v 44 And your male slave and your female slave who are to you—from the nations who {are} around you, from them you may buy a male slave and a female slave.
\v 45 And also from the sons of the temporary residents, the sojourners with you, from them you may buy, and from their clans who {are} with you, whom they bore in your land, and they shall be to you for a possession.
\v 46 And you may give them as an inheritance to your sons after you, to inherit {as} a possession. You may make them serve to perpetuity, but your brothers, the sons of Israel, a man with his brother, you shall not rule over him with harshness.

\ts\*
\p
\v 47 And if the hand of a sojourner or temporary resident with you reaches, and your brother with him becomes poor and sells himself to the sojourner (a temporary resident) with you, or to a member of the clan of a sojourner,
\v 48 after he is sold, redemption may be to him. One from his brothers may redeem him,
\v 49 or his uncle or the son of his uncle may redeem him, or {someone} from the relatives of his flesh from his clan may redeem him, or if his hand reaches, then he may redeem himself.
\v 50 And he shall calculate with his buyer from the year of his selling himself to him until the Year of Jubilee, and the silver of his sale shall be by the number of years. Like the days of a hired worker he shall be with him.
\v 51 If {there are} still many in the years, to their mouth he shall pay back his redemption from the silver of his purchase.
\v 52 But if few remain in the years until the Year of Jubilee, then he shall calculate with him. According to the mouth of his years he shall pay back his redemption.
\v 53 Like a hired worker year by year he shall be with him. He shall not rule over him with harshness before your eyes.
\v 54 And if he is not redeemed by these {means}, then he shall go out in the Year of Jubilee, he and his sons with him.
\v 55 For the sons of Israel {are} servants to me. They {are} my servants whom I brought them out from the land of Egypt. I {am} Yahweh your God.

\v 3 If you walk in my statutes and keep my commandments and do them,

\v 6 And I will give peace in the land, and you will lie down and there will be no one making {you} afraid. And I will remove harmful animals from the land, and a sword will not pass through in your land.

\v 9 And I will turn to you and make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will establish my covenant with you.

\v 11 And I will put my dwelling place in your midst, and my soul will not reject you.
\v 12 And I will walk in your midst and be God to you, and you will be a people to me.
\v 13 I {am} Yahweh your God who brought you out from the land of Egypt from being slaves to them, and I broke the bars of your yoke and made you walk upright.
\ts\*
\p
\v 14 But if you will not listen to me and will not do all these commandments,
\v 15 and if you reject my statutes, and if your soul detests my judgments so as not to do all my commandments, {so} you break my covenant,
\v 16 {then} I also, I will do this to you: And I will appoint over you terror, the consumption and the fever, making eyes fail and causing life to pine away. And you shall sow your seed {in} vain, and your enemies shall eat it.
\v 17 And I will set my face against you, and you shall be struck down to the face of your enemies. And those who hate you shall rule over you, and you shall flee when no one pursues you.

\ts\*
\p
\v 18 And if up to these {things} you will not listen to me, then I will continue to discipline you seven {times} for your sins.
\v 19 Then I will break the pride of your strength, and I will make your heavens like iron and your land like bronze.
\v 20 And your strength shall be exhausted {in} vain, and your land shall not give its produce, and the tree of the land shall not give its fruit.

\ts\*
\p
\v 21 And if you walk with me {in} hostility and are not willing to listen to me, then I will add on you a plague seven {times} according to your sins.
\v 22 And I will send the animal of the field against you, and it will bereave you, and it will cut off your cattle, and it will make you few, and your roads will be desolate.

\ts\*
\p
\v 23 And if by these {things} you will not accept my discipline but walk with me {in} hostility,
\v 24 then I myself will also walk with you in hostility, and I myself will also strike you seven {times} for your sins.\v 25 And I will bring upon you a sword avenging the vengeance of the covenant, and you will be gathered into your cities. And I will send pestilence into your midst, and you will be given into the hand of an enemy.
\v 26 When I break to you the staff of bread, then ten women will bake your bread in one oven, and they will return your bread by weight, and you will eat but not be satisfied.

\ts\*
\p
\v 27 And if in spite of this you will not listen to me but walk with me in hostility,
\v 28 then I will walk with you in the heat of hostility, and I myself will also discipline you seven {times} for your sins.
\v 29 And you will eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters you will eat.
\v 30 And I will destroy your high places, and I will cut down your incense altars, and I will pile your corpses on the corpses of your idols, and my soul will detest you.
\ts\*
\p
\v 31 And I will make your cities a waste, and I will make desolate your holy places, and I will not smell your pleasing aromas.
\v 32 And I, I will make the land desolate, and your enemies, the dwellers in it, will be appalled at it.
\v 33 And you I will scatter among the nations, and I will draw out a sword after you, and your land will be a desolation, and your cities will be a waste.

\p
\v 34 Then the land will enjoy its sabbaths all the days of its desolation, and you {will be} in the land of your enemies. Then the land will rest and enjoy its sabbaths.
\v 35 All the days of its desolation it will rest, what it did not rest in your sabbaths, when you dwelt on it.

\v 36 And the remaining in you, and I will bring faintness into their heart in the land of their enemies. And the sound of a driven leaf will chase them, and they will flee {as} fleeing from a sword, and they will fall when there is no pursuer.
\v 37 And they will stumble, one on his brother, as from the face of a sword but there is no pursuer, and to you there will be no power to stand to the face of your enemies.
\v 38 And you will perish in the nations, and the land of your enemies will consume you.

\v 39 And the remaining in you will rot away in their iniquity in the lands of your enemies, and also in the iniquities of their fathers they will rot away with them.

\v 40 And they confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their fathers in their unfaithfulness which they were unfaithful to me, and also that they walked with me in hostility,
\v 41 (I also, I walked with them in hostility and brought them into the land of their enemies)—if then their uncircumcised heart is humbled, and they accept their iniquity,
\v 42 then I will remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham I will remember, and the land I will remember.

\p
\v 43 And the land will be deserted by them and will enjoy its sabbaths in its desolation from them. And they, they will accept their iniquity because, even because they rejected my judgments and their soul detested my statutes.
\v 44 And yet for all that, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, nor will I detest them to destroy them completely, to break my covenant with them, for I {am} Yahweh their God.

\ts\*
\p
\v 46 These {are} the statutes and the judgments and the laws which Yahweh gave between him and between the sons of Israel on Mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.

\c 27
\p
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 2 “Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘A man when he makes extraordinary a vow, by your valuation of persons to Yahweh,
\v 3 and your valuation of the male from a son of 20 years and until a son of 60 years will be {thus}, and your valuation will be 50 shekels of silver by the shekel of the holy place.
\v 4 And if {it is} a female, then your valuation will be 30 shekels.
\v 5 And if {it is} from a son of five years and until a son of 20 years, then your valuation will be {for} the male 20 shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
\v 6 And if from a son of a month and until a son of five years, then your valuation will be {for} the male five shekels of silver, and for the female your valuation {will be} three shekels of silver.
\v 7 And if from a son of 60 years and upward, if a male, then your valuation will be 15 shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
\v 8 And if he is too poor from your valuation, then he shall stand him before the face of the priest, and the priest shall value him. Upon the mouth of what the hand of the one vowing can reach, the priest shall value him.

\ts\*
\p
\v 9 And if {it is} an animal which they will present from it an offering to Yahweh, all which he will give from it to Yahweh will be holy.
\v 10 He shall not exchange it and he shall not substitute it, good with bad or bad with good. And if substituting, he substitutes animal with animal, then it shall be {that} it and its substitute shall be holy.
\v 11 And if {it is} any unclean animal which they shall not present from it a present to Yahweh, then he shall stand the animal to the face of the priest,
\v 12 and the priest shall value it between good and between bad. According to your valuation, O priest, so it shall be.
\v 13 And if redeeming he will redeem it, then he shall add its fifth upon your valuation.

\ts\*
\p
\v 14 And a man when he consecrates his house holy to Yahweh, then the priest will value it between good and between bad. Just as the priest will value it, so it will stand.
\v 15 And if the one consecrating would redeem his house, then he shall add a fifth of the silver of your valuation upon it, and it will be to him.

\ts\*
\p
\v 16 And if from the field of his possession a man consecrates to Yahweh, then your valuation will be to the mouth of its seed, seed of a homer of barley at 50 shekels of silver.
\v 17 If from the year of the jubilee he consecrates his field, according to your valuation it will stand.
\v 18 But if after the jubilee he consecrates his field, then the priest shall calculate for him the silver upon the mouth of the years remaining until the year of the jubilee, and it shall be subtracted from your valuation.
\v 19 And if redeeming he will redeem the field, the one consecrating it, then he shall add a fifth of the silver of your valuation upon it, and it will stand to him.
\v 20 And if he does not redeem the field, and if he sells the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed again.
\v 21 And the field shall be, in its going out in the Jubilee, holy to Yahweh, as a field of devotion. It shall be to the priest, his possession.

\ts\*
\p
\v 22 And if he consecrates to Yahweh a field of his purchase which {is} not from the field of his possession,
\v 23 then the priest shall calculate for him the amount of your valuation until the year of the jubilee, and he shall give your valuation in that day. {It shall be} holy to Yahweh.
\v 24 In the year of the jubilee the field will return to him from whom he bought it, to whom to him {is} the possession of the land.
\v 25 And all your valuation shall be by the shekel of the holy place; the shekel shall be 20 gerahs.

\ts\*
\p
\v 26 However, a firstborn (which firstborn {belongs} to Yahweh) among animals, a man shall not consecrate it, whether ox or sheep, it {belongs} to Yahweh.
\v 27 And if {it is} among the unclean animals, then he shall ransom {it} by your valuation and add its fifth upon it. And if it is not redeemed, then it shall be sold at your valuation.

\ts\*
\p
\v 28 However, any devoted thing which a man will devote to Yahweh from all which {belongs} to him, from man and animal and from field of his possession, it shall not be sold and it shall not be redeemed. Every devoted thing, it {is} a holy thing of holy things to Yahweh.
\p
\v 29 All devoted ones who are devoted to destruction from mankind shall not be ransomed; dying he shall be put to death.

\ts\*
\p
\v 30 And all tithe of the land from the seed of the land, from the fruit of the tree, {belongs} to Yahweh. It {is} holy to Yahweh.
\v 31 And if redeeming, a man will redeem from his tithe, its fifth he shall add upon it.
\v 32 And all tithe of cattle and flock, all which passes under the rod, the tenth will be holy to Yahweh.
\v 33 He shall not examine between good to bad, and he shall not substitute it. And if substituting, he substitutes it, then it shall be {that} it and its substitute shall be holy. It shall not be redeemed.’”
\v 34 These {are} the commandments which Yahweh commanded Moses to the sons of Israel on Mount Sinai.
