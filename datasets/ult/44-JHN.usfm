\c 1
\p
\v 1 In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.
\v 2 He was in the beginning with God.
\v 3 All things came into being through him, and without him came into being not one thing that has come into being.
\ts\*
\v 4 In him was life, and the life was the light of men.
\v 5 And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it.
\ts\*

\p
\v 6 There was a man—having been sent from God—his name {was} John.
\v 7 He came as a witness in order that he might testify about the light, so that all might believe through him.
\v 8 That one was not the light, but {came} so that he might testify about the light.
\ts\*
\v 9 The true light, which gives light to all men, was coming into the world.
\ts\*
\v 10 He was in the world, and the world came into being through him, and the world did not know him.
\v 11 He came to his own, and his own did not receive him.
\ts\*
\v 12 But as many as received him, he gave to them the authority to become children of God, to the ones believing in his name,
\v 13 the ones not born from bloods, nor from the will of the flesh, nor from the will of a man, but from God.
\ts\*
\v 14 And the Word became flesh and dwelled among us, and we beheld his glory, glory as of the One and Only from the Father, full of grace and truth.
\v 15 John testifies about him and has cried out, saying, “This was the one of whom I said, ‘The one coming after me has become greater than me, for he was before me.’”
\ts\*
\v 16 For from his fullness we have all received even grace after grace.
\v 17 For the law was given through Moses. Grace and truth came about through Jesus Christ.
\v 18 No one has seen God at any time. The One and Only God, the one being in the bosom of the Father, that one has made {him} known.
\ts\*
\p
\v 19 And this is the testimony of John when the Jews sent priests and Levites from Jerusalem so that they might ask him, “Who are you?”
\v 20 And he confessed—and he did not deny, but confessed—“I am not the Christ.”
\v 21 And they asked him, “What then? Are you Elijah?” And he says, “I am not.” “Are you the Prophet?” And he answered, “No.”

\ts\*
\v 22 Then they said to him, “Who are you, so that we might give an answer to the ones having sent us? What do you say about yourself?”
\v 23 He said,
\q
“I am a voice, crying out in the wilderness:
\q
‘Make the way of the Lord straight,’
\b
\m
just as Isaiah the prophet said.”

\ts\*
\v 24 And the ones that had been sent were from the Pharisees,
\v 25 and they asked him and said to him, “Why do you baptize then if you are not the Christ nor Elijah nor the Prophet?”
\ts\*
\v 26 John answered them, saying, “I baptize in water. In the midst of you stands one you do not know,
\v 27 the one coming after me, of whom I am not worthy that I might untie the strap of his sandal.”
\v 28 These things came about in Bethany beyond the Jordan, where John was baptizing.
\ts\*
\v 29 The next day he sees Jesus coming to him and says, “Behold, the Lamb of God, the one taking away the sin of the world!
\v 30 This is he concerning whom I said, ‘After me comes a man who has become greater than me, for he was before me.’
\v 31 And I did not know him, but so that he might be revealed to Israel, because of this, I came baptizing in water.”
\ts\*
\v 32 And John testified, saying, “I saw the Spirit descending like a dove from heaven, and it remained upon him.
\v 33 And I did not recognize him, but the one having sent me to baptize in water, that one said to me, ‘Upon whomever you might see the Spirit descending and remaining on him, he is the one baptizing in the Holy Spirit.’
\v 34 And I have seen and have testified that this is the Son of God.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 35 The next day, John was standing again with two of his disciples,
\v 36 and having seen Jesus walking by, he says, “Behold, the Lamb of God!”
\ts\*
\v 37 And his two disciples heard {him} speaking, and they followed Jesus.
\v 38 But Jesus, having turned and having seen them following, says to them, “What do you seek?” And they said to him, “Rabbi (which being translated means Teacher), where are you staying?”
\v 39 He says to them, “Come and you will see.” So they came and saw where he is staying, and they stayed with him that day. It was about the tenth hour.
\ts\*
\v 40 One of the two having heard from John and having followed him was Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter.
\v 41 This one first finds his own brother Simon and says to him, “We have found the Messiah” (which is translated “Christ”).
\v 42 He brought him to Jesus. Jesus, having looked at him, said, “You are Simon, the son of John. You will be called Cephas” (which is translated “Peter”).
\ts\*
\p
\v 43 The next day Jesus wanted to go away to Galilee, and he finds Philip and says to him, “Follow me.”
\v 44 Now Philip was from Bethsaida, from the city of Andrew and Peter.
\v 45 Philip finds Nathaniel and says to him, “We have found the one whom Moses wrote about in the law, and the prophets—Jesus son of Joseph, from Nazareth.”
\ts\*
\v 46 And Nathaniel said to him, “Is any good thing able to be from Nazareth?” Philip says to him, “Come and see.”
\v 47 Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to him and says about him, “Behold, a true Israelite, in whom is no deceit!”
\v 48 Nathaniel says to him, “How do you know me?” Jesus answered and said to him, “Before Philip called you, being under the fig tree, I saw you.”
\ts\*
\v 49 Nathaniel replied to him, “Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are King of Israel!”
\v 50 Jesus replied and said to him, “Because I said to you that I saw you underneath the fig tree, do you believe? You will see greater things than these.”
\v 51 And he says to him, “Truly, truly, I say to you, you will see the heaven opened, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of Man.”
\ts\*

\c 2
\p
\v 1 And on the third day there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee, and the mother of Jesus was there.
\v 2 Now Jesus also was invited, and his disciples, to the wedding.
\ts\*
\v 3 And having run out of wine, the mother of Jesus says to him, “They do not have wine.”
\v 4 And Jesus says to her, “Woman, what to me and to you? My hour is not yet come.”
\v 5 His mother says to the servants, “Whatever he might say to you, do.”
\ts\*
\v 6 Now there were six stone water pots standing there for the ceremonial washing of the Jews, each containing two or three metretes.
\v 7 Jesus says to them, “Fill the water pots with water.” And they filled them up to the brim.
\v 8 And he says to them, “Draw now and take {it} to the head waiter.” And they carried {it}.
\ts\*
\v 9 But as the head waiter tasted the water that had become wine (and he did not know where it was from, but the servants—the ones that had drawn the water—knew), the head waiter calls the bridegroom
\v 10 and says to him, “Every man serves the good wine first, and the cheaper wine when they have become drunk. You have kept the good wine until now.”
\ts\*
\v 11 This beginning of the signs Jesus did in Cana of Galilee, and he revealed his glory, and his disciples believed in him.
\ts\*
\v 12 After this he and his mother and brothers and his disciples went down to Capernaum, and they stayed there not many days.
\ts\*
\p
\v 13 And the Passover of the Jews was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
\v 14 And he found in the temple the ones selling oxen and sheep and pigeons, and the money changers sitting there.
\ts\*
\v 15 And having made a whip from cords, he drove {them} all out from the temple, and the sheep and the oxen, and he scattered the coins of the money changers and overthrew their tables.
\v 16 And to the ones selling pigeons, he said, “Take these things away from here. Do not make the house of my Father a house of commerce.”
\ts\*
\v 17 His disciples remembered that it is written, “Zeal for your house will consume me.”
\v 18 Then the Jews responded and said to him, “What sign do you show us, since you are doing these things?”
\v 19 Jesus answered and said to them, “Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.”
\ts\*
\v 20 Then the Jews said, “This temple was built in 46 years, and you will raise it up in three days?”
\v 21 But that one was speaking about the temple of his body.
\v 22 Therefore, when he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he said this, and they believed the Scripture and the word that Jesus had spoken.
\ts\*
\p
\v 23 Now when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover, at the festival, many believed in his name, seeing his signs that he was doing.
\v 24 But Jesus himself did not trust himself to them because he knew all {men}
\v 25 and because he did not have need that anyone would testify about man, for he himself knew what was in man.
\ts\*

\c 3
\p
\v 1 Now there was a man from the Pharisees, Nicodemus {was} his name, a ruler of the Jews.
\v 2 This one came to him at night and said to him, “Rabbi, we know that you have come from God as a teacher, for no one is able to do these signs that you do unless God is with him.”
\ts\*
\v 3 Jesus replied and said to him, “Truly, truly I say to you, unless someone would be born again, he is not able to see the kingdom of God.”
\v 4 Nicodemus says to him, “How is a man able to be born, being an old man? He is not able to enter a second time into the womb of his mother and to be born, is he?”
\ts\*
\v 5 Jesus answered, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless someone would be born from water and Spirit, he is not able to enter into the kingdom of God.
\v 6 {What} has been born from the flesh is flesh, and {what} has been born from the Spirit is spirit.
\ts\*
\v 7 Do not be amazed that I said to you, ‘It is necessary for you to be born again.’
\v 8 The wind blows where it wishes, and you hear its sound, but you do not know where it comes from or where it goes. So is everyone having been born from the Spirit.”
\ts\*
\v 9 Nicodemus replied and said to him, “How are these things able to happen?”
\v 10 Jesus answered and said to him, “Are you the teacher of Israel and yet you do not understand these things?
\v 11 Truly, truly, I say to you that we speak {what} we know, and we testify about {what} we have seen, and you do not receive our testimony.
\ts\*
\v 12 If I told you earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you heavenly things?
\v 13 And no one has ascended into heaven except the one having descended from heaven—the Son of Man.
\ts\*
\v 14 And just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, thus it is necessary for the Son of Man to be lifted up
\v 15 so that everyone believing in him may have eternal life.
\ts\*
\p
\v 16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his One and Only Son, so that everyone believing in him would not perish but would have eternal life.
\v 17 For God did not send the Son into the world so that he might condemn the world, but so that the world might be saved through him.
\v 18 The one believing in him is not condemned, but the one not believing has already been condemned because he has not believed in the name of the One and Only Son of God.
\ts\*
\v 19 Now this is the judgment: that the light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light, for their deeds were evil.
\v 20 For everyone is doing evil hates the light and does not come to the light, so that his deeds might not be exposed.
\v 21 But the one doing the truth comes to the light, so that his deeds might be revealed, that they have been worked in God.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 22 After these things, Jesus and his disciples went into the land of Judea, and he tarried there with them and was baptizing.
\v 23 Now John was also baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because much water was there, and they were coming and were being baptized—
\v 24 for John had not yet been thrown into prison.
\ts\*
\v 25 Then a dispute came about from the disciples of John with a Jew concerning ceremonial washing.
\v 26 And they went to John and said to him, “Rabbi, the one who was with you beyond the Jordan, about whom you had testified, behold, he is baptizing, and they are all going to him.”
\ts\*
\v 27 John replied and said, “A man is not able to receive anything unless it has been given to him from heaven.
\v 28 You yourselves testify to me that I said, ‘I am not the Christ,’ but, ‘I have been sent before that one.’
\ts\*
\v 29 The one having the bride is the bridegroom. But the friend of the bridegroom, the one having stood and hearing him, rejoices with joy because of the voice of the bridegroom. Therefore, this my joy has been made complete.
\v 30 It is necessary for that one to increase, but for me to decrease.
\ts\*
\p
\v 31 The one coming from above is above all things. The one being from the earth is from the earth and speaks from the earth. The one coming from heaven is above all things.
\v 32 He testifies about that which he has seen and heard, but no one receives his testimony.
\v 33 The one having received his testimony has set his seal that God is true.
\ts\*
\v 34 For the one whom God has sent speaks the words of God. For he does not give the Spirit by measure.
\v 35 The Father loves the Son and has given all things into his hand.
\v 36 The one believing in the Son has eternal life, but the one disobeying the Son will not see life, but the wrath of God remains on him.”
\ts\*

\c 4
\p
\v 1 Then when Jesus knew that the Pharisees heard that Jesus is making and baptizing more disciples than John
\v 2 (although Jesus himself was not baptizing, but his disciples),
\v 3 he left Judea and went back again to Galilee.
\ts\*
\v 4 Now it was necessary for him to go through Samaria.
\v 5 Then he comes to a town of Samaria called Sychar, near the piece of land that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
\ts\*
\v 6 Now the well of Jacob was there. Then Jesus, having grown weary from the journey, was sitting right beside the well. It was about the sixth hour.
\v 7 A woman from Samaria comes to draw water. Jesus says to her, “Give me to drink,”
\v 8 for his disciples had gone away into the city so that they might buy food.
\ts\*
\v 9 Then the Samaritan woman says to him, “How do you, being a Jew, ask from me to drink, being a Samaritan woman?” (For Jews do not have dealings with Samaritans.)
\v 10 Jesus answered and said to her, “If you had known the gift of God and who is the one saying to you, ‘Give me to drink,’ you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water.”
\ts\*
\v 11 The woman says to him, “Sir, you do not have a vessel and the well is deep. From where then do you have the living water?
\v 12 You are not greater, are you, than our father Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it himself, and his sons and his cattle?”
\ts\*
\v 13 Jesus answered and said to her, “Everyone drinking from this water will thirst again,
\v 14 but whoever drinks from the water that I will give him will never thirst into eternity. Instead, the water that I will give him will become a fountain of water in him, springing up to eternal life.”
\ts\*
\v 15 The woman says to him, “Sir, give me this water so that I might not thirst and might not come here to draw {water}.”
\v 16 He says to her, “Go, call your husband, and come here.”
\ts\*
\v 17 The woman answered and said to him, “I do not have a husband.” Jesus says to her, “You have rightly said, ‘I do not have a husband,’
\v 18 for you have had five husbands, and the one whom you now have is not your husband. This you have said is true.”
\ts\*
\v 19 The woman says to him, “Sir, I see that you are a prophet.
\v 20 Our fathers worshiped on this mountain, but you say that in Jerusalem is the place where it is necessary to worship.”
\ts\*
\v 21 Jesus says to her, “Believe me, woman, that an hour is coming when you will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.
\v 22 You worship what you do not know. We worship what we know, for salvation is from the Jews.
\ts\*
\v 23 However, an hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth, for indeed the Father seeks such ones worshiping him.
\v 24 God is spirit, and it is necessary for the ones worshiping him to worship in spirit and truth.”
\ts\*
\v 25 The woman says to him, “I know that Messiah is coming (the one called Christ). When he comes, that one will declare everything to us.”
\v 26 Jesus says to her, “I am, the one speaking to you.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 27 And at this, his disciples came, and they were amazed that he was speaking with a woman. Nevertheless, no one said, “What are you seeking?” or “Why are you speaking with her?”
\ts\*
\v 28 Then the woman left her water pot and went back into the town and says to the men,
\v 29 “Come, see a man who told me all things, as much as I have done. This is not the Christ, is it?”
\v 30 They went out from the town and came to him.
\ts\*
\v 31 In the meantime, the disciples were urging him, saying, “Rabbi, eat.”
\v 32 But he said to them, “I have food to eat that you do not know.”
\v 33 So the disciples said to each other, “No one brought him to eat, did he?”
\ts\*
\v 34 Jesus says to them, “My food is that I might do the will of the one having sent me and might complete his work.
\v 35 Do you not say, ‘There are still four months, and the harvest comes’? Behold, I say to you, lift up your eyes and see the fields, for they are already white for harvest!
\v 36 The one harvesting receives wages and gathers fruit for eternal life, so that the one sowing and the one harvesting might rejoice together.
\ts\*
\v 37 For in this the saying is true, ‘One is the one sowing, and another, the one harvesting.’
\v 38 I sent you to harvest that on which you have not labored. Others have labored, and you have entered into their labor.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 39 Now many of the Samaritans from that city believed in him because of the report of the woman, testifying, “He told me all things that I have done.”
\v 40 So when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with them, and he stayed there two days.
\ts\*
\v 41 And many more believed because of his word.
\v 42 And they said to the woman, “We no longer believe because of your speech, for we ourselves have heard, and we know that this one is truly the Savior of the world.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 43 Now after the two days, he departed from there into Galilee;
\v 44 for Jesus himself testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.
\v 45 When therefore he came into Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him, having seen all {the things}, as much as he had done in Jerusalem at the festival, for they had also gone to the festival.
\ts\*
\p
\v 46 Then he came again to Cana in Galilee, where he had made the water wine, and there was a certain royal official whose son in Capernaum was ill.
\v 47 He, having heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, went to him and asked that he would come down and heal his son, for he was about to die.
\ts\*
\v 48 Then Jesus said to him, “Unless you would see signs and wonders, you would certainly not believe.”
\v 49 The royal official says to him, “Sir, come down before my child dies.”
\v 50 Jesus says to him, “Go. Your son lives.” The man believed the word that Jesus spoke to him, and he went away.
\ts\*
\v 51 Now while he was going down, his servants met him and reported {to him}, saying that his son lives.
\v 52 So he asked from them the hour in which he began to improve. Therefore, they replied to him, “Yesterday at the seventh hour the fever left him.”
\ts\*
\v 53 Then the father realized {that it was at that} hour in which Jesus had said to him, “Your son lives.” And he himself and his whole household believed.
\v 54 Now Jesus again did this second sign, having come from Judea to Galilee.
\ts\*

\c 5
\p
\v 1 After these things, there was a festival of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
\v 2 Now in Jerusalem by the Sheep Gate there is a pool, in Hebrew being called Bethesda, having five roofed porches.
\v 3 In these were lying a crowd of the ones being sick, blind, lame, {or} paralyzed.\f + \ft The best ancient copies do not have the phrase \fqa waiting for the moving of the water.\fqa*\f*
\v 4 \f + \ft Some ancient manuscripts include verse 4.\f*  [For an angel of the Lord went down into the pool and stirred up the water at certain times, {and} then the one having first stepped in after the stirring of the water was healed from whatever disease he suffered from.]

\ts\*
\v 5 Now a certain man was there, having 38 years in his illness.
\v 6 Jesus, having seen this one lying there and having known that he already is there a long time, says to him, “Do you want to be healthy?”
\ts\*
\v 7 The sick one replied to him, “Sir, I do not have a man so that, when the water is stirred up, he might put me into the pool. But as I am going into it, another goes down before me.”
\v 8 Jesus says to him, “Get up, take up your bed, and walk.”
\ts\*
\v 9 And immediately the man became healthy, and he took up his bed and began to walk.
\p
Now that day was a Sabbath.

\ts\*
\v 10 So the Jews said to the one healed, “It is the Sabbath and not permitted for you to carry your bed.”
\v 11 But he replied to them, “The one having made me healthy, that one said to me, ‘Pick up your bed and walk.’”
\ts\*
\v 12 They asked him, “Who is the man having said to you, ‘Pick {it} up and walk’?”
\v 13 But the one having been healed did not know who it was, for Jesus had gone away secretly, a crowd being in the place.
\ts\*
\v 14 After these things, Jesus finds him in the temple and said to him, “Behold, you have become healthy! No longer sin, so that something worse might not happen to you.”
\v 15 The man went away and announced to the Jews that Jesus is the one having made him healthy.
\ts\*
\v 16 And because of this, the Jews began to persecute Jesus, because he was doing these things on the Sabbath.
\v 17 But he replied to them, “My Father is working even now, and I am working.”
\v 18 Because of this, therefore, the Jews sought even more to kill him, because he not only was breaking the Sabbath, but also was calling God his own Father, making himself equal to God.
\ts\*
\p
\v 19 Therefore, Jesus answered and said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, the Son is able to do nothing from himself except only what he would see the Father doing, for whatever that one would do, these things also the Son does in the same way.
\v 20 For the Father loves the Son and he shows him everything that he himself does, and he will show him greater works than these so that you might be amazed.
\ts\*
\v 21 For just as the Father raises the dead and makes {them} alive, so also the Son makes alive whom he desires.
\v 22 For not even the Father judges anyone, but he has given all judgment to the Son
\v 23 so that all will honor the Son just as they honor the Father. The one not honoring the Son does not honor the Father having sent him.
\ts\*
\v 24 Truly, truly, I say to you that the one hearing my word and believing the one having sent me has eternal life and does not come into judgment, but he has passed from death to life.
\ts\*
\v 25 Truly, truly, I say to you that an hour is coming, and is now, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and the ones having heard will live.
\ts\*
\v 26 For just as the Father has life in himself, so also he gave to the Son to have life in himself,
\v 27 and he gave him authority to do judgment, because he is the Son of Man.
\ts\*
\v 28 Do not be amazed at this, for an hour is coming in which all the ones in the tombs will hear his voice
\v 29 and will come out—the ones having done good, to a resurrection of life, but the ones having practiced evil, to a resurrection of judgment.
\ts\*
\p
\v 30 I am able to do nothing from myself. Just as I hear, I judge, and my judgment is righteous because I do not seek my own will but the will of the one having sent me.
\v 31 If I testify about myself, my testimony is not true.
\v 32 There is another one testifying about me, and I know that the testimony that he testifies about me is true.
\ts\*
\v 33 You have sent to John, and he has testified to the truth.
\v 34 But I do not receive the testimony from man, but I say these things so that you might be saved.
\v 35 That one was the lamp that was burning and shining, but you desired to exult in his light for an hour.
\ts\*
\v 36 But I have the testimony that is greater than that of John: for the works that the Father has given me so that I would accomplish them—the very works that I do—testify about me that the Father has sent me.
\v 37 And the Father having sent me has himself testified about me. You have neither heard his voice nor have seen his form at any time.
\v 38 And you do not have his word remaining in you, for the one whom he has sent, this one you do not believe.
\ts\*
\v 39 You search the Scriptures because you think that in them you have eternal life, and these are the ones testifying about me,
\v 40 and you are not willing to come to me so that you might have life.
\ts\*
\v 41 I do not receive glory from men,
\v 42 but I know you, that you do not have the love of God in yourselves.
\ts\*
\v 43 I have come in the name of my Father, and you do not receive me. If another comes in his own name, you receive that one.
\v 44 How are you able to believe, receiving glory from one another, and are not seeking the glory that is from the only God?
\ts\*
\v 45 Do not think that I myself will accuse you before the Father. The one accusing you is Moses, in whom you have hoped.
\v 46 For if you believed Moses, you would believe me, because that one wrote about me.
\v 47 But if you do not believe the writings of that one, how will you believe my words?”
\ts\*

\c 6
\p
\v 1 After these things, Jesus went away to the other side of the Sea of Galilee (of Tiberias).
\v 2 Now a great crowd was following him because they were seeing the signs that he was doing on the ones being sick.
\v 3 Now Jesus went up on the mountain, and there he sat down with his disciples.
\ts\*
\v 4 (Now the Passover, the festival of the Jews, was near.)
\v 5 Then Jesus, having lifted up his eyes and having seen that a great crowd is coming to him, says to Philip, “From where might we buy bread so that these might eat?”
\v 6 (But he said this, testing him, for he himself knew what he was going to do.)
\ts\*
\v 7 Philip answered him, “200 denarii {worth} of bread is not sufficient for them, so that each one might receive a little.”
\v 8 One of his disciples, Andrew, the brother of Simon Peter, says to him,
\v 9 “Here is a little boy who has five barley bread loaves and two small fish, but what are these to so many?”
\ts\*
\v 10 Jesus said, “Make the men sit down.” (Now there was a lot of grass in the place.) So the men sat down, about 5, 000 in number.
\v 11 Then Jesus took the loaves, and having given thanks, he gave them to the ones reclining to eat; likewise also with the fish, as much as they wanted.
\v 12 But as they were filled, he says to his disciples, “Gather up the remaining broken pieces, so that nothing might be lost.”
\ts\*
\v 13 So they gathered them up and filled 12 baskets of broken pieces from the five barley loaves which were left over by the ones having eaten.
\v 14 Therefore, the men, having seen the sign he did, said, “This truly is the Prophet coming into the world.”
\v 15 Then Jesus, having realized that they were about to come and to seize him so that they might make {him} king, withdrew again onto the mountain by himself alone.
\ts\*
\p
\v 16 Now as it became evening, his disciples went down to the sea,
\v 17 and having gotten into a boat, they were going over the sea to Capernaum, and darkness had already happened, but Jesus had not yet come to them.
\v 18 A strong wind was blowing, and the sea was being aroused.
\ts\*
\v 19 Then, having rowed about 25 or 30 stadia, they see Jesus walking on the sea and coming near the boat, and they were frightened.
\v 20 But he says to them, “It is I! Do not be afraid.”
\v 21 Then they were willing to receive him into the boat, and immediately the boat came to the land to which they were going.
\ts\*
\p
\v 22 The next day, the crowd that had been standing on the other side of the sea saw that there was no other boat there except one and that Jesus had not entered into the boat with his disciples, but that his disciples had departed alone.
\v 23 Other boats came from Tiberias close to the place where they had eaten the bread loaves after the Lord had given thanks.
\ts\*
\v 24 Therefore, when the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples are there, they themselves got into the boats and went to Capernaum seeking Jesus.
\v 25 And having found him on the other side of the sea, they said to him, “Rabbi, when did you come here?”
\ts\*
\v 26 Jesus replied to them and said, “Truly, truly, I say to you, you seek me not because you saw signs, but because you ate from the bread loaves and were filled.
\v 27 Do not work for the food that perishes, but for the food that endures to eternal life which the Son of Man will give you, for God the Father has set his seal on this one.”
\ts\*
\v 28 Then they said to him, “What should we do, so that we might work the works of God?”
\v 29 Jesus replied and said to them, “This is the work of God: that you would believe in the one whom that one has sent.”
\ts\*
\v 30 So they said to him, “What sign then do you do, so that we might see and might believe you? What will you work?
\v 31 Our fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, just as it is written, ‘He gave them bread from heaven to eat.’”
\ts\*
\v 32 Then Jesus replied to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, Moses has not given you the bread from heaven, but my Father gives you the true bread from heaven.
\v 33 For the bread of God is the one coming down from heaven and giving life to the world.”
\v 34 So they said to him, “Sir, give us this bread always.”
\ts\*
\v 35 Jesus said to them, “I am the bread of life. The one coming to me will certainly not hunger, and the one believing in me will certainly not ever thirst.
\v 36 But I told you that you have both seen me and do not believe.
\v 37 Everyone whom the Father gives me will come to me, and the one coming to me I will certainly not throw out.
\ts\*
\v 38 For I have come down from heaven, not in order that I might do my own will, but the will of the one having sent me.
\v 39 But this is the will of the one having sent me, that I would not lose from it anyone whom he has given me, but will raise it up on the last day.
\v 40 For this is the will of my Father, that everyone seeing the Son and believing in him would have eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 41 Then the Jews began to murmur about him because he said, “I am the bread having come down from heaven.”
\v 42 And they said, “Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we know? How then does he now say, ‘I have come down from heaven’?”
\ts\*
\v 43 Jesus replied and said to them, “Do not murmur among yourselves.
\v 44 No one is able to come to me unless the Father having sent me would draw him, and I will raise him up on the last day.
\v 45 It is written in the prophets, ‘And all will be taught by God.’ Everyone having heard and having learned from the Father comes to me.
\ts\*
\v 46 Not that anyone has seen the Father, except the one being from God—he has seen the Father.
\v 47 Truly, truly, I say to you, the one believing has eternal life.
\ts\*
\v 48 I am the bread of life.
\v 49 Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died.
\ts\*
\v 50 This is the bread which comes down from heaven, so that a {person} might eat from it and might not die.
\v 51 I am the living bread that has come down from heaven. If anyone eats from this bread, he will live into eternity. Now my flesh is also the bread that I will give for the life of the world.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 52 Then the Jews began to argue among themselves, saying, “How is this one able to give us his flesh to eat?”
\v 53 Therefore, Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, unless you would eat the flesh of the Son of Man and would drink his blood, you do not have life in yourselves.
\ts\*
\v 54 The one eating my flesh and drinking my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up in the last day.
\v 55 For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink.
\v 56 The one eating my flesh and drinking my blood remains in me, and I in him.
\ts\*
\v 57 Just as the living Father sent me, and I live because of the Father, so the one eating me, he will also live because of me.
\v 58 This is the bread that has come down from heaven, not just as the fathers ate and died. The one eating this bread will live into eternity.”
\v 59 He said these things in a synagogue, teaching in Capernaum.
\ts\*
\p
\v 60 Then many of his disciples, having heard, said, “This word is hard; who is able to listen to it?”
\v 61 But Jesus, knowing in himself that his disciples were murmuring about this, said to them, “Does this offend you?
\ts\*
\v 62 Then if you would see the Son of Man going up to where he was before…?
\v 63 The Spirit is the one making alive; the flesh profits nothing. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit, and they are life.
\ts\*
\v 64 But there are some of you who do not believe.” For Jesus knew from the beginning who are the ones not believing and who is the one that will be betraying him.
\v 65 And he said, “Because of this, I have said to you that no one is able to come to me unless it would have been granted to him by the Father.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 66 From this {time}, many of his disciples stayed behind and no longer were walking with him.
\v 67 Therefore, Jesus said to the Twelve, “You do not want to go away also, do you?”
\v 68 Simon Peter answered him, “Lord, to whom will we go? You have words of eternal life,
\v 69 and we have believed and have come to know that you are the Holy One of God.”\f + \ft The phrase \fq the Holy One of God\fq* is in the best ancient copies. Some later copies add an additional description, and they read: \fqa the Christ, the Holy One of God.\fqa*\f*
\ts\*
\v 70 Jesus replied to them, “Did not I choose you, the Twelve, and one of you is a devil?”
\v 71 (Now he was speaking of Judas, {son} of Simon Iscariot, for he, one of the Twelve, was going to betray him.)
\ts\*

\c 7
\p
\v 1 And after these things, Jesus traveled about in Galilee, for he did not want to walk in Judea, because the Jews were seeking to kill him.
\v 2 (Now the festival of the Jews, the Shelter Festival, was near.)
\ts\*
\v 3 Then his brothers said to him, “Leave this place and go to Judea, so that your disciples also will see your works that you do.
\v 4 For no one does anything in secret and seeks himself to be in openness. If you do these things, show yourself to the world.”
\ts\*
\v 5 For not even his brothers were believing in him.
\v 6 Jesus therefore says to them, “My time is not yet come, but your time is always ready.
\v 7 The world is not able to hate you, but it hates me because I testify about it that the works of it are evil.
\ts\*
\v 8 You go up to the festival; I am not yet going to this festival, because my time has not yet been fulfilled.”
\v 9 Now having said these things to them, he remained in Galilee.
\ts\*
\p
\v 10 But when his brothers had gone up to the festival, then he also went up, not publicly, but as in secret.
\v 11 Therefore, the Jews were looking for him at the festival and saying, “Where is that one?”
\ts\*
\v 12 And there was much murmuring among the crowds about him. Some were saying, “He is good.” But others were saying, “No, but he leads the crowd astray.”
\v 13 However, no one was speaking openly about him, because of the fear of the Jews.
\ts\*
\p
\v 14 Now the festival already being half over, Jesus went up into the temple and began to teach.
\v 15 Therefore, the Jews marveled, saying, “How does this one know letters, not being educated?”
\v 16 Then Jesus answered them and said, “My teaching is not mine, but of the one having sent me.
\ts\*
\v 17 If anyone desires to do his will, he will know about this teaching, whether it is from God, or I speak from myself.
\v 18 The one speaking from himself seeks his own glory, but the one seeking the glory of the one having sent him, this one is true, and there is no unrighteousness in him.
\ts\*
\v 19 Did not Moses give you the law? Yet none of you does the law. Why do you seek to kill me?”
\v 20 The crowd answered, “You have a demon. Who seeks to kill you?”
\ts\*
\v 21 Jesus answered and said to them, “I did one work, and you all marvel.
\v 22 Because of this, Moses has given you circumcision (not that it is from Moses, but from the fathers), and on the Sabbath you circumcise a man.
\ts\*
\v 23 If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses might not be broken, why are you angry with me because I made a man completely healthy on the Sabbath?
\v 24 Do not judge according to appearance, but judge righteous judgment.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 25 Then some from the Jerusalemites said, “Is not this the one they seek to kill?
\v 26 And see, he speaks openly, and they say nothing to him. The rulers do not truly know that this is the Christ, do they?
\v 27 But we know where this one is from. But when the Christ would come, no one knows where he is from.”
\ts\*
\v 28 Then Jesus cried out in the temple, teaching and saying, “You both know me and know where I am from. And I have not come from myself, but the one having sent me is true, whom you do not know.
\v 29 I know him because I am from him, and he sent me.”
\ts\*
\v 30 Therefore, they were seeking to arrest him, but no one laid a hand on him, because his hour had not yet come.
\v 31 But many from among the crowd believed in him, and they were saying, “When the Christ may come, he will not do more signs than what this one has done, will he?”
\v 32 The Pharisees heard the crowd murmuring these things about him, and the chief priests and the Pharisees sent officers so that they might arrest him.
\ts\*
\v 33 Therefore, Jesus said, “I am still with you for a short time, and then I go away to the one having sent me.
\v 34 You will seek me, but you will not find {me}, and where I am, you will not be able to come.”
\ts\*
\v 35 The Jews therefore said among themselves, “Where is this one about to go that we will not find him? He is not about to go to the dispersion of the Greeks and to teach the Greeks, is he?
\v 36 What is this word that he said, ‘You will seek me, but will not find {me}, and where I am, you will not be able to come’?”
\ts\*
\p
\v 37 But on the last, great day of the festival, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, “If anyone thirsts, let him come to me and drink.
\v 38 The one believing in me, just as the scripture says, ‘Rivers of living water will flow from his stomach.’”
\ts\*
\v 39 (Now he said this about the Spirit, whom the ones having believed in him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.)
\ts\*
\v 40 Then some from the crowd, having heard these words, said, “This is truly the Prophet.”
\v 41 Others said, “This is the Christ.” But some said, “Indeed, the Christ does not come from Galilee, does he?
\v 42 Has the Scripture not said that the Christ will come from the seed of David and from Bethlehem, the village where David was?”
\ts\*
\v 43 So a division happened in the crowd because of him.
\v 44 (Now some of them wanted to arrest him, but no one laid hands on him.)
\ts\*
\p
\v 45 Then the officers came back to the chief priests and Pharisees, and those ones said to them, “Why did you not bring him?”
\v 46 The officers answered, “Never has a man spoken like this.”
\ts\*
\v 47 So the Pharisees replied to them, “You have not also been deceived, have you?
\v 48 None from the rulers have believed in him, or from the Pharisees, have they?
\v 49 But this crowd not knowing the law, they are accursed.”
\ts\*
\v 50 Nicodemus (the one having come to him earlier, being one from them) says to them,
\v 51 “Our law does not judge a man unless it first hears from him and knows what he does, does it?”
\v 52 They answered and said to him, “You are not also from Galilee, are you? Search, and see that no prophet rises up from Galilee.”

Now Jesus went to the Mount of Olives.
\v 2 Now early in the morning he came to the temple again, and all the people came to him.
\v 3 Now the scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman caught in adultery, and they placed her in the middle.
\ts\*
\v 4 The priests say to him, testing him in order to have an accusation against him, “Teacher, this woman has been caught in the act of adultery.
\v 5 Now in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such ones, but what do you say now?”
\v 6 But Jesus, having bent down, began to write on the ground with his finger.
\ts\*
\v 7 But when they continued asking him questions, he stood up and said to them, “Let the blameless one among you throw a stone at her first.”
\v 8 And again, having stooped down, he wrote on the ground with his finger.
\ts\*
\v 9 But each of the Jews went out, beginning with the oldest, so that they all went out, and he was left alone, with the woman being in the midst.
\v 10 And Jesus, having stood up, said to the woman, “Where are they? Did no one condemn you?”
\v 11 And she said to him, “No one, Lord.” And he said, “Neither do I condemn you. Go, from now sin no longer.”]
\ts\*
\p
\v 12 Then Jesus again spoke to them, saying, “I am the light of the world; the one following me may certainly not walk in the darkness but will have the light of life.”
\v 13 Then the Pharisees said to him, “You testify about yourself; your testimony is not true.”
\ts\*
\v 14 Jesus answered and said to them, “Even if I testify about myself, my testimony is true. For I know where I came from and where I am going, but you do not know where I came from or where I am going.
\v 15 You judge according to the flesh; I do not judge anyone.
\v 16 But even if I judge, my judgment is true, because I am not alone, but I and the Father having sent me.
\ts\*
\v 17 But even in your law it is written that the testimony of two men is true.
\v 18 I am the one testifying about myself, and the Father having sent me testifies about me.”
\ts\*
\v 19 Therefore, they said to him, “Where is your father?” Jesus answered, “You know neither me nor my Father; if you had known me, you would have known my Father also.”
\v 20 He said these words in the treasury, teaching in the temple, and no one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come.
\ts\*
\p
\v 21 Then again he said to them, “I go away, and you will seek me, and you will die in your sin. Where I go away, you are not able to come.”
\v 22 Then the Jews said, “He will not kill himself, will he? Is that why he says, ‘Where I go, you are not able to come’?”
\ts\*
\v 23 And he said to them, “You are from the things below; I am from the things above. You are from this world; I am not from this world.
\v 24 Therefore, I said to you that you will die in your sins. For unless you believe that I am, you will die in your sins.”
\ts\*
\v 25 Therefore, they said to him, “Who are you?” Jesus said to them, “What have I even been saying to you from the beginning?
\v 26 I have many things to speak and to judge concerning you. But the one having sent me is true; and the things that I heard from him, these things I say to the world.”
\v 27 (They did not understand that he was speaking to them about the Father.)
\ts\*
\v 28 Then Jesus said to them, “When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then will you know that I am, and that I do nothing from myself. But just as the Father taught me, I speak these things.
\v 29 And the one having sent me is with me. He has not left me alone, because I always do what is pleasing to him.”
\v 30 {As} he is speaking these things, many believed in him.
\ts\*
\p
\v 31 Then Jesus said to the Jews having believed in him, “If you remain in my word, you are truly my disciples;
\v 32 and you will know the truth, and the truth will free you.”
\v 33 They replied to him, “We are the seed of Abraham and have never been slaves to anyone; how can you say, ‘You will be free’?”
\ts\*
\v 34 Jesus answered them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, that everyone committing sin is a slave of sin.
\v 35 Now the slave does not remain in the house into eternity; the son remains into eternity.
\v 36 Therefore, if the Son frees you, you will be truly free.
\ts\*
\v 37 I know that you are the seed of Abraham, but you seek to kill me, because my word has no place in you.
\v 38 What I have seen with the Father, I say; and therefore, what you heard from the father, you do.”
\ts\*
\v 39 They answered and said to him, “Our father is Abraham.” Jesus says to them, “If you were children of Abraham, you would do the works of Abraham.
\v 40 But now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham did not do this.
\v 41 You do the works of your father.” Then they said to him, “We have not been born from sexual immorality; we have one Father: God.”
\ts\*
\v 42 Jesus said to them, “If God were your Father, you would have loved me, for I came from God and am here; for neither have I come from myself, but that one sent me.
\v 43 Because of what do you not understand my speech? It is because you are not able to hear my words.
\v 44 You are from your father, the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father. That one was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he would speak a lie, he speaks from his own {nature}, because he is a liar and the father of it.
\ts\*
\v 45 But because I speak the truth, you do not believe me.
\v 46 Which one of you convicts me concerning sin? If I speak the truth, why do you not believe me?
\v 47 He who is from God hears the words of God; because of this you do not hear, because you are not from God.”
\ts\*
\v 48 The Jews answered and said to him, “Do we not rightly say that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?”
\v 49 Jesus answered, “I do not have a demon, but I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.
\ts\*
\v 50 Now I do not seek my glory; there is one seeking and judging.
\v 51 Truly, truly, I say to you, if anyone keeps my word, he will certainly not see death into eternity.”
\ts\*
\v 52 The Jews said to him, “Now we know that you have a demon. Abraham and the prophets died; but you say, ‘If anyone keeps my word, he will certainly not taste death into eternity.’
\v 53 You are not greater than our father Abraham who died, are you? The prophets also died. Who do you make yourself out to be?”
\ts\*
\v 54 Jesus answered, “If I glorify myself, my glory is nothing; my Father is the one glorifying me—about whom you say, ‘He is our God.’
\v 55 And you have not known him, but I know him. And if I would say that I do not know him, I would be like you, a liar. However, I know him and keep his word.
\v 56 Your father Abraham rejoiced that he might see my day, and he saw and was glad.”
\ts\*
\v 57 Therefore the Jews said to him, “You do not yet have 50 years, and you have seen Abraham?”
\v 58 Jesus said to them, “Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham came into existence, I am.”
\v 59 Therefore, they picked up stones in order to throw at him, but Jesus hid himself and went out from the temple.

\v 1 And passing by, he saw a man blind from birth.
\v 2 And his disciples asked him, saying, “Rabbi, who sinned, this one or his parents, so that he might be born blind?”
\ts\*
\v 3 Jesus answered, “Neither did this one sin, nor his parents, but so that the works of God might be revealed in him.
\v 4 It is necessary for us to work the works of the one having sent me while it is day. Night is coming when no one is able to work.
\v 5 While I am in the world, I am the light of the world.”
\ts\*
\v 6 Having said these things, he spat on the ground and made mud from the saliva and smeared on him the mud on his eyes.
\v 7 And he said to him, “Go, wash in the pool of Siloam,” (which is translated “Sent”). So he went away and washed and came back seeing.

\ts\*
\v 8 Then the neighbors and the ones seeing him previously, that he was a beggar, began saying, “Is not this the one sitting and begging?”
\v 9 Some said, “It is he.” Others said, “Not at all, but that one is like him.” He kept saying, “It is me.”
\ts\*
\v 10 Therefore, they said to him, “How were your eyes opened?”
\v 11 That one answered, “The man called Jesus made mud and smeared {it} on my eyes and said to me, ‘Go to Siloam and wash.’ So having gone and having washed, I received my sight.”
\v 12 And they said to him, “Where is that one?” He said, “I do not know.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 13 They bring him, the one formerly blind, to the Pharisees.
\v 14 (Now it was a Sabbath on the day Jesus made the mud and opened his eyes.)
\v 15 Then again the Pharisees also began asking him how he received his sight. But he said to them, “He put mud on my eyes, and I washed, and I see.”
\ts\*
\v 16 Then some of the Pharisees said, “This man is not from God because he does not keep the Sabbath.” Others said, “How is a man, a sinner, able to do such signs?” And there was a division among them.
\v 17 Therefore, they ask the blind man again, “What do you say about him, since he opened your eyes?” And he said, “He is a prophet.”
\v 18 Therefore, the Jews did not believe about him that he was blind and received his sight until they called the parents of him having received sight.
\ts\*
\v 19 And they asked them, saying, “Is this your son, whom you say was born blind? How then does he now see?”
\v 20 So his parents answered and said, “We know that this is our son and that he was born blind.
\v 21 But how he now sees, we do not know, or who opened his eyes, we do not know. Ask him; he has full maturity. He will speak for himself.”
\ts\*
\v 22 His parents said these things because they were afraid of the Jews. For the Jews had already agreed that if anyone would confess him {as} the Christ, he would be put out of the synagogue.
\v 23 Because of this, his parents said, “He has full maturity; ask him.”
\ts\*
\v 24 Therefore, for a second time they called the man who had been blind and said to him, “Give glory to God. We know that this man is a sinner.”
\v 25 Then that one replied, “I do not know whether he is a sinner. One thing I know: that being blind, now I see.”
\ts\*
\v 26 Then they said to him, “What did he do to you? How did he open your eyes?”
\v 27 He answered them, “I have told you already, and you did not listen! Why do you want to listen again? You do not want to become his disciples also, do you?”
\ts\*
\v 28 And they reviled him and said, “You are a disciple of that one, but we are disciples of Moses.
\v 29 We know that God has spoken to Moses, but we do not know where this one is from.”
\ts\*
\v 30 The man answered and said to them, “Now this is a remarkable thing, that you do not know where he is from, and yet he opened my eyes.
\v 31 We know that God does not hear sinners, but if someone is devout and does his will, he hears this one.
\ts\*
\v 32 From eternity it has never been heard that anyone opened the eyes of one having been born blind.
\v 33 If this one were not from God, he would not be able to do anything.”
\v 34 They answered and said to him, “You were completely born in sins, and you are teaching us?” And they put him out.
\ts\*
\p
\v 35 Jesus heard that they had put him out, and having found him, he said, “Do you believe in the Son of Man?”
\v 36 That one replied and said, “And who is he, sir, so that I might believe in him?”
\v 37 Jesus said to him, “You have both seen him, and that one is the one speaking with you.”
\v 38 Now he said, “Lord, I believe” and he worshiped him.
\ts\*
\v 39 And Jesus said, “For judgment I came into this world, so that those not seeing might see and those seeing might become blind.”
\v 40 {Some} of the Pharisees being with him heard these things and asked him, “We are not also blind, are we?”
\v 41 Jesus said to them, “If you were blind, you would have no sin, but now you say, ‘We see.’ Your sin remains.”

\v 2 But the one entering through the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.
\ts\*
\v 3 The gatekeeper opens for this one, and the sheep hear his voice, and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.
\v 4 When he has brought out all his own, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him, for they know his voice.
\ts\*
\v 5 Now they will certainly not follow a stranger, but they will flee from him, for they do not know the voice of strangers.”
\v 6 Jesus spoke this parable to them, but those ones did not understand what it was that he was saying to them.

\v 7 Therefore, Jesus said to them again, “Truly, truly, I say to you, I am the gate of the sheep.

\v 12 And the hired man, not being a shepherd, of whom the sheep are not his own, sees the wolf coming and abandons the sheep and escapes, and the wolf seizes and scatters them,
\v 13 because he is a hired man, and it is not a concern to him about the sheep.

\v 14 I am the good shepherd, and I know the ones of mine, and the ones of mine know me,

\ts\*
\v 17 Because of this the Father loves me, because I lay down my life so that I might take it up again.

\v 20 Now many of them were saying, “He has a demon and is insane. Why do you listen to him?”
\v 21 Others were saying, “These are not the words of a demon-possessed man. A demon is not able to open the eyes of the blind, is he?”

and Jesus was walking in the temple on the porch of Solomon.
\v 24 Then the Jews surrounded him and began saying to him, “How long are you taking away our life? If you are the Christ, tell us openly.”
\ts\*
\v 25 Jesus replied to them, “I told you, but you do not believe. The works that I do in the name of my Father, these testify concerning me.
\v 26 But you do not believe, because you are not from my sheep.
\ts\*
\v 27 My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.
\v 28 And I give them eternal life, and they will certainly not perish into eternity, and no one will snatch any of them from my hand.
\ts\*
\v 29 My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them from the hand of the Father.
\v 30 I and the Father are one.”
\v 31 The Jews took up stones again so that they might stone him.
\ts\*
\v 32 Jesus answered them, “I have shown you many good works from the Father. For which of those works are you stoning me?”
\v 33 The Jews answered him, “We are not stoning you for a good work, but for blasphemy, and because you, a man, are making yourself God.”
\ts\*
\v 34 Jesus answered them, “Is it not written in your law, ‘I said, “You are gods”’?
\v 35 If he called them gods, to whom the word of God came (and the Scripture is not able to be broken),
\v 36 do you say to the one the Father sanctified and sent into the world, ‘You are blaspheming,’ because I said, ‘I am the Son of God’?
\ts\*
\v 37 If I am not doing the works of my Father, do not believe me.
\v 38 But if I am doing them, even if you do not believe me, believe in the works so that you might know and might understand that the Father {is} in me, and I in the Father.”
\v 39 Therefore, they were seeking to seize him again, but he went away out of their hand.
\ts\*
\p
\v 40 And he went away again beyond the Jordan to the place where John first was baptizing, and he stayed there.
\v 41 And many came to him and were saying, “John indeed did no sign, but all that John said about this one was true.”
\v 42 And many believed in him there.

\p
\v 1 Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus from Bethany, from the village of Mary and her sister Martha.
\v 2 Now Mary was the one having anointed the Lord with myrrh and having wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother Lazarus was sick.
\ts\*
\v 3 Therefore, the sisters sent to him, saying, “Sir, behold, he whom you love is sick.”
\v 4 But having heard {it}, Jesus said, “This sickness is not to death but for the glory of God so that the Son of God may be glorified by it.”
\ts\*
\v 5 (Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.)
\v 6 Therefore, when he heard that he was sick, he then indeed stayed two days in the place where he was.
\v 7 Then after this, he says to the disciples, “Let us go to Judea again.”
\ts\*
\v 8 The disciples say to him, “Rabbi, right now the Jews are seeking to stone you, and you are going back there again?”
\v 9 Jesus answered, “Are there not 12 hours in the day? If someone walks in the daytime, he does not stumble, because he sees by the light of this world.
\ts\*
\v 10 But if someone walks at night, he stumbles because the light is not in him.”
\v 11 He said these things, and after this, he says to them, “Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am going so that I may wake him out of sleep.”
\ts\*
\v 12 Therefore, the disciples said to him, “Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover.”
\v 13 (Now Jesus had spoken about his death, but those ones thought that he is speaking about the sleep of slumber.)
\v 14 Therefore, Jesus then said to them plainly, “Lazarus died.
\ts\*
\v 15 And I am glad for your sakes that I was not there, so that you may believe. But let us go to him.”
\v 16 Therefore, Thomas, called Didymus, said to his fellow disciples, “Let us also go, so that we may die with him.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 17 Therefore, having come, Jesus found him having already been in the tomb for four days.
\v 18 Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about 15 stadia away.
\v 19 And many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary so that they might comfort them about their brother.
\v 20 Then Martha, when she heard, “Jesus is coming,” went to meet him, but Mary was sitting in the house.
\ts\*
\v 21 Martha then said to Jesus, “Lord, if you were here, my brother would not have died.
\v 22 But even now, I know that whatever you would ask from God, God will give to you.”
\v 23 Jesus says to her, “Your brother will rise again.”
\ts\*
\v 24 Martha says to him, “I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day.”
\v 25 Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life; the one believing in me, even if he dies, will live;
\v 26 and everyone living and believing in me may certainly not die into eternity. Do you believe this?”
\ts\*
\v 27 She says to him, “Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God, coming into the world.”
\v 28 And having said this, she went away and called her sister Mary privately, having said, “The Teacher is here and is calling you.”
\v 29 Now when she heard this, she got up quickly and went to him.
\ts\*
\v 30 (Now Jesus had not yet come into the village but was still in the place where Martha had met him.)
\v 31 Then the Jews being with her in the house and comforting her, having seen that Mary got up quickly and went out, followed her, having thought that she was going to the tomb so that she might weep there.
\v 32 Then as soon as Mary came {to the place} where Jesus was, having seen him, she fell down at his feet, saying to him, “Lord, if you were here, my brother would not have died.”
\ts\*
\v 33 When therefore Jesus saw her weeping, and the Jews having come with her weeping, he was deeply disturbed in the spirit and he troubled himself.
\v 34 And he said, “Where have you laid him?” They say to him, “Lord, come and see.”
\v 35 Jesus wept.
\ts\*
\v 36 Then the Jews said, “Behold how much he loved him!”
\v 37 But some of them said, “Was this one, having opened the eyes of the blind man, not able to act so that this one also would not die?”
\ts\*
\v 38 Therefore, Jesus again, being deeply disturbed in himself, went to the tomb. Now it was a cave, and a stone lay against it.
\v 39 Jesus says, “Take away the stone.” Martha, the sister of the one that had died, says to him, “Lord, he will already stink, for it is four days.”
\v 40 Jesus says to her, “Did I not say to you that, if you believe, you will see the glory of God?”
\ts\*
\v 41 Therefore, they took away the stone. Then Jesus lifted up his eyes and said, “Father, I thank you that you heard me.
\v 42 Now I have known that you always hear, but because of the crowd that is standing around I spoke, so that they may believe that you sent me.”
\ts\*
\v 43 And having said this, he cried out with a loud voice, “Lazarus, come out!”
\v 44 The dead man came out, his feet and hands having been bound with cloths, and his face having been bound with a cloth. Jesus says to them, “Untie him, and let him go.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 45 Therefore, many of the Jews, having come to Mary and having seen what he did, believed in him.
\v 46 But some of them went away to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.
\ts\*
\p
\v 47 Therefore, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered the Sanhedrin together and said, “What will we do, for this man does many signs?
\v 48 If we leave him alone like this, all will believe in him, and the Romans will come and will take away both our place and nation.”
\ts\*
\v 49 But one certain man among them, Caiaphas, being high priest that year, said to them, “You do not know anything.
\v 50 You do not consider that it is better for you that one man would die for the people, and the whole nation would not perish.”
\ts\*
\v 51 (Now this he said not from himself, but being high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus was going to die for the nation,
\v 52 and not only for the nation, but so that also the children of God having been scattered would be gathered together into one.)
\v 53 Therefore, from that day they plotted so that they might put him to death.
\ts\*
\p
\v 54 Therefore, Jesus no longer walked openly among the Jews, but he departed from there into the country near the wilderness, into a town called Ephraim. There he stayed with the disciples.
\v 55 Now the Passover of the Jews was near, and many went up to Jerusalem from the country before the Passover so that they might purify themselves.
\ts\*
\v 56 So they were looking for Jesus and speaking one with another as they stood in the temple, “What does it seem to you? That he may certainly not come to the festival?”
\v 57 Now the chief priests and the Pharisees had given an order so that if anyone might know where he was, he should report it so that they might seize him.
\ts\*

\c 12
\p
\v 1 Then, six days before the Passover, Jesus came to Bethany, where Lazarus was, whom Jesus had raised from the dead.
\v 2 So they made him a dinner there, and Martha was serving, but Lazarus was one of the ones reclining to eat with him.
\v 3 Then Mary, having taken a litra of perfumed oil of very precious pure nard, anointed the feet of Jesus and wiped his feet with her hair. Now the house was filled with the fragrance of the perfumed oil.
\ts\*
\v 4 But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, the one going to betray him, says,
\v 5 “For what reason was this perfumed oil not sold for 300 denarii and given to the poor?”
\v 6 (Now he said this, not because it was a concern to him about the poor, but because he was a thief, and having the moneybag, he was stealing the things being put in it.)
\ts\*
\v 7 Therefore Jesus said, “Leave her alone so that she might have kept it for the day of my burial.
\v 8 For you always have the poor with you, but you do not always have me.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 9 Then a large crowd of the Jews learned that he is there, and they came, not only for Jesus, but also so that they might see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.
\v 10 But the chief priests plotted so that they might also put Lazarus to death;
\v 11 for because of him many of the Jews went away and believed in Jesus.
\ts\*
\p
\v 12 On the next day the great crowd, the one having come to the festival, having heard that Jesus is coming to Jerusalem,
\v 13 took the branches of the palm trees and went out to meet him and cried out, “Hosanna! Blessed {is} the one coming in the name of the Lord, even the King of Israel.”
\ts\*
\v 14 Now Jesus, having found a young donkey, sat on it, just as it is written,
\q1
\v 15 
“Do not fear, daughter of Zion; behold, your King is coming, sitting on a colt of a donkey.”
\ts\*
\v 16 His disciples did not understand these things at first; but when Jesus was glorified, then they remembered that these things had been written about him and that they had done these things to him.
\ts\*
\v 17 Then testified the crowd being with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him up from the dead.
\v 18 Because of this also the crowd went out to meet him: because they heard that he had done this sign.
\v 19 Therefore, the Pharisees said among themselves, “You see that you are accomplishing nothing! Behold, the world has gone after him!”
\ts\*
\p
\v 20 Now certain Greeks were among the ones going up so that they might worship at the festival.
\v 21 Then these men went to Philip, the one from Bethsaida in Galilee, and asked him, saying, “Sir, we want to see Jesus.”
\v 22 Philip goes and speaks to Andrew; Andrew and Philip go and speak to Jesus.
\ts\*
\v 23 Now Jesus answers them, saying, “The hour has come so that the Son of Man might be glorified.
\v 24 Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a grain of wheat, having fallen into the earth, dies, it remains by itself; but if it would die, it bears much fruit.
\ts\*
\v 25 The one loving his life loses it, but the one hating his life in this world will keep it for eternal life.
\v 26 If anyone would serve me, let him follow me; and where I am, there will my servant also be. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him.
\ts\*
\v 27 Now my soul has been troubled, and what might I say? ‘Father, save me from this hour’? But because of this I came to this hour.
\v 28 Father, glorify your name.” Then a voice came from heaven, “I have both glorified {it}, and I will glorify {it} again.”
\v 29 Then the crowd that had stood by, also having heard it, were saying that thunder had occurred. Others were saying, “An angel has spoken to him.”
\ts\*
\v 30 Jesus answered and said, “This voice did not come for me, but for you.
\v 31 Now is the judgment of this world: Now will the ruler of this world be thrown out.
\ts\*
\v 32 And I, if I am lifted up from the earth, will draw everyone to myself.”
\v 33 Now he was saying this to indicate what kind of death he was about to die.
\ts\*
\v 34 Then the crowd answered him, “We have heard from the law that the Christ remains into eternity. And how do you say that it is necessary for the Son of Man to be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?”
\v 35 Jesus then said to them, “The light will be with you yet a short time. Walk while you have the light, so that darkness might not overtake you. And the one walking in the darkness does not know where he goes.
\v 36 While you have the light, believe in the light so that you may be sons of light.”
\p
Jesus said these things, and having departed, was hidden from them.

\ts\*
\v 37 Although he had done so many signs before them, they were not believing in him
\v 38 so that the word of Isaiah the prophet might be fulfilled, in which he said:
\q
“Lord, who has believed our report,
\q2 and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?”

\ts\*
\b
\m
\v 39 Because of this they were not able to believe, for Isaiah had again said,
\q
\v 40 “He has blinded their eyes, and he has hardened their heart;
\q2 so that they might not see with their eyes and might understand with their heart,
\q2 and might turn,
\q2 and I will heal them.”

\ts\*
\b
\m
\v 41 Isaiah said these things because he saw his glory and spoke about him.
\v 42 But nevertheless, even many of the rulers believed in him; but because of the Pharisees, they were not confessing {it} so that they would not be put out of the synagogue.
\v 43 For they loved the glory of men more than the glory of God.
\ts\*
\p
\v 44 Now Jesus cried out and said, “The one believing in me believes not only in me but also in the one having sent me,
\v 45 and the one seeing me sees the one having sent me.
\ts\*
\v 46 I have come {as} a light to the world, so that everyone believing in me might not remain in the darkness.
\v 47 And if anyone hears my words but does not keep {them}, I do not judge him; for I have not come so that I might judge the world, but so that I might save the world.
\ts\*
\v 48 The one rejecting me and not receiving my words has one judging him. The word which I have spoken, this will judge him on the last day.
\v 49 For I did not speak from myself, but the Father himself, having sent me, has given me a command, what I should say and what I should speak.
\v 50 And I know that his command is eternal life. Therefore, what I say, just as the Father has spoken to me, thus I speak.”
\ts\*

\c 13
\p
\v 1 Now before the Festival of the Passover, Jesus knew that his hour had come so that he might depart from this world to the Father. Having loved his own in the world, he loved them to the end.
\v 2 And supper happening, the devil having already put into the heart of Judas, {son} of Simon Iscariot, so that he might betray him,
\ts\*
\v 3 knowing that the Father had given all things to him, into his hands, and that he had come from God and was going back to God,
\v 4 he gets up from supper and takes off his outer clothing. And having taken a towel, he wrapped {it} around himself.
\v 5 Then he pours water into a basin and began to wash the feet of the disciples and to dry them with the towel that was tied around himself.
\ts\*
\v 6 Then he comes to Simon Peter. He says to him, “Lord, do you wash my feet?”
\v 7 Jesus answered and said to him, “What I do you do not understand now, but you will understand after these things.”
\v 8 Peter says to him, “You may certainly not wash my feet into eternity.” Jesus answered him, “If I do not wash you, you have no share with me.”
\v 9 Simon Peter says to him, “Lord, not only my feet, but also my hands and my head.”
\ts\*
\v 10 Jesus says to him, “The one that has been washed has no need, except to wash his feet, but he is completely clean, and you are clean, but not all.”
\v 11 (For he knew the one betraying him; because of this he said, “Not all are clean.”)
\ts\*
\p
\v 12 So when he had washed their feet and taken his garments and sat down again, he said to them, “Do you understand what I have done for you?
\v 13 You call me ‘The Teacher’ and ‘The Lord,’ and you are speaking correctly, because I am.
\v 14 If I then, the Lord and the Teacher, have washed your feet, you also ought to wash the feet of one another.
\v 15 For I have given you an example so that you also would do just as I did to you.
\ts\*
\v 16 Truly, truly, I say to you, a slave is not greater than his master, nor {is} a messenger greater than the one having sent him.
\v 17 If you know these things, you are blessed if you do them.
\v 18 I am not speaking about all of you; I know whom I have chosen—but so that the scripture might be fulfilled: ‘The one eating bread with me lifted up his heel against me.’
\ts\*
\v 19 From this moment I tell you, before it happens, so that when it happens, you may believe that I am.
\v 20 Truly, truly, I say to you, the one receiving whomever I might send receives me, and the one receiving me receives the one having sent me.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 21 Having said this, Jesus was troubled in spirit, and he testified and said, “Truly, truly, I say to you that one of you will betray me.”
\v 22 The disciples began looking at each other, wondering about whom he was speaking.
\ts\*
\v 23 Now one of his disciples, whom Jesus loved, was reclining to eat against the chest of Jesus.
\v 24 Therefore, Simon Peter motioned to this one to ask, “Who is it about whom he is speaking?”
\v 25 So having thus leaned back against the chest of Jesus, that one says to him, “Lord, who is it?”
\ts\*
\v 26 Jesus answered, “It is that one to whom I, having dipped the piece of bread, will hand it over and give it to him.” Then having dipped the bread, he gave {it} to Judas, {son} of Simon Iscariot.
\v 27 And after the bread, Satan then entered into him. Therefore, Jesus says to him, “What you are doing, do quickly.”
\ts\*
\v 28 (Now none of the ones reclining to eat knew why he said this to him.
\v 29 For some were thinking, since Judas had the moneybag, that Jesus says to him, “Buy the things we need to have for the festival,” or so that he might give something to the poor.)
\v 30 Therefore, having received the bread, he went out immediately. Now it was night.
\ts\*
\p
\v 31 Therefore, when he had gone out, Jesus says, “Now the Son of Man has been glorified, and God has been glorified in him.
\v 32 And God will glorify him in himself, and he will glorify him immediately.
\v 33 Little children, I am with you for still a short time. You will seek me, and just as I said to the Jews, ‘Where I go, you are not able to come.’ Now I also say this to you.
\ts\*
\v 34 I give to you a new commandment, so that you would love one another; just as I have loved you, so also you would love one another.
\v 35 By this everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love one for another.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 36 Simon Peter says to him, “Lord, where are you going?” Jesus answered him, “Where I go, you are not able to follow me now, but you will follow later.”
\v 37 Peter says to him, “Lord, why am I not able to follow you now? I will lay down my life for you.”
\v 38 Jesus answered, “Will you lay down your life for me? Truly, truly, I say to you, the rooster may certainly not crow before which you will deny me three times.”

\p
\v 1 “Do not let your heart be troubled. Believe in God; believe also in me.
\v 2 In the house of my Father are many dwelling places. But if not, I would have told you, for I am going to prepare a place for you.
\v 3 And if I go and prepare a place for you, I will come again and receive you to myself, so that where I am you also may be.
\ts\*
\v 4 And you know the way where I am going.”
\v 5 Thomas says to him, “Lord, we do not know where you are going. How are we able to know the way?”
\v 6 Jesus says to him, “I am the way and the truth and the life; no one comes to the Father except through me.
\v 7 If you have known me, you will know my Father also. And from now on you know him and have seen him.”
\ts\*
\v 8 Philip says to him, “Lord, show us the Father, and that will be enough for us.”
\v 9 Jesus says to him, “So long a time I am with you, and you do not know me, Philip? The one that has seen me has seen the Father. How do you say, ‘Show us the Father’?
\ts\*
\v 10 Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak from myself, but the Father remaining in me is doing his work.
\v 11 Believe me that I {am} in the Father, and the Father {is} in me. But if not, believe because of the works themselves.
\ts\*
\v 12 Truly, truly, I say to you, the one believing in me, the works that I do, he also will do, and he will do greater than these, because I am going to the Father.
\v 13 And whatever you ask in my name, this I will do so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
\v 14 If you ask me anything in my name, I will do it.
\ts\*
\v 15 If you love me, you will keep my commandments,
\v 16 and I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Helper so that he may be with you into eternity—
\v 17 the Spirit of Truth whom the world is not able to receive, because it does not see him nor know him. You know him, for he remains with you and will be in you.
\ts\*
\v 18 I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you.
\v 19 Yet a short time and the world no longer sees me, but you see me. Because I live, you will also live.
\v 20 In that day you will know that I am in my Father, and you {are} in me, and I {am} in you.
\ts\*
\v 21 The one having my commandments and keeping them, this is the one loving me, and the one loving me will be loved by my Father, and I will love him and I will show myself to him.”
\v 22 Judas (not Iscariot) says to him, “Lord, what has happened that you are about to show yourself to us and not to the world?”
\ts\*
\v 23 Jesus answered and said to him, “If anyone loves me, he will keep my word. And my Father will love him, and we will come to him, and we will make a dwelling place with him.
\v 24 The one not loving me does not keep my words. And the word that you hear is not mine, but of the Father having sent me.
\ts\*
\p
\v 25 I have said these things to you, remaining with you.
\v 26 Now the Helper—the Holy Spirit whom the Father will send in my name—he will teach you everything, and he will remind you of everything that I said to you.
\v 27 I leave you peace; I give you my peace. I do not give to you as the world gives. Do not let your heart be troubled, nor let it be afraid.
\ts\*
\v 28 You heard that I said to you, ‘I am going away, and I will come to you.’ If you loved me, you would be glad because I am going to the Father, for the Father is greater than I am.
\v 29 And now I have told you before it happens so that, when it may happen, you will believe.
\ts\*
\v 30 I will no longer speak many things with you, for the ruler of the world is coming. And he has nothing in me,
\v 31 but so that the world might know that I love the Father, and just as the Father commanded me, thus I do. Get up. Let us go from here.”

\v 1 “I am the true vine, and my Father is the farmer.
\v 2 Every branch in me not bearing fruit, he takes it away; and every one that bears fruit, he prunes it so that it might bear more fruit.
\ts\*
\v 3 You are already clean through the word that I have spoken to you.
\v 4 Remain in me, and I in you. Just as a branch is not able to bear fruit from itself unless it remains in the vine, so neither can you, unless you remain in me.
\ts\*
\v 5 I am the vine; you {are} the branches. The one remaining in me and I in him, he bears much fruit, for without me you can do nothing.
\v 6 If anyone does not remain in me, he is thrown outside like a branch and is dried up, and they gather them and throw {them} into the fire, and they are burned up.
\v 7 If you remain in me, and my words remain in you, ask whatever you desire, and it will be done for you.

\v 12 This is my commandment, that you would love one another just as I have loved you.
\v 13 No one has greater love than this—that he would lay down his life for his friends.
\ts\*
\v 14 You are my friends if you do what I command you.
\v 15 No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know what his master is doing. But I have called you friends, for all the things I heard from my Father, I have made known to you.
\ts\*
\v 16 You did not choose me, but I chose you and appointed you so that you would go and would bear fruit, and your fruit would remain, so that whatever you would ask of the Father in my name, he would give it to you.
\v 17 These things I command you so that you would love one another.
\ts\*
\v 18 If the world hates you, know that it has hated me before you.
\v 19 If you were from the world, the world would love its own. But because you are not from the world, but I chose you from the world, on account of this the world hates you.
\ts\*
\v 20 Remember the word that I said to you, ‘A slave is not greater than his master.’ If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you; if they kept my word, they will also keep yours.
\v 21 But they will do all these things to you because of my name, because they do not know the one having sent me.
\v 22 If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have sin, but now they have no excuse for their sin.
\ts\*
\v 23 The one hating me also hates my Father.
\v 24 If I had not done the works that no one else did among them, they would have no sin, but now they have both seen and hated both me and my Father.
\v 25 But this is so that the word that is written in their law might be fulfilled, ‘They hated me without a cause.’

\v 26 When the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father—the Spirit of Truth who goes out from the Father—he will testify about me.
\v 27 But you also testify because you are with me from the beginning.”
\ts\*

\c 16
\p
\v 1 “I have spoken these things to you so that you might not fall away.
\v 2 They will cause you to be put out of the synagogues. But an hour is coming for everyone having killed you to think he offers a service to God.
\ts\*
\v 3 And they will do these things because they have not known the Father, nor me.
\v 4 But I have spoken these things to you so that when their hour comes, you may remember that I told you about them. But I did not tell you these things in the beginning, because I was with you.
\ts\*
\v 5 But now I go to the one having sent me, and none of you asks me, ‘Where are you going?’
\v 6 But because I have said these things to you, sadness has filled your heart.
\v 7 But I tell you the truth, it is better for you that I would go away. For if I do not go away, the Helper will not come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you.
\ts\*
\v 8 And having come, that one will reprove the world about sin and about righteousness and about judgment—
\v 9 about sin, because they do not believe in me;
\v 10 and about righteousness, because I go to the Father, and you will no longer see me;
\v 11 and about judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.
\ts\*
\v 12 I have many more things to say to you, but you are not able to bear {them} now.
\v 13 But when that one, the Spirit of Truth, comes, he will guide you into the whole truth, for he will not speak from himself, but he will say whatever he will hear, and he will announce to you the things coming.
\v 14 That one will glorify me, because he will take from the things of mine, and he will announce {it} to you.
\ts\*
\v 15 Everything, as much as the Father has, is mine. Therefore, I said that he will take from the things of mine and he will announce {it} to you.
\v 16 And in a little {while} you no longer see me, and again a little {while} and you will see me.”
\ts\*
\v 17 Then some of his disciples said to one another, “What is this that he says to us, ‘A little {while} and you do not see me, and again a little {while} and you will see me,’ and, ‘Because I go to the Father’?”
\v 18 Therefore they were saying, “What is this ‘A little {while}’? We do not know what he is saying.”
\ts\*
\v 19 Jesus knew that they wanted to question him, and he said to them, “Are you seeking among yourselves concerning this, that I said, ‘A little {while} and you do not see me, and again a little {while} and you will see me’?
\v 20 Truly, truly, I say to you that you will weep and lament, but the world will be glad. You will be grieved, but your sorrow will become joy.
\v 21 When a woman gives birth, she has pain because her hour has come, but when she has given birth to the child, she no longer remembers her suffering, because of the joy that a man has been born into the world.
\ts\*
\v 22 And so you have sorrow now, but I will see you again, and your heart will be glad, and no one takes away your joy from you.
\v 23 And in that day you will ask me nothing. Truly, truly, I say to you, whatever you ask of the Father in my name, he will give {it} to you.
\v 24 Until now you have asked nothing in my name. Ask, and you will receive so that your joy may be fulfilled.
\ts\*
\p
\v 25 I have said these things to you in figures of speech; an hour is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figures of speech, but instead I will tell you plainly about the Father.
\ts\*
\v 26 In that day you will ask in my name, and I do not say to you that I will ask the Father on behalf of you,
\v 27 for the Father himself loves you, because you have loved me and have believed that I came from God.
\v 28 I came from the Father, and I have come into the world. Again, I am leaving the world, and I am going to the Father.”
\ts\*
\v 29 His disciples say, “See, now you are speaking plainly, and you are not speaking in figures of speech.
\v 30 Now we know that you know all things, and you do not have need that anyone would question you. In this we believe that you have come from God.”
\v 31 Jesus answered them, “Just now do you believe?
\ts\*
\v 32 Behold, an hour is coming—and has come—that you might be scattered, each one to his own, and you might leave me alone. Yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.
\v 33 I have spoken these things to you so that you might have peace in me. In the world you have troubles, but have courage. I have conquered the world.”
\ts\*

\c 17
\p
\v 1 Jesus said these things and, having lifted up his eyes to the heaven, he said, “Father, the hour has come. Glorify your Son so that the Son might glorify you,
\v 2 since you gave him authority {over} all flesh so that everyone whom you have given him, he would give to them eternal life.
\ts\*
\v 3 Now this is eternal life, that they would know you, the only true God, and the one you sent, Jesus Christ.
\v 4 I glorified you on the earth, having completed the work that you have given me so that I might do it.
\v 5 And now, Father, glorify me along with yourself with the glory that I had with you before the world was made.
\ts\*
\v 6 I revealed your name to the men whom you gave me from the world. They were yours, and you gave them to me, and they have kept your word.
\v 7 Now they know that everything that you have given me is from you,
\v 8 for I have given them the words that you gave me, and they received {them} and truly knew that I came from you, and they believed that you sent me.
\ts\*
\v 9 I ask on behalf of them. I do not ask on behalf of the world, but on behalf of whom you have given me, for they are yours.
\v 10 And all my things are yours, and your things {are} mine, and I am glorified in them.
\v 11 And I am no longer in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, keep them in your name that you have given me so that they would be one, just as we are.
\ts\*
\v 12 While I was with them, I kept them in your name that you have given me. And I protected them, and not one of them perished, except for the son of destruction, so that the scripture would be fulfilled.
\v 13 But now I am coming to you, and I am saying these things in the world so that they would have my joy fulfilled in themselves.
\v 14 I have given them your word, and the world has hated them because they are not from the world, just as I am not from the world.
\ts\*
\v 15 I do not ask that you would take them away from the world, but that you would keep them from the evil one.
\v 16 They are not from the world, just as I am not from the world.
\v 17 Sanctify them by the truth; your word is truth.
\ts\*
\v 18 Just as you sent me into the world, I also have sent them into the world.
\v 19 And for their sakes I have sanctified myself, so that they themselves may also be sanctified in truth.
\ts\*
\v 20 But I ask not only on behalf of these, but also on behalf of the ones believing in me through their word,
\v 21 that they would all be one, just as you, Father, {are} in me, and I in you, that they also would be in us so that the world would believe that you have sent me.
\ts\*
\v 22 The glory that you gave to me, I also have given to them so that they would be one, just as we are one:
\v 23 I in them, and you in me so that they may be made complete as one so that the world may know that you sent me and you loved them just as you loved me.
\ts\*
\v 24 Father, the one you have given me, I desire that they also may be with me where I am, in order to see my glory, which you gave me because you loved me before the foundation of the world.
\ts\*
\v 25 Righteous Father, even the world did not know you, but I know you; and these know that you sent me.
\v 26 And I made your name known to them, and I will make {it} known so that the love with which you have loved me may be in them, and I in them.”
\ts\*

\c 18
\p
\v 1 Having spoken these things, Jesus went out with his disciples across the brook of the Kidron, where there was a garden into which he and his disciples entered.
\v 2 Now Judas, the one betraying him, also knew the place, for Jesus often gathered there with his disciples.
\v 3 So Judas, leading the cohort of soldiers and officers from the chief priests and from the Pharisees, comes there with lanterns and torches and weapons.
\ts\*
\v 4 Then Jesus, knowing all the things happening to him, having gone out, asked them, “Whom do you seek?”
\v 5 They answered him, “Jesus the Nazarene.” He says to them, “I am.” (Now Judas, the one betraying him, was also standing with them.)
\ts\*
\v 6 So when he said to them, “I am,” they went backward and fell to the ground.
\v 7 Then again he asked them, “Whom do you seek?” And they said, “Jesus the Nazarene.”
\ts\*
\v 8 Jesus answered, “I told you that I am. So if you are seeking me, allow these to go away.”
\v 9 ({This was} so that would be fulfilled the word that he said: “Of those you have given me, I lost none from among them.”)
\ts\*
\v 10 Then Simon Peter, having a sword, drew it and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his right ear. Now the name of the servant was Malchus.
\v 11 Then Jesus said to Peter, “Put the sword into the sheath. The cup which the Father has given me, should I certainly not drink it?”
\ts\*
\p
\v 12 Then the cohort of soldiers and the commander and the officers of the Jews seized Jesus and tied him up.
\v 13 And they led him first to Annas, for he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, who was high priest that year.
\v 14 (Now Caiaphas was the one having advised the Jews that it would be better for one man to die on behalf of the people.)
\ts\*
\p
\v 15 Now Simon Peter and another disciple followed Jesus. Now that disciple was known to the high priest, and he entered with Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest.
\v 16 But Peter was standing at the door outside, so the other disciple, who was known to the high priest, went out and spoke to the female doorkeeper, and he brought Peter in.
\ts\*
\v 17 Then the female servant, the doorkeeper, says to Peter, “Are you not also from the disciples of this man?” He says, “I am not.”
\v 18 (Now the servants and the officers were standing there, having made a charcoal fire, for it was cold, and they were warming themselves. But Peter was also with them, standing there and warming himself.)
\ts\*
\p
\v 19 Then the high priest asked Jesus about his disciples and about his teaching.
\v 20 Jesus answered him, “I have spoken openly to the world. I was always teaching in a synagogue and in the temple where all the Jews come together, and I said nothing in secret.
\v 21 Why do you ask me? Ask the ones having heard what I said to them. Behold, these {people} know what I said.”
\ts\*
\v 22 Now he having said these things, one of the officers standing there gave Jesus a slap, saying, “Do you answer the high priest in this manner?”
\v 23 Jesus answered him, “If I spoke wrongly, testify about the wrong, but if rightly, why do you strike me?”
\v 24 Then Annas sent him, tied up, to Caiaphas the high priest.
\ts\*
\p
\v 25 Now Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. Then they said to him, “Are you not also from among his disciples?” He denied {it} and said, “I am not.”
\v 26 One from among the servants of the high priest, who was a relative of the one {whose} ear Peter had cut off, says, “Did I not see you in the garden with him?”
\v 27 Peter then denied {it} again, and immediately a rooster crowed.
\ts\*
\p
\v 28 Then they led Jesus from Caiaphas to the governor’s palace. (Now it was early in the morning, and they did not enter into the governor’s palace so that they would not be defiled, but might eat the Passover.)
\v 29 Therefore, Pilate went out to them and says, “What accusation do you bring against this man?”
\v 30 They answered and said to him, “If this one were not an evildoer, we would not have handed him over to you.”
\ts\*
\v 31 Therefore, Pilate said to them, “Take him yourselves, and judge him according to your law.” The Jews said to him, “It is not lawful for us to put anyone to death.”
\v 32 (This was so that the word of Jesus would be fulfilled which he spoke to indicate by what kind of death he was about to die.)
\ts\*
\p
\v 33 Then Pilate entered into the governor’s palace again and summoned Jesus and said to him, “Are you the King of the Jews?”
\v 34 Jesus answered, “Do you speak this from yourself, or did others speak to you about me?”
\v 35 Pilate answered, “I am not a Jew, am I? Your own nation and the chief priests handed you over to me. What did you do?”
\ts\*
\v 36 Jesus answered, “My kingdom is not from this world. If my kingdom were from this world, my servants would fight so that I would not be handed over to the Jews. But now my kingdom is not from here.”
\v 37 Pilate then said to him, “So then, are you a king?” Jesus answered, “You say that I am a king. For this I have been born, and for this I have come into the world, so that I would bear witness to the truth. Everyone being from the truth hears my voice.”
\ts\*
\v 38 Pilate says to him, “What is truth?” And having said this, he went out again to the Jews and says to them, “I find no guilt in him.
\v 39 But it is your custom that I would release one {person} to you at the Passover. Therefore, do you desire that I would release the King of the Jews to you?”
\v 40 Then they cried out again, saying, “Not this one, but Barabbas.” (Now Barabbas was a robber.)
\ts\*

\c 19
\p
\v 1 Therefore, Pilate then took Jesus and whipped {him}.
\v 2 And the soldiers twisted together a crown from thorns. They put {it} on his head and put a purple garment on him.
\v 3 And they were coming to him and were saying, “Hail, King of the Jews!” and they were giving him slaps.
\ts\*
\v 4 Pilate went out again and says to them, “See, I am bringing him out to you so that you might know that I find no guilt in him.”
\v 5 Then Jesus went out, wearing the crown of thorns and the purple garment. And he says to them, “Behold the man!”
\v 6 Therefore, when the chief priests and the officers saw him, they cried out, saying, “Crucify him, crucify him!” Pilate says to them, “Take him yourselves and crucify him, for I find no guilt in him.”
\ts\*
\v 7 The Jews answered him, “We have a law, and according to the law he ought to die, because he made himself to be the Son of God.”
\v 8 Therefore, when Pilate heard this word, he became even more afraid,
\v 9 and he entered into the governor’s palace again and says to Jesus, “Where are you from?” But Jesus gave him no answer.
\ts\*
\v 10 Therefore, Pilate says to him, “Are you not speaking to me? Do you not know that I have authority to release you, and I have authority to crucify you?”
\v 11 Jesus answered him, “You do not have any authority over me, except for what has been given to you from above. Therefore, the one having handed me over to you has a greater sin.”
\ts\*
\v 12 At this, Pilate was seeking to release him, but the Jews cried out, saying, “If you release this one, you are not a friend of Caesar. Everyone making himself a king speaks against Caesar.”
\v 13 Therefore, Pilate, having heard these words, brought Jesus out and sat down in the judgment seat in a place called “The Pavement,” but in Hebrew, “Gabbatha.”
\ts\*
\v 14 (Now it was a day of preparation of the Passover. It was about the sixth hour.) And he says to the Jews, “Behold your king!”
\v 15 But they cried out, “Take {him} away! Take {him} away! Crucify him!” Pilate says to them, “Should I crucify your king?” The chief priests answered, “We have no king except Caesar.”
\v 16 Therefore, he then handed him over to them so that he might be crucified, and they took Jesus {and} led {him} away.
\ts\*
\p
\v 17 And he went out, carrying the cross by himself, to the {place} called “The Place of a Skull,” which in Hebrew is called “Golgotha.”
\v 18 They crucified him there, and with him two others, on this side and on that side, and Jesus in the middle.
\ts\*
\v 19 Now Pilate also wrote a title and put it on the cross. Now on it was written: JESUS THE NAZARENE, THE KING OF THE JEWS.
\v 20 Therefore, many of the Jews read this title, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city. And it was written in Hebrew, in Latin, and in Greek.
\ts\*
\v 21 Therefore, the chief priests of the Jews said to Pilate, “Do not write, ‘The King of the Jews,’ but rather, ‘That one said, “I am King of the Jews.”’”
\v 22 Pilate answered, “What I have written I have written.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 23 Then, when the soldiers crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them into four shares—a share for each soldier—and the tunic. Now the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from the top.
\v 24 Therefore, they said to each other, “We should not tear it, but instead we should cast lots for it, whose it will be.” This happened so that the scripture would be fulfilled which says,
\q “They divided my garments among themselves
\q and cast lots for my clothing.”
\m Therefore, the soldiers did this.

\ts\*
\p
\v 25 Now standing beside the cross of Jesus were his mother and the sister of his mother, Mary the {wife} of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.
\v 26 Then Jesus, having seen his mother and the disciple whom he loved standing nearby, says to his mother, “Woman, behold, your son!”
\v 27 Then he says to the disciple, “Behold, your mother!” And from that hour the disciple took her into his own {home}.
\ts\*
\p
\v 28 After this, Jesus, knowing that all things had already been completed, so that the scripture might be completed, says, “I thirst.”
\v 29 A container full of sour wine was placed there, so having put a sponge full of the sour wine on a hyssop, they lifted it up to his mouth.
\v 30 Therefore, when Jesus took the sour wine, he said, “It is finished.” And having bowed his head, he gave up his spirit.
\ts\*
\p
\v 31 Then the Jews, because it was a day of preparation, so that the bodies would not remain on the cross during the Sabbath (for that Sabbath was an especially important day), asked Pilate that their legs would be broken and they would be taken away.
\v 32 Therefore, the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first man and of the other one having been crucified with him.
\v 33 But having come to Jesus, as they saw that he had already died, they did not break his legs.
\ts\*
\v 34 However, one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water came out.
\v 35 And the one that had seen this has testified, and his testimony is true. And that one knows that he speaks the truth so that you would also believe.
\ts\*
\v 36 For these things happened in order that the scripture would be fulfilled, “Not one of his bones will be broken.”
\v 37 And again, another scripture says, “They will look at him whom they pierced.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 38 Now after these things, Joseph from Arimathea, being a disciple of Jesus (but secretly for fear of the Jews), asked Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus. And Pilate gave him permission. So he came and took away his body.
\v 39 Now Nicodemus also came—the one having come to him at first at night—bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes, about 100 litras in weight.
\ts\*
\v 40 So they took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in linen cloths with the spices, just as was the custom of the Jews to prepare for burial.
\v 41 Now in the place where he was crucified there was a garden, and in the garden, a new tomb in which no one had yet been buried.
\v 42 Therefore, because of the day of preparation of the Jews and because the tomb was close by, they laid Jesus there.
\ts\*

\c 20
\p
\v 1 Now early on the first of the week, being still dark, Mary Magdalene comes to the tomb and sees the stone having been rolled away from the tomb.
\v 2 Therefore, she runs and comes to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved, and she says to them, “They took away the Lord from the tomb, and we do not know where they have laid him.”
\ts\*
\v 3 Then Peter and the other disciple went out, and they went to the tomb.
\v 4 Now the two were running together, and the other disciple quickly ran ahead of Peter and arrived at the tomb first.
\v 5 And having stooped down, he sees the linen cloths lying there, but he did not enter.
\ts\*
\v 6 Simon Peter then also comes following him and entered into the tomb. And he sees the linen cloths lying there
\v 7 and the cloth that had been on his head, not lying with the linen cloths, but having been folded up in one place by itself.
\ts\*
\v 8 So then the other disciple, the one having first arrived at the tomb, also went in, and he saw and believed.
\v 9 For they did not yet understand the scripture that it was necessary for him to rise from the dead.
\v 10 Then the disciples went away again to their {own homes}.
\ts\*
\p
\v 11 But Mary was standing outside at the tomb, weeping. Then as she was weeping, she stooped down and looked into the tomb.
\v 12 And she sees two angels in white sitting, one at the head and one at the feet of where the body of Jesus had lain.
\v 13 And those ones say to her, “Woman, why are you weeping?” She says to them, “Because they took away my Lord, and I do not know where they put him.”
\ts\*
\v 14 Having said this, she turned around and saw Jesus standing there, and she did not know that it was Jesus.
\v 15 Jesus says to her, “Woman, why are you weeping? Whom are you seeking?” She, thinking that he is the gardener, says to him, “Sir, if you carried him away, tell me where you put him, and I will take him away.”
\ts\*
\v 16 Jesus says to her, “Mary.” Having turned, she says to him in Hebrew, “Rabboni” (which means “Teacher”).
\v 17 Jesus says to her, “Do not hold on to me, for I have not yet gone up to the Father; but go to my brothers and say to them, ‘I go up to my Father and your Father, and my God and your God.’”
\v 18 Mary Magdalene comes, telling the disciples, “I have seen the Lord,” and that he said these things to her.
\ts\*
\p
\v 19 Then, being evening on that day, the first of the week, and the doors of where the disciples were having been closed for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood in their midst and says to them, “Peace to you.”
\v 20 And having said this, he showed them his hands and his side. Then the disciples rejoiced, having seen the Lord.
\ts\*
\v 21 Then he said to them again, “Peace to you. Just as the Father has sent me, so I send you.”
\v 22 And having said this, he breathed on {them} and says to them, “Receive the Holy Spirit.
\v 23 Whoever’s sins you forgive, they have been forgiven for them; whoever’s {sins} you retain, they have been retained.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 24 But Thomas, one of the Twelve, the one called Didymus, was not with them when Jesus came.
\v 25 Then the other disciples said to him, “We have seen the Lord.” But he said to them, “Unless I see in his hands the mark of the nails and put my finger into the mark of the nails and put my hand into his side, I will certainly not believe.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 26 And after eight days his disciples were inside again, and Thomas {was} with them. Jesus comes, the doors having been closed, and stood in their midst, and said, “Peace to you.”
\v 27 Then he says to Thomas, “Place your finger here and see my hands. And reach out your hand and put it into my side. And do not be unbelieving, but believing.”
\ts\*
\v 28 Thomas answered and said to him, “My Lord and my God.”
\v 29 Jesus says to him, “Because you have seen me, you have believed; blessed {are} the ones not having seen, and having believed.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 30 Then Jesus also did many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which have not been written in this book,
\v 31 but these things have been written so that you would believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and so that believing, you would have life in his name.
\ts\*

\c 21
\p
\v 1 After these things, Jesus showed himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias. Now in this manner he showed himself:
\v 2 they were together—Simon Peter and Thomas called Didymus and Nathaniel from Cana of Galilee and the {sons} of Zebedee and two others from his disciples.
\v 3 Simon Peter says to them, “I am going fishing.” They say to him, “We also are coming with you.” They went out and got into a boat, but they caught nothing during that night.
\ts\*
\v 4 Now, when it was already early morning, Jesus stood on the beach, but the disciples did not know that it is Jesus.
\v 5 Then Jesus says to them, “Children, you do not have any fish to eat, do you?” They answered him, “No.”
\v 6 But he said to them, “Throw the net to the right side of the boat, and you will find some.” Therefore, they threw {the net} and did not have the strength to draw it in, because of the large number of fish.
\ts\*
\v 7 Then that disciple whom Jesus loved says to Peter, “It is the Lord.” Therefore, Simon Peter, having heard that it was the Lord, put on his outer garment (for he was undressed), and threw himself into the sea.
\v 8 But the other disciples came in the boat (for they were not far from the land, but about 200 cubits away), dragging the net of the fish.
\v 9 Then when they got out upon the land, they see a charcoal fire kindled and a fish laid on it and a bread loaf.
\ts\*
\v 10 Jesus says to them, “Bring some of the fish that you just caught.”
\v 11 Therefore, Simon Peter went up and pulled the net to the shore, full of large fish; 153. But being so many, the net was not torn.
\ts\*
\v 12 Jesus says to them, “Come, eat breakfast.” But none of the disciples dared to ask him, “Who are you?” They knew that it is the Lord.
\v 13 Jesus comes and takes the bread and gives {it} to them, and the fish in the same way.
\v 14 This {was} already the third time that Jesus was revealed to the disciples, having been raised from the dead.
\ts\*
\p
\v 15 Then when they ate breakfast, Jesus says to Simon Peter, “Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?” He says to him, “Yes Lord, you know that I love you.” He says to him, “Feed my lambs.”
\v 16 He says to him again, a second {time}, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?” He says to him, “Yes, Lord, you know that I love you.” He says to him, “Take care of my sheep.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 17 He says to him the third {time}, “Simon, son of John, do you love me?” Peter was grieved because he said to him the third {time}, “Do you love me?” And he says to him, “Lord, you know all things; you know that I love you.” Jesus says to him, “Feed my sheep.
\v 18 Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, you used to gird yourself and walk wherever you wanted, but when you become old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will gird you and carry {you} where you do not want.”
\ts\*
\v 19 Now he said this, indicating with what manner of death he will glorify God. And having said this, he says to him, “Follow me.”
\ts\*
\v 20 Having turned around, Peter sees the disciple whom Jesus loved following them, who indeed leaned back against his chest at the dinner and said, “Lord, who is the one betraying you?”
\v 21 Therefore, having seen him, Peter says to Jesus, “But Lord, what about this one?”
\ts\*
\v 22 Jesus says to him, “If I want him to remain until I come, what {is that} to you? You follow me.”
\v 23 So this word spread among the brothers, that that disciple does not die. But Jesus did not say to him that he does not die, but, “If I want him to remain until I come, what {is that} to you?”
\ts\*
\p
\v 24 This is the disciple testifying about these things and the one having written these things, and we know that his testimony is true.
\v 25 Now there are also many other things that Jesus did, which, if each one were written down, I imagine not even the world itself to have enough room for the books being written.
