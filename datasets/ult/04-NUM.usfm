\v 12 “And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from the midst of the sons of Israel instead of every firstborn, the opener of the womb from the sons of Israel, and the Levites are for me,
\v 13 for every firstborn belongs to me. In the day of my striking down every firstborn in the land of Egypt, I set apart for me every firstborn in Israel, from human up to livestock. They are for me. I am Yahweh.”

\p
\v 14 And Yahweh spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, saying,
\v 15 “Count the sons of Levi according to the house of their fathers, according to their clans. You shall count them, every male from a son of a month and upward.”

\v 37 and the pillars of the courtyard all around and their bases and their pegs and their ropes.
\p
\v 38 And the ones camping before the face of the Dwelling to the east, before the face of the tent of meeting toward the sunrise, {were to be} Moses and Aaron and his sons, the keepers of the keeping of the holy place, according to the keeping of the sons of Israel. And the stranger who comes near shall be put to death.
\v 39 All the counted ones of the Levites whom Moses and Aaron counted in accordance with the mouth of Yahweh, according to their clans, every male from a son of a month and upward, {were} 22, 000.
\p
\v 40 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Count every firstborn male of the sons of Israel from a son of a month and upward. And lift up the number of their names.
\v 41 And you shall take the Levites for me—I {am} Yahweh—instead of all the firstborn of the sons of Israel, and the livestock of the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the livestock of the sons of Israel.”

\v 42 And Moses counted all the firstborn of the sons of Israel, just as Yahweh had commanded him.
\v 43 And it happened that every firstborn male by the number of the names from a son of a month and upward, according to their counted ones, {was} 22, 273.

\p
\v 44 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 45 “Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the sons of Israel, and the livestock of the Levites instead of their livestock. And the Levites shall belong to me—I {am} Yahweh.

\v 46 And the ransoms of the 273, the ones in excess over the Levites from the firstborn of the sons of Israel,
\v 47 and you shall take five, five shekels for the skull. You shall take by the shekel of the holy place (20 gerahs {is} the shekel).
\v 48 And you shall give the silver to Aaron and to his sons, the ransom of the ones in excess among them.”
\v 49 And Moses took the silver of the ransom from with the ones in excess over the ransomed ones of the Levites.
\v 50 From with the firstborn of the sons of Israel he took the silver: 1, 365 by the shekel of the holy place.
\v 51 And Moses gave the silver of the ransom to Aaron and to his sons in accordance with the mouth of Yahweh, just as Yahweh had commanded Moses.

\c 4
\p
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
\v 2 “Lift up the head of the sons of Kohath from the midst of the sons of Levi, according to their clans, according to the house of their fathers,
\v 3 from a son of 30 years and upward and up to a son of 50 years, all who come to the company to do work in the tent of meeting.
\v 4 This {is} the service of the sons of Kohath in the tent of meeting, the holiest holy things.
\v 5 And Aaron and his sons shall come when the camp sets out, and they shall take down the curtain of the covering, and with it they shall cover the box of the testimony.
\v 6 And they shall put on it a covering of the skin of the porpoise, and they shall spread a cloth entirely of blue above, and they shall place its poles.
\v 7 And over the table of the faces they shall spread a cloth of blue, and they shall put on it the plates and the palm-sized bowls and the bowls and the pitchers of the drink offering, and the bread of continuity shall be on it.
\v 8 And they shall spread on them a cloth of the worms of scarlet, and they shall cover it with a covering of the skin of the porpoise, and they shall place its poles.
\v 9 And they shall take a cloth of blue and cover the lampstand of the light source and its lamps and its snuffers and its trays and all the vessels of its oil with which they serve it.
\v 10 And they shall put it and all its vessels into a covering of the skin of the porpoise, and they shall put {it} on the carrying pole.
\v 11 And on the altar of gold they shall spread a cloth of blue, and they shall cover it with a covering of the skin of the porpoise, and they shall place its poles.

\v 15 And Aaron and his sons shall finish to cover the holy place and all the implements of the holy place when the camp sets out. And afterward the sons of Kohath shall come to carry {them}, and they shall not touch the holy thing and die. These are the load of the sons of Kohath in the tent of meeting.
\v 16 And the oversight of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, {is} the oil of the light source and the incense of the spices and the grain offering of the continuity and the oil of the anointment, the oversight of all the Dwelling and all that {is} in it, with the holy place and with its implements.”
\p
\v 17 And Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
\v 18 “Do not let the tribe of the clans of the Kohathite be cut off from the midst of the Levites.
\v 19 But do this for them, and they will live and not die when they approach the holiest holy things: Aaron and his sons shall enter and place them man by man in accordance with his service and according to his load.
\v 20 But they shall not enter to look at the holy thing like a gulp and die.”

\p
\v 21 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 22 “Lift up the head of the sons of Gershon, even them, according to the house of their fathers, according to their clans.
\v 23 You shall count them from a son of 30 years and upward up to a son of 50 years, every one who comes to work work, to serve service in the tent of meeting.
\v 24 This {is} the service of the clans of the Gershonite, for serving and for a load.
\v 25 And they shall carry the curtains of the Dwelling and the tent of meeting, its covering, the covering of porpoise which is on it above, and the covering of the opening of the tent of meeting
\v 26 and the hangings of the courtyard and the covering of the opening of the gate of the courtyard that is beside the Dwelling and beside the altar all around, and their ropes and all the implements of their service and all that is to be done for them; and they shall serve.
\v 27 In accordance with the mouth of Aaron and his sons will be all the service of the sons of the Gershonite, according to all their load and according to all their service. And you shall appoint to them by responsibility all their load.
\v 28 This {is} the service of the clans of the sons of the Gershonite in the tent of meeting and their responsibility in the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.

\p
\v 29 You shall count them, the sons of Merari, according to their clans, according to the house of their fathers.
\v 30 You shall count them from a son of 30 years and upward and up to a son of 50 years, every one who comes to the company, to serve the service of the tent of meeting.
\v 31 And this {is} the responsibility of their load, according to all their service in the tent of meeting: the frames of the Dwelling and its crossbars and its pillars and its bases
\v 32 and the pillars of the courtyard all around and their bases and their pegs and their ropes, for all their implements and for all their service; and by names you shall appoint the implements of the responsibility of their load.

\v 33 This {is} the service of the clans of the sons of Merari for all their service in the tent of meeting in the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.”
\p
\v 34 And Moses and Aaron and the leaders of the congregation counted the sons of the Kohathite according to their clans and according to the house of their fathers,
\v 35 from a son of 30 years and upward and up to a son of 50 years, every one who comes to the company for service in the tent of meeting,

\v 48 and their counted ones were 8, 580.
\v 49 In accordance with the mouth of Yahweh they were counted by the hand of Moses, man by man in accordance with his service and in accordance with his load. So {these were} his counted ones that Yahweh had commanded Moses.

\c 5
\p
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 2 “Command the sons of Israel and they shall send away from the camp every one with an infectious skin disease and every one who flows and every one unclean by a dead person.
\v 3 From male up to female you shall send, to the outside of the camp you shall send them. And they shall not defile their camp, because I am dwelling in the midst of them.”
\v 4 And the sons of Israel did so, and they sent them to the outside of the camp. Thus the sons of Israel did just as Yahweh had spoken to Moses.

\p
\v 5 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 6 “Speak to the sons of Israel: ‘When a man or woman does from any of the sins of the human to act unfaithfully in unfaithfulness against Yahweh, then that person has done wrong.
\v 7 And they shall confess their sin that they did, and he shall return his price of wrongdoing by its head and he shall add its fifth in addition to it, and he shall give to whom he has done wrong to.

\v 8 And if there is not a redeemer for the man to return the price of wrongdoing to him, the price of wrongdoing will be returned to Yahweh, to the priest, apart from the ram of the atonement with which he shall make atonement for him.
\v 9 And every contribution of all the holy things of the sons of Israel that they offer to the priest, it shall belong to him.
\v 10 And a man, his holy things shall belong to him; what a man gives to the priest shall belong to him.’”
\p
\v 11 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 12 “Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘Man by man, if his wife turns aside and acts unfaithfully against him in unfaithfulness,

\v 13 and a man lies the lying of seed with her and it is concealed from the eyes of her husband, and it is hidden, and she herself is defiled, and there is no witness against her, and she herself has not been caught,
\v 14 and a spirit of jealousy passes over on him and he is jealous of his wife and she herself is defiled, or a spirit of jealousy comes over on him and he is jealous of his wife but she herself is not defiled;
\v 15 then the man shall bring his wife to the priest. And he shall bring her offering for her, the tenth of the ephah of the flour of barley. He shall not pour oil on it, and he shall not put frankincense on it, for it is a grain offering of jealousy, a grain offering of remembrance, one that causes iniquity to be remembered.

\p
\v 16 And the priest shall bring her near, and he shall stand her before the face of Yahweh.
\v 17 And the priest shall take the holy water in the vessel of clay, and the priest shall take some of the dust that is on the floor of the Dwelling, and he shall put it into the water.

\v 18 And the priest shall stand the woman before the face of Yahweh, and he shall unbind the head of the woman, and he shall put on her palm the grain offering of remembrance. It is the grain offering of jealousy. And in the hand of the priest shall be the water of bitterness that brings a curse.
\v 19 And the priest shall make her swear, and he shall say to the woman, “If a man has not lain with you, and if you have not turned aside to uncleanness under your husband, you will be free from this water of bitterness that brings a curse.

\v 20 But if you have turned aside under your husband, and if you are defiled and a man apart from your husband has given his lying with you,”
\v 21 (and the priest shall make the woman swear with an oath of the curse). And the priest shall say to the woman, “Yahweh will make you into a curse and into an oath in the midst of your people when Yahweh makes your thigh fall away and your abdomen swell.
\v 22 And this water that brings a curse will enter in your inward parts to cause swelling of the abdomen and to cause falling away of your thigh.” And the woman shall say, “Truly, truly.”

\p
\v 23 And the priest shall write these curses in the book, and he shall wipe it off into the water of bitterness.

\v 24 And he shall cause the woman to drink the water of bitterness that brings a curse, and the water that brings a curse of bitterness will enter in her.
\v 25 And the priest shall take the grain offering of jealousy from the hand of the woman, and he shall wave the grain offering before the face of Yahweh, and he shall bring it near to the altar.
\v 26 And the priest shall grasp from the grain offering its memorial portion and he shall burn it up at the altar. And after he shall make the woman drink the water.
\v 27 And he shall make her drink the water. And it will be that if she is defiled and has acted unfaithfully in unfaithfulness with her husband, then the water that brings a curse of bitterness will enter in her, and her abdomen will swell, and her thigh will fall away, and the woman will become a curse in the midst of her people.
\v 28 And if the woman is not defiled, then she herself is clean, and she will be free, and she will be sown with seed.

\p
\v 29 This is the law of jealousy when a woman turns aside under her husband and is defiled,
\v 30 or a man, when a spirit of jealousy passes over on him and he is jealous of his wife, and he shall stand the woman before the face of Yahweh, and the priest shall do all this law to her.

\v 31 And the man will be free from iniquity, and this woman will carry her iniquity.’”



\c 6
\p
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 2 “Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘When a man or a woman does something extraordinary by vowing the vow of a separate one to separate to Yahweh,
\v 3 he shall separate from wine and intoxicating drink. He shall not drink the vinegar of wine and the vinegar of intoxicating drink, and he shall not drink any of the juice of grapes, and he shall not eat moist and dried grapes.
\v 4 All the days of his separation, he shall not eat from all that is made from the vine of the wine, from seeds and up to skin.
\p
\v 5 All the days of the vow of his separation, a razor shall not pass over his head. Until the fulfilling of the days that he has separated to Yahweh, he shall be holy; the locks of the hair of his head shall grow long.

\p
\v 6 All the days of his separation to Yahweh he shall not go near a person who is dead.
\v 7 For his father and for his mother, for his brother and for his sister, he shall not defile himself for them with their death, because the separation of his God is on his head.
\v 8 All the days of his separation he shall be holy to Yahweh.
\p
\v 9 And if one who is dead dies near him in suddenness suddenly, and he defiles the head of his separation, then he shall shave his head on the day of his cleansing; on the seventh day he shall shave it,
\v 10 and on the eighth day he shall bring two of the turtledoves or two of the sons of the dove to the priest, to the opening of the tent of meeting.
\v 11 And the priest shall make one for a sin offering and one for a burnt offering, and he shall make atonement for him, because he sinned on account of the person. And he shall make his head holy on that day.
\v 12 And he shall separate to Yahweh the days of his separation, and he shall bring a male lamb, a son of his year, for a guilt offering. And the first days shall fall, because his separation was defiled.

\p
\v 13 And this is the law of the separate one: On a day fulfilling the days of his separation, he shall bring him to the opening of the tent of meeting,
\v 14 and he shall offer his offering to Yahweh: one male lamb without defect, a son of his year, for a burnt offering; and one female lamb without defect, a daughter of her year, for a sin offering, and one ram without defect for peace offerings,
\v 15 and a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mixed with the oil, and wafers of unleavened bread smeared with the oil and their grain offering and their drink offerings.

\v 16 And the priest shall offer before the face of Yahweh, and he shall make his sin offering and his burnt offering.
\v 17 And he shall make the ram a sacrifice of peace offerings to Yahweh with the basket of the unleavened bread. And the priest shall make his grain offering and his drink offering.

\v 18 And the separate one shall shave the head of his separation at the opening of the tent of meeting, and he shall take the hair of the head of his separation, and he shall put it on the fire that is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings.
\v 19 And the priest shall take the boiled shoulder from the ram and one cake of unleavened bread from the basket and one wafer of unleavened bread, and he shall put them on the palms of the separate one after his shaving his separation.
\v 20 And the priest shall wave them as a wave offering before the face of Yahweh. It is a holy thing to the priest with the breast of the wave offering and with the thigh of the contribution. And after, the separate one may drink wine.
\p
\v 21 This is the law of the separate one who vows his offering to Yahweh for his separation, apart from what his hand reaches. According to the mouth of his vow that he vowed, so he shall do in accordance with the law of his separation.’”

\p
\v 22 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 23 “Speak to Aaron and to his sons, saying, ‘Thus you shall bless the sons of Israel, saying to them,
\p
\v 24 “May Yahweh bless you and keep you.

\p
\v 25 May Yahweh cause his face to shine to you and may he be gracious to you.
\p
\v 26 May Yahweh lift up his face to you and may he set peace for you.”’
\p
\v 27 And they shall set my name on the sons of Israel and I shall bless them.”



\c 7
\p
\v 1 And it happened on the day Moses finished erecting the Dwelling that he anointed it and made it holy and all its vessels and the altar and all its vessels. And he anointed them and made them holy.
\v 2 And the leaders of Israel, the heads of the house of their fathers, made an offering. They were the leaders of the tribes. They were the ones standing over the counted ones.
\v 3 And they brought their offering before the face of Yahweh, six covered carts and twelve cattle, a cart for two of the leaders and an ox for one. And they offered them before the face of the Dwelling.

\v 4 And Yahweh said to Moses, saying,
\v 5 “Take from with them and they shall be for serving the service of the tent of meeting. And you shall give them to the Levites, a man according to the mouth of his service.”

\v 6 And Moses took the carts and the cattle, and he gave them to the Levites.
\v 7 He gave two of the carts and four of the cattle to the sons of Gershon, according to the mouth of their service.
\v 8 And he gave four of the carts and eight of the cattle to the sons of Merari, according to the mouth of their service, by the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.

\v 9 But he did not give to the sons of Kohath, for the service of the holy place was on them; they carried on the shoulder.

\v 10 And the leaders offered the dedication of the altar on the day it was anointed. And the leaders offered their offering before the face of the altar.
\v 11 And Yahweh said to Moses, “One leader for the day, one leader for the day shall they offer their offering for the dedication of the altar.”

\v 89 And when Moses entered into the tent of meeting to speak with him, then he heard the voice speaking to him from above the atonement lid that is on the box of the testimony, from between the two cherubim. And he spoke to him.



\c 8
\p
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 2 “Speak to Aaron and say to him, ‘When you lift up the lamps to the front of the face of the lampstand, the seven lamps shall give light.’”

\v 3 And Aaron did so. To the front of the face of the lampstand he lifted up its lamps, just as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\v 4 And this {is} the work of the lampstand: a hammered gold work; it {was} a hammered work up to its base, up to its blossom. According to the appearance that Yahweh showed Moses, so he made the lampstand.

\p
\v 5 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 6 “Take the Levites from the midst of the sons of Israel and make them clean.

\v 7 And thus you shall do to them to make them clean: Sprinkle on them the water of the sin offering. And they shall pass a razor over all their body, and they shall wash their garments, and they shall make themselves clean.
\v 8 And they shall take a bull, a son of cattle, and its grain offering of fine flour mixed with the oil. And you shall take a second bull, a son of cattle, for a sin offering.
\v 9 And you shall bring the Levites near before the face of the tent of meeting. And you shall assemble all the congregation of the sons of Israel.
\v 10 And you shall bring the Levites near before the face of Yahweh, and the sons of Israel shall lay their hands on the Levites.
\v 11 And Aaron shall wave the Levites as a wave offering before the face of Yahweh from with the sons of Israel. And they shall be for serving the service of Yahweh.
\v 12 And the Levites shall lay their hands on the head of the bulls and make the one as a sin offering and the one as a burnt offering to Yahweh, to make atonement for the Levites.
\v 13 And you shall stand the Levites before the face of Aaron and before the face of his sons, and you shall wave them as a wave offering to Yahweh.

\p
\v 14 And you shall separate the Levites from the midst of the sons of Israel, and the Levites shall be for me.
\v 15 And afterwards the Levites shall enter to serve the tent of meeting. And you shall make them clean and you shall wave them as a wave offering,
\v 16 for they are given, given to me from the midst of the sons of Israel. Instead of the opener of every womb, the firstborn of all from the sons of Israel, I have taken them for myself.

\v 17 For every firstborn among the sons of Israel, among the human and among the livestock, belongs to me. On the day of my striking every firstborn in the land of Egypt, I set them apart for me.

\v 18 And I have taken the Levites instead of every firstborn among the sons of Israel.
\v 19 And I have given the Levites as given ones to Aaron and to his sons, from the midst of the sons of Israel, to serve the service of the sons of Israel in the tent of meeting and to make atonement for the sons of Israel. And there shall be no plague among the sons of Israel at the coming of the sons of Israel to the holy place.”

\p
\v 20 And Moses and Aaron and all the assembly of the sons of Israel did to the Levites according to all that Yahweh had commanded Moses for the Levites; so the sons of Israel did to them.
\v 21 And the Levites purified themselves of sin, and they washed their garments, and Aaron waved them as a wave offering before the face of Yahweh, and Aaron made atonement for them to make them clean.

\v 22 And afterward the Levites entered to serve their service in the tent of meeting before the face of Aaron and before the face of his sons. Just as Yahweh had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so he did to them.
\p
\v 23 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 24 “This is what is for the Levites: From a son of 25 years and above he shall enter to work work in the service of the tent of meeting.
\v 25 And from a son of 50 years he shall return from the work of the service, and he shall not serve more.
\v 26 And he shall attend his brothers in the tent of meeting to keep responsibility, but service he shall not serve. Thus you shall do for the Levites in their responsibilities.”



\c 9
\p
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the second year of their going out from the land of Egypt, in the first month, saying,
\v 2 “And let the sons of Israel do the Passover at its appointed time.
\v 3 On day 14 in this month, between the evenings, you shall do it at its appointed time. According to all its statutes and according to all its ordinances you shall do it.”

\v 4 And Moses spoke to the sons of Israel to do the Passover.
\v 5 And they did the Passover in the first, on day 14 of the month, between the evenings, in the wilderness of Sinai. According to all that Yahweh had commanded Moses, so did the sons of Israel.

\v 6 And there were men who were unclean by the body of a man, and they were not able to do the Passover on that day. And they came near before the face of Moses and before the face of Aaron on that day.
\v 7 And those men said to him, “We are unclean by the body of a man. Why are we restrained to not offer an offering of Yahweh at its appointed time in the midst of the sons of Israel?”
\v 8 And Moses said to them, “Stand and I shall hear what Yahweh commands for you.”
\p
\v 9 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 10 “Speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘If a man, a man is unclean by a body or is on a distant road, for you or for your generations, then he may do the Passover to Yahweh.

\v 11 In the second month on day 14 between the evenings, they shall do it. With unleavened bread and bitter herbs they shall eat it.
\v 12 They shall not leave some of it until morning, and a bone they shall not break in it. According to every statute of the Passover they shall do it.

\v 13 And the man, he who is clean and is not on a road, but ceases to do the Passover, now that person shall be cut off from his people because he did not offer the offering of Yahweh at its appointed time. That man shall carry his sin.
\v 14 And if a sojourner sojourns with you and does the Passover to Yahweh according to the statute of the Passover and according to its ordinance, so he shall do. One statute shall be for you and for the sojourner and for the native of the land.’”

\p
\v 15 And on the day of raising up the Dwelling, the cloud covered the Dwelling of the tent of the testimony, and in the evening it was above the Dwelling like the appearance of fire until morning.
\v 16 So it was continually; the cloud covered it, and the appearance of fire at night.
\v 17 And according to the mouth the cloud was lifted from above the tent, then afterward the sons of Israel set out. And in the place there where the cloud dwelled, there the sons of Israel camped.

\v 18 In accordance with the mouth of Yahweh the sons of Israel set out, and in accordance with the mouth of Yahweh they camped. They camped all the days that the cloud dwelled above the Dwelling.
\v 19 And when the cloud prolonged above the Dwelling many days, then the sons of Israel kept the keeping of Yahweh and did not set out.
\v 20 And it was when the cloud was days of number above the Dwelling, they camped in accordance with the mouth of Yahweh, and they set out in accordance with the mouth of Yahweh.
\v 21 And it was when the cloud was from evening until morning and the cloud was taken up in the morning then they set out; or in the daytime and night, and the cloud was taken up, then they set out.

\v 22 Whether two days or a month or days, when the cloud prolonged above the Dwelling to dwell above it, the sons of Israel camped and did not set out. And when it was taken up, they set out.
\v 23 They camped in accordance with the mouth of Yahweh, and they set out in accordance with the mouth of Yahweh. They kept the keeping of Yahweh, in accordance with the mouth of Yahweh by the hand of Moses.


\c 10
\p
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 2 “Make for you two trumpets of silver. You shall make them hammered work, and they shall be for you for the calling of the congregation and for pulling up the camps,
\v 3 and they shall blow them and they shall congregate themselves to you, all the congregation, to the opening of the tent of meeting.

\v 4 And if they blow one, then the leaders, the heads of the thousands of Israel, shall congregate themselves to you,
\v 5 and you shall blow a blast and the camps camping to the east shall set out,
\v 6 and you shall blow a second blast and the camps camping to the south shall set out. They shall blow a blast for their setting out,
\v 7 and when assembling the assembly, you shall blow but you shall not blast.

\v 8 And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets, and it shall be for you for a statute forever, for your generations.
\v 9 And when you enter battle in your land against the opponents who oppose you, then you shall blast the trumpets, and you shall be remembered before the face of Yahweh your God, and you shall be saved from your enemies.
\v 10 And on a day of your joy and at your appointed times and at the heads of your months, then you shall blow the trumpets with your burnt offerings and with the sacrifices of your peace offerings, and it will be for you for a memorial before the face of your God. I am Yahweh your God.”
\p
\v 11 And it happened that in the second year, in the second month, on 20 in the month, the cloud was taken up from above the Dwelling of the Testimony.
\v 12 And the sons of Israel set out from the wilderness of Sinai according to their tribes, and the cloud dwelled in the wilderness of Paran,
\v 13 and they set out at the first in accordance with the mouth of Yahweh by the hand of Moses.

\v 14 And the banner of the camp of the sons of Judah set out at the first according to their armies: and over his army was Nahson the son of Amminadab,
\v 15 and over the army of the tribe of the sons of Issachar was Nethanel the son of Zuar,
\v 16 and over the army of the tribe of the sons of Zebulun was Eliab the son of Helon.

\v 17 And the Dwelling was taken down, and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, the lifters of the Dwelling, set out.
\v 18 And the banner of the tribe of Reuben set out according to their armies: and over his company was Elizur the son of Shedeur,
\v 19 and over the army of the tribe of the sons of Simeon was Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai,
\v 20 and over the army of the tribe of the sons of Gad was Eliasaph the son of Deuel.

\p
\v 21 And the Kohathites, lifters of the holy place, set out, and they raised up the Dwelling until their coming.
\v 22 And the banner of the camp of the sons of Ephraim set out according to their armies, and over his army was Elishama the son of Ammihud,
\v 23 and over the army of the tribe of the sons of Manasseh was Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur,
\v 24 and over the army of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin was Abidan the son of Gideoni.

\v 25 And the banner of the camp of the sons of Dan, gatherer for all the camps according to their armies, set out, and over his army was Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.
\v 26 And over the army of the tribe of the sons of Asher was Pagiel the son of Okran,
\v 27 and over the army of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali was Ahira the son of Enan.
\v 28 These were the tribes of the sons of Israel according to their armies. And they set out.

\p
\v 29 And Moses said to Hobab, the son of Reuel the Midianite, the father-in-law of Moses, “We are about to set out to the place that Yahweh said, ‘I shall give it to you.’ Go with us, and we will do good to you. For Yahweh has spoken good for Israel.”
\v 30 And he said to him, “I will not go, but I will go to my land and to my family.”

\v 31 And he said, “Please do not leave us! Because you know our camping in the wilderness, and you could be for eyes for us.
\v 32 And it will happen that if you go with us, then it will happen that that good which Yahweh shall do good with us, even we will do good to you.”

\p
\v 33 And they set out from the mountain of Yahweh a road of three days, and the box of the covenant of Yahweh was setting out before the face of them a road of three days, to seek out for them a resting place,
\v 34 and the cloud of Yahweh was over them by day when they set out from the camp.
\p
\v 35 And it happened, when the box set out, that Moses said, “Rise up, Yahweh, and your enemies will be scattered, and those who hate you will flee from your face.”
\v 36 And when it rested, he said, “Return, Yahweh, to the multitudes of the thousands of Israel.”



\c 11
\p
\v 1 And when the people were complaining it was evil in the ears of Yahweh, and Yahweh heard and his nose burned, and the fire of Yahweh burned among them, and it ate at the end of the camp.
\v 2 And the people cried out to Moses, and Moses prayed to Yahweh and the fire sank;
\v 3 and the name of that place was called Taberah, for the fire of Yahweh burned among them.
\p
\v 4 And the gathered rabble that was in its inner part desired a desire, and they turned back, and they wept, also the sons of Israel. And they said, “Who will let us eat meat?
\v 5 We remember the fish that we ate in Egypt for nothing, the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic.
\v 6 And now our life is dried up, there is not anything except for the manna in our eyes.”

\v 7 And the manna, it was like the seed of coriander, and its eye was like the eye of bdellium.
\v 8 The people went around and picked up and ground with the handmill or crushed with the mortar and boiled in the pot and made it cakes, and its taste was like the taste of the delicacy of the oil,
\v 9 and when the dew came down on the camp at night, the manna came down on it.
\v 10 And Moses heard the people weeping according to its clans, a man to the opening of his tent; and the nose of Yahweh burned exceedingly, and it was evil in the eyes of Moses.
\v 11 And Moses said to Yahweh, “Why do you do evil to your servant? And why have I not found favor in your eyes, by putting the burden of all this people on me?
\v 12 Did I conceive all of this people? Did I give birth to him so that you could say to me, ‘Carry him in your bosom just as the one who nourishes carries the one who sucks over the ground that you have sworn to his fathers?’

\v 13 From where is meat for me to give to all of this people? For they weep beside me, saying, ‘Give to us meat and let us eat.’
\v 14 I am not able by myself to carry all of this people, for they are heavier than me.
\v 15 And if you are going to do thus to me, please slay me quickly, if I have found favor in your eyes, and do not let me look on my evil.”

\p
\v 16 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Gather for me 70 men from the elders of Israel whom you know, so that they will be elders of the people and its officers, and take them to the tent of meeting, and they shall station themselves there with you.
\v 17 And I will come down and speak with you there, and I will withdraw some of the spirit that is on you and put it on them, and they will carry with you the burden of the people, and you will not carry by yourself.

\v 18 And to the people you shall say, ‘Make yourselves holy for tomorrow, and you shall eat meat. For you have wept in the ears of Yahweh, saying, “Who will let us eat meat? For it was good for us in Egypt.” And Yahweh will give to you meat, and you will eat.
\v 19 You will eat not one day and not two days and not five days and not ten days and not twenty days,
\v 20 until a month of days, until when it goes out from your nose. And it shall be for disgust for you, because that you rejected Yahweh who is in the midst of you, and you wept before his face, saying, “Why this—we went out from Egypt?”’”

\v 21 And Moses said, “The people are 600, 000 on foot who I am in the midst of, and you have said, ‘I shall give to them meat and they shall eat a month of days.’
\v 22 Shall flock and herd be slaughtered for them and one find for them? If all the fish of the sea were gathered for them, then will one find for them?”
\v 23 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Is the hand of Yahweh short? Now you will see whether my word will happen to you or not.”

\p
\v 24 And Moses went out and he spoke to the people the words of Yahweh. And he gathered 70 men from the elders of the people, and he had them stand round about the tent.
\v 25 And Yahweh came down in the cloud and he spoke to him, and he withdrew some of the spirit that was on him, and he put it on 70 men, the elders. And it happened when the spirit rested on them that they prophesied but did not again.
\p
\v 26 And two of the men were left in the camp: The name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the second was Medad. And the spirit rested on them, and they were among the written down ones, but they had not gone out to the tent; and they prophesied in the camp.
\v 27 And the young man ran and reported to Moses, and he said, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp.”

\v 28 And Joshua the son of Nun, the server of Moses from his youth, responded and said, “My master Moses, restrain them.”
\v 29 And Moses said to him, “Are you being jealous for me? And if only he would make all the people of Yahweh prophets, that Yahweh would put his Spirit on them!”
\v 30 And Moses withdrew to the camp, he and the elders of Israel.

\p
\v 31 And a wind set out from with Yahweh, and it brought over quail from the sea, and it left on the camp like a road of a day here and like a road of a day here, round about the camp, and like two cubits on the face of the land.
\v 32 And the people rose all that day and all the night and all the day of the next day, and they gathered the quail. The one who did little gathered ten homers. And they spread out for them, spreading out round about the camp.

\v 33 The meat was still between their teeth–before it was chewed–and the nose of Yahweh burned against the people, and Yahweh struck the people an exceedingly great blow,
\v 34 and he called the name of that place Kibroth Hattaavah, because there they buried the people who had desired.
\v 35 From Kibroth Hattaavah the people set out to Hazeroth. Then they were in Hazeroth.



\c 12
\p
\v 1 And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses on account of the Cushite wife that he had taken, because he had taken a Cushite wife.
\v 2 And they said, “Has Yahweh really only spoken with Moses? Has he not spoken also with us?” And Yahweh heard.
\v 3 (And the man Moses was exceedingly humble, more than every human who was on the face of the ground.)

\p
\v 4 And Yahweh said immediately to Moses and to Aaron and to Miriam, “The three of you go out to the tent of meeting,” and the three of them went out.
\v 5 And Yahweh came down in a column of cloud, and he stood at the opening of the tent, and he called Aaron and Miriam and the two of them went out.
\v 6 And he said, “Hear now my words! If one is your prophet, I, Yahweh will make myself known to him in the vision. I will speak with him in the dream.
\q 
\v 7 Not so my servant Moses; he is trustworthy in all my house.
\q 
\v 8 I speak with him mouth to mouth, and with appearance, and not with riddles; and he looks at the form of Yahweh. And why are you not afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?”

\p
\v 9 And the nose of Yahweh burned against them and he went,
\v 10 and the cloud departed from over the tent. And behold, Miriam was with a skin disease, like the snow, and Aaron turned to Miriam, and behold, she was with a skin disease,
\v 11 and Aaron said to Moses, “Please, my master, please do not put on us sin which we did foolishly and which we sinned.
\v 12 Please do not let her be like the dead one who, when he comes out from the womb of his mother, then half of his flesh is eaten.”
\v 13 And Moses cried out to Yahweh, saying, “God, please, please heal her!”
\v 14 And Yahweh said to Moses, “If her father surely spit in her face, would she not be humiliated seven days? She shall be shut up seven days from outside of the camp, and afterward she may be brought in.”
\v 15 And Miriam was shut up from outside of the camp seven days, and the people did not set out until the bringing in of Miriam.

\p
\v 16 And after, the people set out from Hazeroth, and they camped in the wilderness of Paran.



\c 13
\p
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 2 “Send for yourself men, and they shall explore the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the sons of Israel. You shall send one man by one man according to the tribe of his fathers, every leader among them.”

\v 3 And Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran in accordance with the mouth of Yahweh. All of them were men, they were the heads of the sons of Israel,
\v 4 and these are their names: of the tribe of Reuben was Shammua the son of Zaccur;

\v 5 of the tribe of Simeon was Shaphat the son of Hori;
\v 6 of the tribe of Judah was Caleb the son of Jephunneh;
\v 7 of the tribe of Issachar was Igal the son of Joseph;
\v 8 of the tribe of Ephraim was Hoshea the son of Nun;

\v 9 of the tribe of Benjamin was Palti the son of Raphu;
\v 10 of the tribe of Zebulun was Gaddiel the son of Sodi;
\v 11 of the tribe of Joseph, of the tribe of Manasseh, was Gaddi the son of Susi;
\v 12 of the tribe of Dan was Ammiel the son of Gemalli;

\v 13 of the tribe of Asher was Sethur the son of Michael;
\v 14 of the tribe of Naphtali was Nahbi the son of Vophsi;
\v 15 of the tribe of Gad was Geuel the son of Maki.
\v 16 These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to explore the land; and Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun, Joshua.

\p
\v 17 And Moses sent them to explore the land of Canaan, and he said to them, “Go up here through the Negev, and you shall go up the hill country.
\v 18 And you shall see the land, how it is; and the people who dwell on it, whether he is strong or weak, whether he is few or many;
\v 19 and how is the land in which he is dwelling, whether it is good or evil; and how are the cities in which he is dwelling, whether in camps or in fortifications;
\v 20 and how is the land, whether it is fat or lean, whether there are trees in it or not, and you shall strengthen yourselves, and you shall take from the fruit of the land.” (And the days were the days of the firstfruits of the grapes.)

\p
\v 21 And they went up, and they explored the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, to enter Hamath.
\v 22 And they went up through the Negev and they came to Hebron. And Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, those born of the Anak, were there. (And Hebron had been built seven years before Zoan of Egypt.)

\v 23 And they came to the wadi of Eschol, and from there they cut a branch and one cluster of grapes, and they carried it by the carrying pole with two men, and some of the pomegranates and some of the figs.
\v 24 He called that place the wadi of Eshkol on account of the cluster that the sons of Israel cut from there.

\p
\v 25 And they returned from exploring the land at the end of 40 days,
\v 26 and they went and they came to Moses and to Aaron and to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, to the wilderness of Paran at Kadesh. And they brought back them and all the congregation word, and they showed them the fruit of the land,

\v 27 and they recounted to him, and they said, “We entered into the land where you sent us, and it is certainly flowing with milk and honey, and this is its fruit.
\v 28 However, the people who dwell in the land are fierce, and the cities are fortified very large, and also we saw those born of the Anak there.
\v 29 Amalek is dwelling in the land of the Negev, and the Hittite and the Jebusite and the Amorite is dwelling in the hill country, and the Canaanite is dwelling beside the sea and beside the hand of the Jordan.”

\p
\v 30 And Caleb hushed the people near Moses and he said, “We will certainly go up and take possession of it, for we are certainly able to prevail over it.”
\v 31 And the men who went up with him said, “We are not able to go up against the people, because he is stronger than us,”

\v 32 and they caused an evil report of the land, it that they had explored, to go out to the sons of Israel, saying, “The land in which we passed through to explore it, it is a land that eats those who dwell in it. And all the people whom we saw in the midst of it were men of size,
\v 33 and there we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak from the Nephilim, and we were like grasshoppers in our eyes, and so we were in their eyes.”



\c 14
\p
\v 1 And all the congregation lifted up and gave their voice, and the people wept in that night.
\v 2 And all the sons of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron. And all the congregation said to them, “If only we had died in the land of Egypt, or if only we had died in this wilderness!
\v 3 And why is Yahweh bringing us to this land to fall by the sword? Our wives and our children will be for plunder. Is it not good for us to return to Egypt?”

\p
\v 4 And they said, a man to his brother, “Let us set a head, and let us return to Egypt.”
\v 5 And Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before the face of all the assembly of the congregation of the sons of Israel,
\v 6 and Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, from the ones who explored the land, tore their garments,
\v 7 and they spoke to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, saying, “The land in which we passed through to explore it is a very exceedingly good land.
\v 8 If Yahweh delights in us, then he will bring us into this land, and he will give it to us, a land that is flowing with milk and honey.

\v 9 Only you shall not rebel against Yahweh, and you shall not fear the people of the land, for they are our food. He has turned their shadow from over them, and Yahweh is with us. You shall not fear them!”
\v 10 And all the congregation said to stone them with stones. But the glory of Yahweh appeared in the tent of meeting to all the sons of Israel.

\p
\v 11 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Until when will this people spurn me? And until when will they not trust in me, despite all the signs that I have done in the midst of them?
\v 12 I will strike him down with the plague, and I will disinherit him, and I will make you into a nation greater and more numerous than them.”

\p
\v 13 And Moses said to Yahweh, “And the Egyptians have heard that you brought this people up with your power from the midst of him.
\v 14 And they have spoken to those dwelling in this land. They have heard that you, Yahweh, are in the midst of this people; that you, Yahweh, have been seen eye by eye, and your cloud is standing over them, and in a column of cloud you are going before their face by day and in a column of fire at night.

\v 15 If you kill this people like one man, then the nations will say that they heard a report of you, saying,
\v 16 ‘Because Yahweh was not able to bring this people into the land that he swore to them, so he slaughtered them in the wilderness.’

\v 17 And now, please let the power of my Lord be great, just as you have spoken, saying,
\v 18 ‘Yahweh is long of nostrils and abundant of covenant faithfulness, lifting up iniquity and transgression. But surely he will not leave unpunished, appointing the iniquity of fathers on sons, on thirds, and on fourths.’
\v 19 Please forgive this people of the iniquity according to the greatness of your covenant faithfulness, and just as you have lifted up this people, from Egypt and to here.”

\p
\v 20 And Yahweh said, “I have forgiven according to your word.
\v 21 But truly, I live, and all the earth will be filled with the glory of Yahweh.
\v 22 For all the men who have seen my glory and my signs that I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and they tested me this ten times and have not listened to my voice,

\v 23 if they see the land that I have sworn to their fathers…and all those who spurn me will not see it.
\v 24 But my servant Caleb, because another spirit is with him, and he was fully after me, I will bring him into the land that he will come to there, and his seed will inherit it.
\v 25 (And the Amalekite and the Canaanite were dwelling in the valley.) Tomorrow turn and set out for yourselves to the wilderness, the way of the Sea of Reeds.”

\p
\v 26 And Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
\v 27 “Until when must I listen to this evil congregation, they who are murmuring against me the murmurings of the sons of Israel, they who are murmuring against me?

\v 28 Say to them, ‘{As} I live,’–the declaration of Yahweh–‘surely just as you have spoken in my ears, so I will do to you:
\v 29 In this wilderness your corpses will fall and all your counted ones according to all your number, from a son of 20 years and upward, who have murmured against me.
\v 30 If you enter into the land that I have lifted up my hand to make you dwell in … except Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun,
\v 31 and your children who you said would be for plunder; and I will bring them, and they will know the land, it that you have rejected.
\v 32 And you, your corpses will fall in this wilderness,
\v 33 and your sons will be those who herd in the wilderness 40 years, and they will carry your fornications until the finishing of your corpses in the wilderness.

\v 34 By the number of the days that you explored the land, 40 days, a day for the year, a day for the year, you will carry your iniquities 40 years. And you will know my opposition.
\v 35 I, Yahweh, have spoken. Surely I will do this to all this evil congregation, the ones who have congregated themselves against me. In this wilderness they will finish, and there they will die.’”

\p
\v 36 And the men whom Moses had sent to explore the land and had returned and caused all the congregation to murmur against him by causing an evil report against the land to go out,
\v 37 even the men who had caused to go out the evil report of the evil land, died by the plague before the face of Yahweh.
\v 38 But Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh lived from those men, the ones who went to explore the land.

\p
\v 39 And Moses spoke these words to all the sons of Israel, and the people mourned exceedingly,
\v 40 and they rose early in the morning and went up to the head of the mountain, saying, “Here we are, and we will go up to the place that Yahweh has said, for we have sinned.”

\v 41 And Moses said, “Why this—are you passing over the mouth of Yahweh? And it will not succeed.
\v 42 You shall not go up, because Yahweh is not in the midst of you, that you not be struck down before the face of your enemies.
\v 43 For the Amalekite and the Canaanite are there before your face, and you will fall by the sword, for you have turned from after Yahweh, and therefore Yahweh will not be with you.”

\v 44 And they presumed to go up to the head of the mountain, but the box of the covenant of Yahweh and Moses did not depart from the midst of the camp.
\v 45 And the Amalekite and the Canaanite who dwelled on that mountain, came down. And they smote them and beat them to pieces as far as the Hormah.



\c 15
\p
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 2 “Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘When you enter into the land of your dwellings, which I am giving to you,
\v 3 then you shall make an offering made by fire to Yahweh, a burnt offering or a sacrifice, to do an extraordinary vow or with a voluntary offering, or at your appointed times, to make an aroma of soothing for Yahweh from the herd or from the flock.

\v 4 And the one who is offering shall offer his offering to Yahweh, a grain offering, a tenth of fine flour mixed with a fourth of the hin of oil.
\v 5 And wine for the drink offering, a fourth of the hin, you shall make with the burnt offering or for the sacrifice, for the one male lamb.

\v 6 Or for the ram you shall make a grain offering, two tenths fine flour mixed with a third of the hin of oil.
\v 7 And wine for the drink offering, a third of the hin, you shall offer as an aroma of soothing for Yahweh.

\v 8 And when you make a son of cattle a burnt offering or a sacrifice, to do an extraordinary vow or peace offerings to Yahweh,
\v 9 then you shall offer with the son of the cattle a grain offering, three tenths fine flour mixed with a half of the hin of the oil,
\v 10 and you shall offer a half of the hin of wine for the drink offering, an offering made by fire, an aroma of soothing for Yahweh.

\p
\v 11 Thus it shall be done for the one ox or for the one ram or for the small livestock among the male lambs or among the goats.
\v 12 According to the number that you do, thus you shall do for the one according to their number.
\v 13 Every native shall do these things thus for offering an offering made by fire, an aroma of soothing for Yahweh.

\v 14 And if a sojourner sojourns with you, or whoever is in the midst of you for your generations, and he makes an offering made by fire, an aroma of soothing for Yahweh, just as you shall do, so he shall do.
\v 15 The assembly statute is one for you and for the sojourner, the one who is sojourning, a statute of eternity for your generations. As you, so the sojourner shall be before the face of Yahweh.
\v 16 One instruction and one ordinance shall be for you and for the sojourner, the one who is sojourning with you.’”

\p
\v 17 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 18 “Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘When you enter into the land there to which I am bringing you,
\v 19 and it shall be that when you eat from the bread of the land, you shall raise a raised offering to Yahweh.

\v 20 The first of your dough shall be a cake you shall raise as a raised offering. Like a raised offering of the threshing floor, so you shall raise it.
\v 21 From the first of your dough you shall give a raised offering to Yahweh for your generations.
\p
\v 22 And when you stray and do not do all these commandments that Yahweh has spoken to Moses,
\v 23 all that Yahweh has commanded to you by the hand of Moses, from the day that Yahweh commanded and beyond for your generations,
\v 24 and it shall be that, if it was done as unintentional sin away from the eyes of the congregation, then all the congregation shall make a bull, one son of cattle, for a burnt offering, for an aroma of soothing for Yahweh, and its grain offering and its drink offering, according to the ordinance, and one buck of the goats for a sin offering.

\v 25 And the priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the sons of Israel, and it shall be forgiven for them, for it was an unintentional sin, and they have brought their offering, an offering made by fire, to Yahweh, and their sin offering before the face of Yahweh for their unintentional sin.
\v 26 And it shall be forgiven for all the congregation of the sons of Israel and for the sojourner, the one who is sojourning in the midst of them, because of all the people with unintentional sin.
\p
\v 27 And if one person sins with an unintentional sin, then he shall offer a female goat, a daughter of its year, for a sin offering.
\v 28 And the priest shall make atonement for the person, the one who sinned unintentionally with a sin, with an unintentional sin, before the face of Yahweh, to make atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven for him.
\v 29 The native among the sons of Israel and for the sojourner, the one who is sojourning in the midst of them, one instruction shall be for you for the one who does an unintentional sin.
\v 30 But the person who does with a raised hand, from the native and from the sojourner, he is blaspheming Yahweh, and that person shall be cut off from the midst of his people,
\v 31 because he has despised the word of Yahweh and has broken his commandment, that person shall certainly be cut off. His iniquity shall be on him.’”

\p
\v 32 And the sons of Israel were in the wilderness, and they found a man gathering pieces of wood on the day of the Sabbath,
\v 33 and the ones who found him gathering pieces of wood brought him near to Moses and to Aaron and to all the congregation,
\v 34 and they made him rest in the keeping place, because it had not been declared what should be done to him.
\v 35 And Yahweh said to Moses, “The man shall certainly die, all the congregation stoning him with the stones from the outside of the camp.”
\v 36 And all the congregation brought him out to the outside of the camp, and they stoned him with the stones and he died, just as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\p
\v 37 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 38 “Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘And they shall make for themselves a tassel on the wings of their garments for their generations, and they shall put a cord of blue on the tassel of the wing,
\v 39 and it shall be for you for a tassel, and you shall see it, and you shall remember all the commandments of Yahweh, and you shall do them. And you shall not explore after your heart and after your eyes, them which you are prostituting after,
\v 40 so that you shall remember and do all my commandments. And you shall be holy ones for your God.
\v 41 I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out from the land of Egypt, to become a God for you. I am Yahweh your God.”



\c 16
\p
\v 1 And Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, the sons of Reuben, took men,
\v 2 and they rose up before the face of Moses with men from the sons of Israel, 250 leaders of the congregation, the called ones of the appointed meeting, men of name,
\v 3 and they assembled against Moses and against Aaron. And they said to them, “It is much for you! For all of the congregation, all of them, are holy and Yahweh is in their midst. And why do you lift up yourselves above the assembly of Yahweh?”

\p
\v 4 And Moses heard and fell on his face.
\v 5 And he spoke to Korah and to all his congregation, saying, “And in the morning Yahweh will make known who belongs to him and is the holy one and whom he will bring near to him. And him whom he chooses he will bring near to him.
\v 6 Do this: Korah and all his congregation, take for yourselves censers,
\v 7 and put fire in them, and set incense on them before the face of Yahweh tomorrow. And it will happen that the man whom Yahweh chooses, he will be the holy one. It is much for you, sons of Levi!”
\v 8 And Moses said to Korah, “Now listen, sons of Levi:
\v 9 Is it a small thing for you that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel to bring you near to him to serve the service of the Dwelling of Yahweh and to stand before the face of the congregation to minister to them?
\v 10 And he has brought you near, and all your brothers, the sons of Levi, with you. And you are seeking the priesthood also!
\v 11 Therefore, you and all your congregation are the ones congregating against Yahweh, and Aaron, what is he that you grumble against him?”

\p
\v 12 And Moses sent to call for Dathan and for Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and they said, “We will not go up.
\v 13 Is it a small thing that you have brought us up from a land flowing with milk and honey to make us die in the wilderness? But you have made yourself ruler over us, even to make yourself ruler!
\v 14 Moreover, you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, or given to us an inheritance of field or vineyard. Will you gouge out the eyes of these men? We will not go up.”

\p
\v 15 And it burned exceedingly for Moses, and he said to Yahweh, “Do not turn to their offering. I have not taken one donkey from them. And I have not harmed one of them.”
\v 16 And Moses said to Korah, “You and all your congregation be before the face of Yahweh, you and they and Aaron, tomorrow,
\v 17 and take a man his censer, and put incense on them, and bring before the face of Yahweh, a man his censer, 250 censers, and you and Aaron, a man his censer.”

\v 18 And they took a man his censer, and they put fire on it and set incense on it, and they stood at the opening of the tent of meeting with Moses and Aaron.
\v 19 And Korah assembled all the congregation against them at the opening of the tent of meeting, and the glory of Yahweh appeared to all the congregation.

\p
\v 20 And Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
\v 21 “Separate yourselves from the midst of this congregation, and I shall finish them in a moment.”
\v 22 And they fell on their faces and said, “God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, will one man sin and you become furious against all the congregation?”

\v 23 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 24 “Speak to the congregation, saying, ‘Get yourselves up from around the dwellings of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.’”

\p
\v 25 And Moses rose and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel went after him.
\v 26 And he spoke to the congregation, saying, “Now turn from beside the tents of these wicked men and do not touch anything that belongs to them, lest you be swept away by all their sins.”
\v 27 And they got themselves up from beside the dwelling of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, from all around, and Dathan and Abiram went out, standing at the opening of their tents with their wives and their sons and their little children.
\v 28 And Moses said, “By this you will know that Yahweh has sent me to do all these deeds, that they are not from my heart:
\v 29 If these ones die like the death of every man and the appointment of every man is appointed to them, Yahweh has not sent me.
\v 30 But if Yahweh creates a creation and the ground opens its mouth and swallows them and all that belongs to them and they go down alive to Sheol, then you will know that these men have spurned Yahweh.”
\p
\v 31 And it happened when he finished speaking all these words that the ground that was under them split open.
\v 32 And the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them and their houses and every man who belonged to Korah and all the property.
\v 33 And they went down to Sheol alive, they and all that belonged to them, and the earth covered over them and they perished from the midst of the assembly.
\v 34 And all Israel who was surrounding them fled from their sound, for they said, “Lest the earth swallow us!”
\v 35 And fire went out from with Yahweh, and it ate the 250 men offering the incense.
\p
\v 36 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 37 “Say to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, and he shall lift up the censers from between the burning and scatter the fire abroad, for they are holy.
\v 38 And the censers of these sinners against their lives, make them hammered sheets of thin metal, plating for the altar. For they offered them before the face of Yahweh, and they are holy, and they shall be for a sign for the sons of Israel.”

\p
\v 39 And Eleazar the priest took the censers of bronze that the burned ones had offered, and they hammered them as a plating for the altar,
\v 40 a reminder for the sons of Israel, so that an unfamiliar man, he who is not from the seed of Aaron, shall not come near to burn incense before the face of Yahweh, and he shall not be like Korah and his congregation, just as Yahweh spoke by the hand of Moses to him.

\p
\v 41 And all the congregation of the sons of Israel grumbled against Moses and against Aaron from the next day, saying, “You yourselves killed the people of Yahweh!”
\v 42 And it happened when the congregation assembled against Moses and against Aaron that they turned to the tent of meeting, and behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of Yahweh was seen.
\v 43 And Moses and Aaron came to the face of the tent of meeting,
\v 44 and Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 45 “Get yourselves up from the midst of this congregation, and I shall finish them in a moment,” and they fell on their faces.
\v 46 And Moses said to Aaron, “Take the censer, and put fire on it from on the altar, and set incense, and go quickly into the congregation, and make atonement for them, because the wrath has gone out from before the face of Yahweh. The plague has begun.”
\v 47 And Aaron took just as Moses said and ran into the midst of the assembly. And behold, the plague had begun among the people. And he put the incense and made atonement for the people.
\v 48 And he stood between the ones who died and the ones who lived. And the plague was stopped.
\v 49 And the ones who died by the plague were 14, 700, apart from the ones who died on account of the matter of Korah.
\v 50 And Aaron returned to Moses, to the opening of the tent of meeting, and the plague was stopped.


\c 17
\p
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 2 “Speak to the sons of Israel, and take a staff from with them, a staff for the house of a father, from with all their leaders for the house of their fathers, 12 staffs. You shall write a man his name on his staff,

\v 3 and you shall write the name of Aaron on the staff of Levi; for one staff is for the head of the house of their fathers,
\v 4 and you shall rest them in the tent of meeting, before the face of the testimony, there where I meet with you.
\v 5 And it will happen that the man, him whom I choose, his staff will bud. And I will make the grumblings of the sons of Israel that they are grumbling against you cease from against me.”

\v 6 And Moses spoke to the sons of Israel, and all their leaders gave to him a staff for one leader, a staff for one leader, for the house of their fathers, 12 staffs, and the staff of Aaron was in the midst of their staffs;
\v 7 and Moses rested the staffs before the face of Yahweh in the tent of testimony.
\p
\v 8 And it happened from the next day that Moses came into the tent of the testimony, and behold, the staff of Aaron for the house of Levi had budded, and it brought out a bud, and it blossomed a flower, and it ripened almonds!
\v 9 And Moses brought out all the staffs from before the face of Yahweh to all the sons of Israel. And they saw and took, a man his staff.
\v 10 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Return the staff of Aaron to the face of the testimony for keeping for a sign for the sons of rebellion, and you shall end their grumblings from against me, and they shall not die.”
\v 11 And Moses did just as Yahweh had commanded him, thus he did.

\p
\v 12 And the sons of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, “Look, we will expire! We will perish! All of us will perish!
\v 13 All who come near, who come near to the Dwelling of Yahweh die. Will we be finished by expiring?”


\c 18
\p
\v 1 And Yahweh said to Aaron, “You and your sons and the house of your father with you shall bear the iniquity of the holy place; and you and your sons with you shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood.
\v 2 And also bring with you your brothers, the staff of Levi, the tribe of your father, and they shall be joined to you and serve you; and you and your sons with you shall be before the face of the tent of the testimony.
\v 3 And they shall keep your keeping and the keeping of all of the tent. However, they shall not come near to the vessels of the holy place or to the altar, and they will not die, both them and you.
\v 4 And they shall be joined to you and shall keep the keeping of the tent of meeting, for all the service of the tent; and a stranger shall not come near to you;
\v 5 and you shall keep the keeping of the holy place and the keeping of the altar, and there shall not again be fury against the sons of Israel.
\v 6 And I, behold, I have taken your brothers the Levites from the midst of the sons of Israel as a gift for you, ones given to Yahweh to serve the service of the tent of meeting.
\v 7 And you and your sons with you shall keep your priesthood for all the things of the altar and for the inside of the curtain, and you shall serve. I have given your priesthood as a gift of service, and a stranger who comes near shall be put to death.”
\p
\v 8 And Yahweh spoke to Aaron, “And I, behold, I have given to you the keeping of my contribution, of all the holy things of the sons of Israel I have given them to you for a portion and to your sons for a statute of eternity.
\v 9 This will belong to you from the holiest holy thing from the fire: every offering of theirs, of every grain offering of theirs and of every sin offering of theirs and of every guilt offering of theirs which they return to me, a holiest holy thing it is for you and for your sons.
\v 10 You shall eat it as a holiest holy thing. Every male shall eat it. It is holy for you.
\v 11 And this belongs to you: the contribution of their gift, of all the wave offerings of the sons of Israel, I have given them to you and to your sons and to your daughters with you for a statute of eternity. Every clean one in your house shall eat it.

\v 12 All the fat of fresh oil and all the fat of new wine and grain, their firstfruits which they will give to Yahweh, I have given them to you.
\v 13 The firstfruits of all that is in the land which they will bring to Yahweh will belong to you. Every clean one in your house shall eat it.
\v 14 Every dedicated thing in Israel will belong to you.
\v 15 Every opener of the womb of all flesh that they offer to Yahweh, among mankind and among livestock, will belong to you. But you shall surely redeem the firstborn of mankind, and you shall redeem the firstborn of the unclean livestock.
\v 16 And his redeemed ones from a son of a month you shall redeem by your valuation, five silver shekels by the shekel of the holy place (it is 20 gerahs).
\v 17 But the firstborn of a cow or the firstborn of a sheep or the firstborn of a goat you shall not redeem; they are holy. You shall throw their blood on the altar, and you shall make their fat smoke as an offering made by fire for an aroma of soothing for Yahweh.
\v 18 And their flesh will belong to you; like the breast of the wave offering or like the right thigh, it will belong to you.

\v 19 All the contributions of the holy things which the sons of Israel lift up to Yahweh, I have given to you and to your sons and to your daughters with you for a statute of eternity. It is an eternal covenant of salt before the face of Yahweh for you and for your seed with you.”
\v 20 And Yahweh said to Aaron, “You shall not inherit in their land and a portion in their midst shall not belong to you. I am your portion and your inheritance in the midst of the sons of Israel.

\p
\v 21 And to the sons of Levi, behold, I have given every tenth in Israel for an inheritance in exchange for their service which they are serving, the service of the tent of meeting.
\v 22 And the sons of Israel shall not again come near to the tent of meeting to bear sin to die.
\v 23 And the Levite, he shall serve the service of the tent of meeting, and they shall bear their iniquity. It is a statute of eternity for your generations, and in the midst of the sons of Israel you shall not inherit an inheritance.
\v 24 For I have given to the Levites for an inheritance the tenth of the sons of Israel which they lift up to Yahweh as a contribution. Therefore, I have said to them, ‘You shall not inherit an inheritance in the midst of the sons of Israel.’”

\p
\v 25 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 26 “And speak to the Levites and say to them, ‘When you take from with the sons of Israel the tenth that I have given to you from with them as your inheritance, then you shall lift up from it a contribution of Yahweh, a tenth from the tenth.
\v 27 And it shall be reckoned to you as your contribution like the grain from the threshing floor and like the fullness from the winepress.
\v 28 Thus you shall lift up, also you, the contribution of Yahweh from all your tenths which you took from with the sons of Israel, and you shall give from it the contribution of Yahweh to Aaron the priest.
\v 29 From all your gifts you shall lift up all of the contribution of Yahweh, from all its fat, its holy part from it.’

\v 30 And you shall say to them, ‘When you lift up its fat from it, then it shall be reckoned to the Levites like the product of the threshing floor and like the product of the winepress.
\v 31 And you shall eat it in every place, you and your house, because it is a wage for you in exchange for your service in the tent of meeting.
\v 32 And you shall not bear sin on account of it when you lift up its fat from it, and the holy things of the sons of Israel you shall not defile, and not die.’”



\c 19
\p
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,
\v 2 “This is the statute of the law which Yahweh has commanded, saying, ‘Speak to the sons of Israel and they shall bring to you an unblemished red heifer in which there is no defect, on which a yoke has not gone up.

\v 3 And you shall give it to Eleazar the priest. And he shall bring it out to the outside of the camp and shall slaughter it before his face.
\v 4 And Eleazar the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger and shall sprinkle some of its blood to opposite the face of the tent of meeting seven times.
\v 5 And he shall burn the heifer before his eyes. He shall burn its skin and its flesh, and its blood with its dung.
\v 6 And the priest shall take wood of cedar and hyssop and scarlet material of a worm, and throw into the midst of the burning of the heifer.

\v 7 And the priest shall wash his garments and bathe his flesh in the water, and afterward he shall enter into the camp, and the priest shall be unclean until the evening.
\v 8 And the one who burned it shall wash his garments in the water and bathe his flesh in the water, and he shall be unclean until the evening.
\v 9 And a clean man shall gather the ashes of the heifer and rest them in a clean place outside of the camp, and it shall be for the congregation of the sons of Israel to keep for the water of purification; it is a sin offering.
\v 10 And the one who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his garments and be unclean until the evening. And it shall be for the sons of Israel and for the sojourner who sojourns in their midst for a statute of eternity.
\p
\v 11 The one who touches a dead body of any human life will be unclean seven days.
\v 12 He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the seventh day he will be clean, and if he does not purify himself on the third day, then on the seventh day he will not be clean.
\v 13 Every one who touches a dead body, a human person who has died, and does not purify himself, makes the Dwelling of Yahweh unclean, and that person shall be cut off from Israel. Because the water of purification was not sprinkled on him, he will be unclean; his uncleanness is still on him.
\p
\v 14 This is the law of a man who dies in a tent: Every one who enters into the tent and everyone who is in the tent will be unclean seven days,
\v 15 and every opened vessel on which there is no fastened cover, it is unclean.
\v 16 And all who touch one pierced of the sword or a dead body or a bone of a human or a grave on the face of the field will be unclean seven days.
\v 17 And they shall take for the unclean one some of the ashes of the burning of the sin offering, and he shall put living water with it into a vessel,
\v 18 and a clean man shall take and dip hyssop in the water. And he shall sprinkle on the tent and on all the vessels and on the lives who were there and on the one who touched the bone or the pierced one or the dead body or the grave,
\v 19 and the clean one shall sprinkle on the unclean one on the third day and on the seventh day, and he shall purify him on the seventh day. And he shall wash his garments and bathe in the water, and he will be unclean until the evening.
\p
\v 20 And a man who is unclean and does not purify himself, that person shall be cut off from the midst of the assembly because he has made the holy place of Yahweh unclean. He has not thrown on himself the water of purification. He is unclean.
\v 21 And it shall be for them for a statute of eternity, and the one who sprinkles the water of purification shall wash his garments, and the one who touches the water of purification will be unclean until the evening,
\v 22 and all who touch him, the unclean one, will be unclean; and the person who touches will be unclean until the evening.”



\c 20
\p
\v 1 And the sons of Israel, all the congregation, entered the wilderness of Zin in the first month, and the people stayed at Kadesh, and Miriam died there and was buried there.
\p
\v 2 And there was no water for the congregation, and they assembled against Moses and against Aaron.
\v 3 And the people quarreled with Moses, and spoke, saying, “If only we had expired when our brothers expired before the face of Yahweh!

\v 4 And why have you brought the assembly of Yahweh into this wilderness to die here, we and our livestock?
\v 5 And why did you bring us up from Egypt to bring us into this evil place? It is not a place of seed or fig free or vine or pomegranate tree, and there is no water to drink!”

\v 6 And Moses and Aaron went from the face of the assembly to the opening of the tent of meeting, and they fell on their faces and the glory of Yahweh appeared to them.
\v 7 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 8 “Take the staff and assemble the congregation, you and Aaron your brother, and you shall speak to the rock before their eyes, and it will give its water; and you shall bring out water to them from the rock, and you shall have the congregation and their livestock drink.”
\v 9 And Moses took the staff from before the face of Yahweh, just as he had commanded him.

\p
\v 10 And Moses and Aaron assembled the assembly at the face of the rock, and he said to them, “Listen now, the rebellious ones, shall we bring out from this rock water for you?”
\v 11 And Moses lifted up his hand and struck the rock with his staff twice, and abundant water came out, and the congregation and their livestock drank.
\v 12 And Yahweh said to Moses and to Aaron, “Because you did not trust in me to regard me as holy before the eyes of the sons of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land that I have given to them.”
\v 13 These are the waters of Meribah, where the sons of Israel quarreled with Yahweh, and he showed himself holy among them.
\p
\v 14 And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, “Thus says your brother Israel: you yourself know all the hardship that we found,
\v 15 and our fathers went down to Egypt, and we dwelled in Egypt many days, and the Egyptians did evil to us and to our fathers.
\v 16 And we cried out to Yahweh, and he heard our voice and sent a messenger and brought us out from Egypt; and behold, we are in Kadesh, the city of the end of your border.
\v 17 Please let us pass through your land. We will not pass through field or vineyard, and will we not drink the water of a well. We will go on the road of the king. We will not turn right or left until we have passed through your border.”

\v 18 And Edom said to him, “You may not pass through me, lest I go out to meet you with the sword.”
\v 19 And the sons of Israel said to him, “We will go on the highway. And if we drink your water, me or my livestock, then we will give their value. Only, there is no matter, let me pass through with my feet.”

\v 20 And he said, “You may not pass through.” And Edom came out to meet him with a heavy people and a strong hand.
\v 21 And Edom refused to give Israel passage through his territory. And Israel turned from near him.

\p
\v 22 And the sons of Israel, all the congregation, set out from Kadesh and came to Mount Hor.
\v 23 And Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron at Mount Hor, near the border of the land of Edom, saying,
\v 24 “Aaron will be gathered to his people, because he will not enter into the land that I have given to the sons of Israel, because you rebelled against my mouth before the waters of Meribah.

\v 25 Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up Mount Hor,
\v 26 and strip Aaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar his son, and Aaron shall be gathered and die there.”

\v 27 And Moses did just as Yahweh had commanded; and they went up to Mount Hor before the eyes of all the congregation,
\v 28 and Moses stripped Aaron of his garments and put them on Eleazar his son, and Aaron died there on the head of the mountain, and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.
\v 29 And all the congregation saw that Aaron had expired, and all the house of Israel bewailed Aaron 30 days.


\c 21
\p
\v 1 And the Canaanite king of Arad, who dwelled in the Negev, heard that Israel had come by the road of the Atharim, and he fought against Israel and took captive some of them as captives.
\v 2 And Israel vowed a vow to Yahweh and said, “If you surely give this people into my hand, then I will dedicate their cities by ban.”
\v 3 And Yahweh listened to the voice of Israel and gave the Canaanites, and he dedicated them and their cities by ban, and he called the name of the place Hormah.
\p
\v 4 And they set out from Mount Hor by the road of the Sea of Reeds to go around the land of Edom. And the soul of the people was short on the road,
\v 5 and the people spoke against God and against Moses: “Why did you bring us up from Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no bread, and there is no water, and our soul detests the worthless bread.”

\v 6 And Yahweh sent snakes, fiery ones, among the people and they bit the people, and many people from Israel died.
\v 7 And the people came to Moses and said, “We have sinned because we have spoken against Yahweh and against you. Pray to Yahweh and may he remove from on us the snake,” and Moses prayed on behalf of the people.

\v 8 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Make for yourself a snake and set it on a pole, and it will happen that any of the bitten will see it and live.”
\v 9 And Moses made a snake of bronze, and he set it on the pole. And it happened that if the snake bit a man, then he looked to the snake of bronze, and he lived.
\p
\v 10 And the sons of Israel set out and camped at Oboth.
\v 11 And they set out from Oboth and camped at Iye Abarim in the wilderness that is on the face of Moab from the rising of the sun.

\v 12 From there they set out and camped at the wadi of Zered.
\v 13 From there they set out and camped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness that goes out from the border of the Amorite, because the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorite.

\v 14 Therefore, it says in the book of the Wars of Yahweh,
\q “… Waheb in Suphah, and the wadis of the Arnon,
\q 
\v 15 and the slope of the wadis that spreads out to the dwelling of Ar and it leans to the border of Moab,”

\p
\v 16 and from there to Beer. It is the well where Yahweh said to Moses, “Gather the people, and I will give water to them.”

\p
\v 17 Then Israel sang this song:
\q “Rise up, well!
\q Sing for it,
\q 
\v 18 the well leaders dug,
\q the noblemen of the people dug it,
\q with a decreer’s staff and their staffs.”
\m And from the wilderness to Mattanah

\v 19 and from Mattanah to Nahaliel and from Nahaliel to Bamoth
\v 20 and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab, the head of the Pisgah, and is looking down on the face of the wasteland.

\p
\v 21 And Israel sent messengers to Sihon the king of the Amorite, saying,
\v 22 “Let us pass through your land. We will not turn into a field or into a vineyard. We will not drink the water of a well. We will go by the road of the king until we have passed through your border.”
\v 23 And Sihon did not give Israel passage through his boundary, and Sihon gathered all his people and went out to the wilderness to meet Israel, and he came to Jahaz and fought with Israel.

\v 24 And Israel struck him by the mouth of the sword and took possession of his land from the Arnon as far as the Jabbok, as far as the sons of Ammon, because the border of the sons of Ammon was fortified.
\v 25 And Israel took all these cities, and Israel dwelled in all the cities of the Amorite in Heshbon and in all its daughters.
\v 26 For Heshbon, it was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorite, and he had fought with the previous king of Moab and had taken all his land from his hand as far as the Arnon.
\v 27 Therefore the speakers of proverbs say,
\q “Come to Heshbon.
\q Let the city of Sihon be built and established.
\q 
\v 28 For fire went out from Heshbon,
\q a flame from the city of Sihon.
\q It ate Ar of Moab,
\q the lords of the high places of Arnon.

\q 
\v 29 Woe to you, Moab!
\q You have perished, people of Chemosh.
\q He has given his sons to be escapees
\q and his daughters into the captivity
\q of Sihon the king of the Amorites.
\q 
\v 30 And we have shot them. Heshbon has perished as far as Dibon.
\q And we have made devastation as far as Nophah,
\q which is as far as Medeba.”

\p
\v 31 And Israel dwelled in the land of the Amorites,
\v 32 and Moses sent to spy out Jazer, and they captured her daughters, and they dispossessed the Amorites who were there.

\p
\v 33 And they turned and went up the road of the Bashan. And Og the king of the Bashan went out to meet them, he and all his people, to the battle at Edrei.
\v 34 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Do not fear him, because I have given into your hand him and all his people and his land, and you shall do to him just as you did to Sihon the king of the Amorite, who dwelled in Heshbon.”
\v 35 And they struck him and his sons and all his people until they had left no survivor for him, and they took possession of his land.



\c 22
\nb
\v 1 And the sons of Israel set out and camped in the plains of Moab, from the other side of the Jordan at Jericho.
\p
\v 2 And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorite.
\v 3 And Moab was extremely terrified because of the face of the people, because they were numerous. And Moab was sick with terror because of the face of the sons of Israel,
\v 4 and Moab said to the elders of Midian, “Now the assembly will lick up all that is around us like an ox licks up the green of the field.” And Balak the son of Zippor was the king of Moab at that time,
\v 5 and he sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor at Pethor, which is near the River, the land of the sons of his people, to summon him, saying, “Behold, a people went out from Egypt. Behold, he has covered the eye of the land, and he is dwelling opposite me.
\v 6 And now please go curse this people for me because they are more numerous than I. Perhaps I will be able to strike them and drive them out from the land. For I know whom you bless will be blessed, and whom you curse will be cursed.”

\p
\v 7 And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian went, and divination fees were in their hand, and they came to Balaam and spoke to him the words of Balak.
\v 8 And he said to them, “Lodge here tonight, and I will bring you back a word, just as Yahweh speaks to me,” and the leaders of Moab stayed with Balaam.

\v 9 And God came to Balaam and said, “Who are these men with you?”
\v 10 And Balaam said to God, “Balak the son of Zippor, the king of Moab, has sent to me.
\v 11 ‘Behold, the people who have come out from Egypt and have covered the eye of the land! Now go curse them for me. Perhaps I will be able to fight them and drive them out.’”

\v 12 And God said to Balaam, “You shall not go with them. You shall not curse the people, because they are blessed.”
\v 13 And Balaam rose in the morning and said to the leaders of Balak, “Go to your land, because Yahweh has refused to grant me to go with you.”
\v 14 And the leaders of Moab rose and came to Balak, and they said, “Balaam refused to come with us.”

\p
\v 15 And Balak added again and sent many leaders, and they were more honored than these.
\v 16 And they came to Balaam and said to him, “Thus says Balak the son of Zippor, ‘Please do not refrain from coming to me,
\v 17 for I will very greatly honor you, and I will do all that you say to me. And please go curse this people for me.’”

\v 18 And Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, “If Balak gives to me his house full of silver and gold, I will not be able to go beyond the mouth of Yahweh my God to do small or big.
\v 19 And now, you also please stay in this place tonight; and may I know what Yahweh will add to speak with me.”
\v 20 And God came to Balaam at night and said to him, “If the men have come to summon you, rise and go with them, and only the word that I speak to you, it you shall do.”

\p
\v 21 And Balaam rose in the morning and saddled his female donkey and went with the leaders of Moab.
\v 22 And the nose of God burned because he was going; and the angel of Yahweh stationed himself in the road as an adversary to him, and he was riding on his female donkey, and two of his servants were with him.
\v 23 And the female donkey saw the angel of Yahweh stationed in the road, and his drawn sword was in his hand, and the female donkey turned aside from the road and went in the field. And Balaam struck the female donkey to turn her to the road.
\v 24 And the angel of Yahweh stood in the narrow pass of the vineyards, a wall on this side and a wall on that side.
\v 25 And the female donkey saw the angel of Yahweh, and she pressed herself to the wall, and she pressed the foot of Balaam to the wall. And he struck her again.
\v 26 And the angel of Yahweh passed on again and stood in a narrow place where there was no road to turn right or left.
\v 27 And the female donkey saw the angel of Yahweh and lay down under Balaam, and the nose of Balaam burned, and he struck the female donkey with the staff.
\v 28 And Yahweh opened the mouth of the female donkey, and she said to Balaam, “What have I done to you that you struck me these three times?”
\v 29 And Balaam said to the female donkey, “Because you acted mockingly with me! If only there was a sword in my hand! Surely I would slay you!”
\v 30 And the female donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your female donkey on which you have ridden from your continuance until this day? Have I ever been accustomed to doing thus to you?” And he said, “No.”

\p
\v 31 And Yahweh uncovered the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of Yahweh stationed in the road and his drawn sword in his hand. And he bowed and bowed down his nose.
\v 32 And the angel of Yahweh said to him, “On account of what have you struck your female donkey these three times? Behold, I myself have gone out as an adversary because your way has been perverse in front of me.
\v 33 And the female donkey saw me and turned aside before my face these three times. If she had not turned aside from me, surely now even you I would have slain and kept her alive.”

\v 34 And Balaam said to the angel of Yahweh, “I have sinned, for I did not know that you were stationed to meet me in the road. And now, if it is evil in your eyes, I will return to me.”
\v 35 And the angel of Yahweh said to Balaam, “Go with the men, and only the word that I speak to you, it you shall speak.” And Balaam went with the leaders of Balak.

\p
\v 36 And Balak heard that Balaam had come, and he went out to meet him at a city of Moab, that is near the border of the Arnon, which is at the end of the border.
\v 37 And Balak said to Balaam, “Did I not indeed send to you to summon you? Why did you not come to me? Am I truly not able to honor you?”

\v 38 And Balaam said to Balak, “Behold, I have come to you. Am I now at all able to speak anything? The word that God puts in my mouth, it will I speak.”
\v 39 And Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath Huzoth,
\v 40 and Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep and sent to Balaam and to the leaders who were with him.

\p
\v 41 And it happened in the morning that Balak took Balaam and brought him up to the high place of Baal, and from there he saw the edge of the people.



\c 23
\nb
\v 1 And Balaam said to Balak, “Build for me in this place seven altars, and prepare for me in this place seven bulls and seven rams.”
\v 2 And Balak did just as Balaam had said, and Balak and Balaam offered up a bull and a ram on the altar.
\v 3 And Balaam said to Balak, “Station yourself beside your burnt offering, and I will go. Perhaps Yahweh will be met to meet me, and I will declare to you the word of what he shows me.” And he went to a bare high place.

\v 4 And God met with Balaam, and he said to him, “I have arranged seven altars and offered up a bull and a ram on the altar.”
\v 5 And Yahweh put a word in the mouth of Balaam and said, “Return to Balak and speak thus.”
\v 6 And he returned to him, and behold, he was stationed beside his burnt offering, he and all the leaders of Moab.

\v 7 And he lifted up his oracle and said,
\q “Balak has led me from Aram,
\q2 the king of Moab from the mountains of the east.
\q ‘Go curse Jacob for me,
\q2 and go denounce Israel.’
\q 
\v 8 How can I curse? God has not cursed.
\q2 And how can I denounce? Yahweh has not denounced.

\q 
\v 9 For from the head of the rocks I see him.
\q2 And from the hills I look at him.
\q Behold, the people dwells by itself
\q2 and it does not reckon itself among the nations.

\q 
\v 10 Who can count the dust of Jacob
\q2 or number the fourth part of Israel?
\q Let my life die the death of the upright ones,
\q2 and let my end be like his!”

\m
\v 11 And Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and behold, you have blessed indeed!”
\v 12 And he answered and said, “Should I not be careful to speak it that Yahweh puts in my mouth?”

\p
\v 13 And Balak said to him, “Please go with me to another place from which you can see him. You will only see his edge, and you will not see all of him, and you will curse him for me from there.”
\v 14 And he took him to the field of Zophim, to the head of the Pisgah, and he built seven altars and offered up a bull and a ram on the altar.
\v 15 Then he said to Balak, “Station yourself here beside your burnt offering, and I will be met with there.”

\v 16 And Yahweh met with Balaam and put a word in his mouth, and he said, “Return to Balak, and thus you shall speak.”
\v 17 And he came to him, and behold, he was stationed beside his altar, and the leaders of Moab were with him; and Balak said to him, “What did Yahweh speak?”
\v 18 And he lifted up his oracle and said,
\q “Rise up, Balak, and listen.
\q2 Give ear to me, son of Zippor.

\q 
\v 19 God is not a man, that he would lie,
\q2 Or a son of mankind, that he would change his mind.
\q Has he said and not done,
\q2 Or spoken and not made it arise? 
\v 20 Behold, I have received to bless.
\q2 And he has blessed, and I cannot turn it back.

\q 
\v 21 He has not looked at hardship in Jacob
\q2 and he has not seen trouble in Israel.
\q Yahweh his God is with him,
\q2 and the shout of the king is with him. 
\v 22 God is bringing them out from Egypt
\q2 like the horns of a wild ox for him.

\q 
\v 23 For there is no omen against Jacob,
\q2 and no divination against Israel.
\q At this time it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel,
\q2 ‘What God has done!’

\q 
\v 24 Look, a people rises like a lioness,
\q2 and like a lion he lifts himself up.
\q He will not lie down until he eats prey
\q2 and drinks the blood of the pierced ones.”

\m
\v 25 And Balak said to Balaam, “Even do not curse him at all! Also, do not bless him at all!”
\v 26 And Balaam answered and said to Balak, “Did I not speak to you, saying, ‘All that Yahweh speaks, it I must do?’”
\v 27 And Balak said to Balaam, “Come now, I will take you to another place. Perhaps it will be right in the eyes of God, and you will curse him for me from there.”

\v 28 And Balak took Balaam to the head of the Peor, looking down on the face of the wasteland.
\v 29 And Balaam said to Balak, “Build for me in this place seven altars and prepare for me in this place seven bulls and seven rams.”
\v 30 And Balak did just as Balaam had said, and he offered up a bull and a ram on the altar.



\c 24
\nb
\v 1 And Balaam saw that it was good in the eyes of Yahweh to bless Israel, and he did not go as time by time to meet omens, and he set his face to the wilderness.

\v 2 And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel dwelling according to its tribes, and the Spirit of God was on him.
\v 3 And he lifted up his discourse and said,
\q “The declaration of Balaam the son of Beor,
\q2 and the declaration of the man opened of eye,

\q 
\v 4 the declaration of the hearer of the words of God,
\q2 who sees the vision of the Almighty,
\q falling down and opened of eyes:
\q 
\v 5 How good are your tents, Jacob,
\q2 your dwellings, Israel!

\q 
\v 6 Like wadis they spread out,
\q2 like gardens beside a river,
\q2 like aloes Yahweh has planted,
\q2 like cedars beside water.

\q 
\v 7 Water will flow from his buckets,
\q2 and his seed with much water.
\q And his king will be higher than Agag,
\q2 and his kingdom will lift itself up.

\q 
\v 8 God is bringing him out from Egypt,
\q like the horns of a wild ox for him.
\q2 He will eat the nations, his enemies.
\q2 And he will break their bones.
\q2 And he will strike his arrows.

\q 
\v 9 He crouched, he lay down like a lion,
\q2 and like a lioness. Who will get him up?
\q Those who bless you are blessed;
\q2 and those who curse you are cursed.”

\p
\v 10 And the nose of Balak burned toward Balaam and he struck his palms, and Balak said to Balaam, “I called you to curse my enemies, and behold, you have repeatedly blessed these three times!
\v 11 And now, flee for yourself to your place. I said I would honor you greatly, and behold, Yahweh has held you back from honor.”

\v 12 And Balaam said to Balak, “Did I not also speak to the messengers that you sent to me, saying.
\v 13 ‘If Balak gives to me his house full of silver and gold, I will not be able to go beyond the mouth of Yahweh to do good or evil from my heart; what Yahweh speaks, it I must speak?’
\v 14 And now, behold I am about to go to my people. Come, I will advise you what this people will do to your people in the future days.”

\v 15 And he lifted up his discourse and said,
\q “The declaration of Balaam the son of Beor,
\q2 and the declaration of the man opened of eye,
\q 
\v 16 the declaration of the hearer of the words of God,
\q2 and the knower of the knowledge of the Most High,
\q2 he sees the vision of the Almighty,
\q falling down and opened of eyes:

\q 
\v 17 I will see him, but not now;
\q I will look at him, but not near.
\q A star has marched from Jacob,
\q2 and a rod has risen from Israel,
\q and he will strike the sides of Moab
\q2 and destroy all the sons of Seth.

\q 
\v 18 And Edom will become a possession,
\q and Seir will become a possession,
\q2 his enemies.
\q2 And Israel will act strongly.
\q 
\v 19 And he will rule from Jacob,
\q2 and he will destroy the survivor from a city.”

\m
\v 20 And he saw Amalek and lifted up his discourse and said,
\q “The first of the nations is Amalek,
\q2 and his end will be up to destruction.”

\m
\v 21 And he saw the Kenite, and he lifted up his discourse and said,
\q “Your dwelling is permanent,
\q2 and your nest is set in the cliff.
\q 
\v 22 But the Kenite will be for burning.
\q2 Until when will Assyria take you captive?”

\m
\v 23 And he lifted up his discourse and said,
\q “Woe! Who can live apart from God establishing him?
\q 
\v 24 And ships will be from the hand of Kittim,
\q2 and they will afflict Asshur and will afflict Eber,
\q2 and he, too, will be up to destruction.”

\m
\v 25 And Balaam got up and went and returned to his place, and Balak also went on his way.



\c 25
\p
\v 1 And Israel dwelled in Shittim, and the people began to prostitute themselves with the daughters of Moab,
\v 2 and they called the people to the sacrifices of their gods, and the people ate, and they worshipped their gods.
\v 3 And Israel bound himself to Baal of Peor. And the nose of Yahweh burned against Israel.

\v 4 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Take all the heads of the people and hang them up before Yahweh in front of the sun, and the burning of the nose of Yahweh may turn back from Israel.”
\v 5 And Moses said to the judges of Israel, “Slay a man his men, the ones who bound themselves to Baal of Peor.”

\p
\v 6 And behold, a man from the sons of Israel came and brought near to his brothers the Midianite woman, before the eyes of Moses and before the eyes of all the congregation of the sons of Israel. And they were weeping at the opening of the tent of meeting.
\v 7 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw and rose up from the midst of the congregation, and took a spear in his hand.

\v 8 And he came after the man of Israel into the domed tent, and he pierced the two of them, the man of Israel and the woman in her stomach. And the plague was stopped from on the sons of Israel.
\v 9 And the ones who died by the plague were 24, 000.

\p
\v 10 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 11 “Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned my heat from on the sons of Israel by his being zealous with my zeal in the midst of them. And I will not make an end of the sons of Israel in my zeal.

\v 12 Therefore say, ‘Behold, I am giving to him my covenant of peace.
\v 13 And it will be a covenant of a priesthood of eternity for him and for his seed after him, because he was zealous for his God and he made atonement for the sons of Israel.’”

\p
\v 14 And the name of the man of Israel, the struck down one who was struck down with the Midianite woman, was Zimri the son of Salu, the leader of a house of a father of the Simeonites.
\v 15 And the name of the woman, the struck down Midanite woman, was Kozbi the daughter of Zur, who was the head of a tribe of a house of a father in Midian.

\p
\v 16 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 17 “Vex the Midianites and you shall strike them down.
\v 18 For they were vexing you by their deceitfulness when they deceived you over the matter of Peor and over the matter of Kozbi the daughter of the leader of Midian, their sister, the one struck down on the plague day over the matter of Peor.”



\c 26
\p
\v 1 And it happened after the plague that Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying,
\v 2 “Lift up the heads of all the congregation of the sons of Israel from a son of 20 years and upward according to the house of their fathers, all who go out to war in Israel.”

\v 3 And Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with them in the plains of Moab beside the Jordan at Jericho, saying,
\v 4 “From a son of 20 years and upward, just as Yahweh commanded Moses and the sons of Israel, the ones who came out from the land of Egypt.”

\p
\v 5 Reuben was the firstborn of Israel. The sons of Reuben: Hanok, the clan of the Hanokite; of Pallu, the clan of the Palluite;

\p
\v 52 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 53 “The land shall be apportioned to these ones as an inheritance by the number of the names.

\v 54 To the numerous you shall increase his inheritance, and to the small you shall lessen his inheritance. His inheritance shall be given, a man according to the mouth of his counted ones.
\v 55 Surely the land shall be apportioned by lots. They shall inherit according to the names of the tribes of their fathers.
\v 56 His inheritance shall be apportioned in accordance with the mouth of the lot, between the numerous and the small.”
\p
\v 57 And these were the counted ones of the Levite according to their clans:

\v 64 And among these there was not a man from the counted ones of Moses and Aaron the priest when they counted the sons of Israel in the wilderness of Sinai.

\v 65 For Yahweh had said to them, “You shall surely die in the wilderness and a man shall not remain from them, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun.”



\c 27
\p
\v 1 And the daughters of Zelophehad the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir the son of Manasseh, of the clans of Manasseh the son of Joseph came near. And these were the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah and Hoglah and Milkah and Tirzah.

\v 2 And they stood before the face of Moses and before the face of Eleazar the priest and before the face of the leaders and all the congregation at the opening of the tent of meeting, saying,
\v 3 “Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the midst of the congregation who assembled against Yahweh with the congregation of Korah, but he died in his sin, and there were no sons for him.

\v 4 Why should the name of our father be withdrawn from the midst of his clan because there is no son for him? Give to us a possession in the midst of the brothers of our father.”
\v 5 And Moses brought near their case before the face of Yahweh.

\p
\v 6 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 7 “The daughters of Zelophehad are speaking rightly. You shall certainly give to them the possession of an inheritance in the midst of the brothers of their father, and you shall cause the inheritance of their father to pass over to them.
\v 8 And you shall speak to the sons of Israel, saying, ‘If a man dies and there is no son for him, then you shall cause his inheritance to pass over to his daughter.

\v 9 And if there is no daughter for him, then you shall give his inheritance to his brothers.
\v 10 And if there are no brothers for him, then you shall give his inheritance to the brothers of his father.
\v 11 And if there are no brothers for his father, then you shall give his inheritance to his blood-relative, the nearest to him from his clan, and he shall take possession of it. And it shall be for the sons of Israel as a statute of judgment, just as Yahweh has commanded Moses.’”

\p
\v 12 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Go up to this mountain of Abarim, and see the land that I have given to the sons of Israel.
\v 13 And you shall see it and be gathered to your people, also you, just as Aaron your brother was gathered,
\v 14 because in the wilderness of Zin, in the quarrel of the congregation, you rebelled against my mouth to regard me as holy at the waters before their eyes.” These are the waters of Meribah Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.

\p
\v 15 And Moses spoke to Yahweh, saying,
\v 16 “May Yahweh, the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the congregation
\v 17 who will go out before the face of them and who will come before the face of them, and who will take them out and who will bring them in, and the congregation of Yahweh will not be like sheep that have no shepherd for them.”

\v 18 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Take for yourself Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is a spirit, and lay your hand on him.
\v 19 And you shall stand him before the face of Eleazar the priest and before the face of all the congregation, and you shall command him before their eyes.

\v 20 And you shall give some of your authority on him, so that all the congregation of the sons of Israel will hear.
\v 21 And he shall stand before the face of Eleazar the priest, and he shall ask for him by the judgment of the Urim before the face of Yahweh. In accordance with his mouth he shall go out and in accordance with his mouth he shall come in, he and all the sons of Israel with him and all the congregation.”

\v 22 And Moses did just as Yahweh had commanded him, and he took Joshua and stood him before the face of Eleazar the priest and before the face of all the congregation,
\v 23 and he laid his hands on him, and he commanded him, just as Yahweh had spoken by the hand of Moses.



\c 28
\p
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 2 “Command the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘You shall be careful to offer to me at its appointed time my offering, my food for my offerings made by fire, an aroma of my soothing.’

\v 3 And you shall say to them, ‘This is the offering made by fire that you shall offer to Yahweh: unblemished male lambs, sons of a year, two for the day, a burnt offering continually.
\v 4 One male lamb you shall do in the morning, and the second male lamb you shall do between the evenings,
\v 5 and the tenth of an ephah of fine flour for a grain offering, mixed with the fourth of a hin of beaten oil.

\v 6 It is a burnt offering of continuity, the one done at Mount Sinai for an aroma of soothing, an offering made by fire to Yahweh.
\v 7 And its drink offering shall be the fourth of a hin for one male lamb. You shall pour out in the holy place a drink offering of intoxicating drink to Yahweh.
\v 8 And you shall do the second male lamb between the evenings. You shall do like the grain offering of the morning and its drink offering, an offering made by fire, an aroma of soothing to Yahweh.

\p
\v 9 And on the Sabbath day: two unblemished male lambs, sons of a year, and two-tenths fine flour as a grain offering mixed with the oil, and its drink offering
\v 10 {are} the burnt offering of the Sabbath by its Sabbath, in addition to the burnt offering of the continuity and its drink offering.

\p
\v 11 And at the heads of your months, you shall offer a burnt offering to Yahweh: two bulls, sons of cattle, and one ram, seven male lambs, sons of a year, unblemished;
\v 12 and three-tenths fine flour as a grain offering mixed with the oil for one bull, and two-tenths fine flour as a grain offering mixed with the oil for the one ram,
\v 13 and a tenth, a tenth fine flour as a grain offering mixed with the oil for one male lamb. It is a burnt offering, an aroma of soothing, an offering made by fire to Yahweh.

\v 14 And their drink offerings shall be half of a hin of wine for the bull and a third of a hin for the ram and a fourth of a hin for the male lamb. This shall be the burnt offering of the month by its month for the months of the year.
\v 15 And one buck of the goats shall be done as a sin offering to Yahweh in addition to the burnt offering of the continuity and its drink offering.

\p
\v 16 And in the first month, on day 14 of the month is the Passover of Yahweh.
\v 17 And on day 15 of this month shall be a feast. Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread.
\v 18 On the first day shall be a convocation of holiness. You shall not do any work of labor,

\v 19 and you shall offer an offering made by fire, a burnt offering to Yahweh: two bulls, sons of cattle, and one ram, and seven male lambs, sons of a year. They shall be unblemished for you.
\v 20 And their grain offering: you shall do fine flour mixed with the oil, three-tenths for the bull and two-tenths for the ram.
\v 21 A tenth, a tenth you shall do for one male lamb of the seven male lambs,
\v 22 and one male goat as the sin offering to make atonement for yourselves.

\v 39 You shall do these for Yahweh at your appointed times, apart from your vows and your voluntary offerings, for your burnt offerings, and for your grain offerings, and for your drink offerings, and for your peace offerings.”
\v 40 And Moses spoke to the sons of Israel according to all that Yahweh had commanded Moses.



\c 30
\p
\v 1 And Moses spoke to the heads of the tribes of the sons of Israel, saying, “This is the word that Yahweh has commanded:
\v 2 When a man vows a vow to Yahweh or swears an oath to bind a binding vow on his life, he shall not profane his word. He shall do according to all that came out from his mouth.

\v 3 And if a woman vows a vow to Yahweh and binds a binding vow in the house of her father, in her youth,
\v 4 and her father hears her vow and her binding vow that she bound on her life, and her father is silent to her, then all her vows shall stand, and every binding vow that she has bound on her life shall stand.

\v 5 And if her father forbids her on the day of his hearing, any of her vows and her binding vows that she bound on her life shall not stand, and Yahweh will forgive her, because her father forbade her.

\v 6 And if she ever belongs to a man, and her vows are on her, or thoughtless speech of her lips that she has bound is on her life,
\v 7 and her husband hears on the day of his hearing and is silent to her, then her vows shall stand, and her binding vows that she bound on her life shall stand.

\v 8 And if her husband forbids her on the day of his hearing, then he breaks her vow which is on her and the thoughtless speech of her lips that she bound on her life, and Yahweh will forgive her.

\v 9 And the vow of a widow and a driven out woman, all that she binds on her life shall stand on her.
\v 10 And if she vowed or bound a binding vow on her life by an oath in the house of her husband,
\v 11 and her husband hears and is silent to her, he does not forbid her, then all her vows shall stand, and every binding vow that she bound on her life shall stand.

\v 12 And if her husband ever breaks them on the day of his hearing, all that went out of her lips for her vows and for the binding vow of her life shall not stand. Her husband has broken them, and Yahweh will forgive her.

\v 13 Every vow and every oath of a binding vow to afflict her life, her husband may make it stand, and her husband may break it.
\v 14 And if her husband is wholly silent to her from day to day, then he will make all her vows or all her binding vows which are on her stand. He made them stand because he was silent to her on the day of his hearing.

\v 15 And if he ever breaks them after his hearing, then he will bear her iniquity.”
\v 16 These are the statutes that Yahweh commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, between a father and his daughter in her youth in the house of her father.



\c 31
\p
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 2 “Take vengeance, the vengeance of the sons of Israel, from with the Midianites. Afterward you shall be gathered to your people.”

\v 3 And Moses spoke to the people, saying, “Equip yourselves, some of the men with you, for the war. And they will be against Midian to give the vengeance of Yahweh on Midian.
\v 4 You shall send to the war for all the tribes of Israel, a thousand for a tribe, a thousand for a tribe.”
\v 5 And a thousand for a tribe were provided from the thousands of Israel, 12, 000 equipped for battle.

\v 6 And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand for a tribe, them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest to the war. And the vessels of holiness and the blasting trumpets were in his hand.
\v 7 And they waged war against Midian, just as Yahweh had commanded Moses, and they slew every male.
\v 8 And they slew the kings of Midian with their pierced ones: Evi and Rekem and Zur and Hur and Reba, the five kings of Midian; and they slew Balaam the son of Beor by the sword.

\v 9 And the sons of Israel took captive the women of Midian and their children, and they plundered all their animals and all their livestock and all their wealth.
\v 10 And they burned with the fire all their cities with their dwellings and all their encampments.

\v 11 And they took all the spoil and all the booty of human and of animal.
\v 12 And they brought to Moses and to Eleazar the priest and to the congregation of the sons of Israel, the captives and the booty and the spoil to the camp at the plains of Moab, which are beside the Jordan at Jericho.
\p
\v 13 And Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the leaders of the congregation went out to meet them at the outside of the camp.
\v 14 And Moses was furious with the appointed ones of the army, the leaders of the thousands and the leaders of the hundreds, the ones coming from the battle of the war.
\v 15 And Moses said to them, “Have you let every woman live?

\v 16 Look, these were by the word of Balaam for the sons of Israel to commit unfaithfulness against Yahweh concerning the matter of Peor, and the plague was among the congregation of Yahweh.
\v 17 And now, slay every male among the children and slay every woman who has known a man by the bed of a male.
\v 18 And keep alive for yourselves every child among the women who has not known the bed of a male.
\v 19 And you, camp outside of the camp seven days, all who have slain a person and all who have touched a pierced one. Purify yourselves on the third day and on the seventh day, you and your captives,
\v 20 and you shall purify every garment and every vessel of skin and every work of goats and every vessel of wood.”

\p
\v 21 And Eleazar the priest said to the men of the army who had gone to the battle, “This is a statute of the law that Yahweh has commanded Moses:
\v 22 Only the gold and the silver, the bronze, the iron, the tin, and the lead,
\v 23 every thing that can come through the fire you shall pass through the fire, and it will become clean. However, it shall be purified with the water of purification, and all that can not come through the fire you shall pass through the water.
\v 24 And you shall wash your garments on the seventh day, and you will be clean, and afterward you may enter into the camp.”

\p
\v 25 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 26 “Lift up the head of the booty of the captives, of human and of animal, you and Eleazar the priest and the heads of the fathers of the congregation.
\v 27 And you shall divide the booty between the wielders of the war who went out to the battle and all the congregation.

\v 28 And you shall raise a tax for Yahweh from with the men of the war who went out to the battle, one life from 500, from human and from cattle and from the donkeys and from the flock.
\v 29 You shall take from half of them and give the contribution of Yahweh to Eleazar the priest.
\v 30 And from the half of the sons of Israel you shall take one taken from the 50, from human, from cattle, from the donkeys and from the flock, from every animal, and you shall give them to the Levites, the keepers of the keeping of the Dwelling of Yahweh.”
\v 31 And Moses and Eleazar the priest did just as Yahweh had commanded Moses.

\p
\v 32 And the booty, the remainder of the plunder that the people of the army plundered, was 675, 000 sheep,
\v 33 and 72, 000 cattle,
\v 34 and 61, 000 donkeys,
\v 35 and human lives, from the women who had not known the bed of a male, every life, 32, 000.

\v 36 And the half of the portion of the ones who went out with the army: the number of the
 sheep was 337, 500.
\v 37 And the tax for Yahweh from the flock was 675.
\v 38 And the cattle were 36, 000 and their tax for Yahweh was 72.

\v 39 And the donkeys were 30, 500, and their tax for Yahweh was 61.
\v 40 And the human lives were 16, 000, and their tax for Yahweh was 32 lives.
\v 41 And Moses gave the tax of the contribution of Yahweh to Eleazar the priest, just as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\p
\v 42 And from the half of the sons of Israel whom Moses had divided from the men who waged war,
\v 43 and the half of the congregation from the flock was 337, 500,
\v 44 and 36, 000 cattle,
\v 45 and 30, 500 donkeys,
\v 46 and 16, 000 human lives.

\v 47 And Moses took from the half of the sons of Israel the taken, one from the 50, from human and from animal, and he gave them to the Levites, the keepers of the keeping of the Dwelling of Yahweh, just as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\p
\v 48 And the appointed ones who were for the thousands of the army, the leaders of the thousands and the leaders of the hundreds, came near to Moses.
\v 49 And they said to Moses, “Your servants have lifted up the heads of the men of the war who were in our hand, and not a man from us is missing.

\v 50 And we have offered the offering of Yahweh, a man what he found of the objects of gold, armlet, and bracelet, signet ring, earring, and ornament, to make atonement for our lives before the face of Yahweh.”
\v 51 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from with them, every object of craft.

\v 52 And all the gold of the contribution which they raised to Yahweh from with the leaders of the thousands and from with the leaders of the hundreds was 16, 750 shekels.
\v 53 The men of the army had plundered, a man for himself.
\v 54 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from with the leaders of the thousands and the hundreds, and they brought it to the tent of meeting, a memorial for the sons of Israel before the face of Yahweh.


\c 32
\p
\v 1 And the livestock of the sons of Reuben and of the sons of Gad was great, very numerous. And they saw the land of Jazer and the land of Gilead, and behold, the place was a place of livestock.
\v 2 And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben came and said to Moses and to Eleazar the priest and to the leaders of the congregation, saying,
\v 3 “Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Sebam, and Nebo, and Beon

\v 4 are the land that Yahweh struck before the face of the congregation of Israel. It is a land of livestock, and livestock belongs to your servants.”
\v 5 And they said, “If we have found favor in your eyes, let this land be given to your servants as a possession. Do not make us cross over the Jordan.”

\p
\v 6 And Moses said to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Reuben, “Will your brothers go to the war and you yourselves will dwell here?
\v 7 And why do you discourage the heart of the sons of Israel from crossing over into the land that Yahweh has given to them?

\v 8 Thus your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to see the land.
\v 9 And they went up as far as the wadi of Eshkol, and they saw the land and discouraged the heart of the sons of Israel to not enter into the land that Yahweh had given to them.

\v 10 And the nose of Yahweh burned on that day, and he swore, saying,
\v 11 ‘If the men who went up from Egypt, from a son of 20 years and upward, will see the ground which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob! For they are not fully after me,
\v 12 except Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua the son of Nun, because they are fully after Yahweh.’

\v 13 And the nose of Yahweh burned against Israel, and he made them wander in the wilderness 40 years until the finishing of all the generation who had done evil in the eyes of Yahweh.
\v 14 And behold, you have risen up in place of your fathers, a brood of sinful men, to add more to the burning of the nose of Yahweh toward Israel.
\v 15 If you turn from after him, then he will yet again leave him in the wilderness, and you will have destroyed all this people.”

\p
\v 16 And they came near to him and said, “Here we will build walls of the flock for our livestock and cities for our children.
\v 17 And we ourselves will be equipped for war, hurrying before the face of the sons of Israel until when we have brought them into their place. And our children will dwell in the cities of the fortification because of the face of those who dwell in the land.

\v 18 We will not return to our houses until the sons of Israel get an inheritance for themselves, a man his inheritance.
\v 19 For we will not inherit with them from across of the Jordan and beyond, because our inheritance came to us from beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise.”

\p
\v 20 And Moses said to them, “If you do this thing, if you equip yourselves before the face of Yahweh for the war,
\v 21 then every man equipped for war shall cross over the Jordan for you before the face of Yahweh, until he has dispossessed his enemy from his face
\v 22 and the land is subdued before the face of Yahweh, then afterward you may return. And you will be free of obligation from Yahweh and from Israel, and this land will be for you for a possession before the face of Yahweh.

\v 23 And if you do not do so, behold, you will have sinned against Yahweh, and know that your sin will find you.
\v 24 Build for yourselves cities for your children and walls for your livestock, and you shall do what has gone out from your mouth.”
\v 25 And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying, “Your servants will do just as my master is commanding.

\v 26 Our children, our wives, our livestock, and all our animals will be there in the cities of the Gilead.
\v 27 And your servants will cross over, every man equipped for war of the army, before the face of Yahweh for the war, just as my master has spoken.”

\p
\v 28 And Moses commanded Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun and the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the sons of Israel concerning them.
\v 29 And Moses said to them, “If the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben cross over the Jordan with you, every man equipped for the war before the face of Yahweh, and the land is subdued before your faces, then you will give to them the land of the Gilead as a possession.
\v 30 And if the men equipped for war do not cross over with you, then they will take possession in your midst in the land of Canaan.”

\v 31 And the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben answered, saying, “What Yahweh has spoken to your servants, so we will do.
\v 32 We will cross over, the men equipped for war, before the face of Yahweh into the land of Canaan. And with us will be the possession of our inheritance from beyond the Jordan.”

\p
\v 33 And Moses gave to them, to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Reuben, and to the half of the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon the king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og the king of the Bashan, the land of its cities with the borders of the cities of the surrounding land.

\v 34 And the sons of Gad built Dibon and Ataroth and Aroer
\v 35 and Atroth Shophan and Jazer and Jogbehah
\v 36 and Beth Nimrah and Beth Haran, the cities of fortification and the walls of the flock.

\v 37 And the sons of Reuben built Heshbon and Elealeh and Kiriathaim
\v 38 and Nebo and Baal Meon (names were changed) and Sibmah. And they called the names of the cities that they built by names.
\v 39 And the sons of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead and captured it and dispossessed the Amorites who were in it.

\v 40 And Moses gave the Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh, and he dwelled in it.
\v 41 And Jair the son of Manasseh went and captured their tent villages, and he called them Havvoth Jair.
\v 42 And Nobah went and captured Kenath and its daughters. And he called it Nobah, by his name.

\p
\v 1 These are the journeys of the sons of Israel who went out from the land of Egypt according to their tribes by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
\v 2 And Moses wrote down their departure points according to their tribes in accordance with the mouth of Yahweh, and these are their journeys according to their departure points.

\v 3 And they set out from Rameses on the first month, on day 15 of the first month, from the day after the Passover the sons of Israel went out with a raised hand before the eyes of all the Egyptians.
\v 4 And the Egyptians were burying those whom Yahweh had struck down, all the firstborn. And Yahweh enacted judgment against their gods.

\v 36 And they set out from Ezion Geber and camped in the wilderness of Zin (it is Kadesh).
\v 37 And they set out from Kadesh and camped at Mount Hor, at the edge of the land of Edom.

\p
\v 38 And Aaron the priest went up to Mount Hor in accordance with the mouth of Yahweh and died there in the fortieth year of the going out of the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt, in the fifth month, on 1 of the month.
\v 39 And Aaron was a son of 123 years when he died at Mount Hor.

\p
\v 40 And the Canaanite, the king of Arad (and he was dwelling in the Negev in the land of Canaan), heard when the sons of Israel came.

\p
\v 41 And they set out from Mount Hor and camped at Zalmonah.
\v 42 And they set out from Zalmonah and camped at Punon.

\v 49 And they camped beside the Jordan, from Beth Jeshimoth to Abel Shittim in the plains of Moab.

\p
\v 50 And Yahweh spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab beside the Jordan at Jericho, saying,
\v 51 “Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘When you cross over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
\v 52 then you shall dispossess all those who dwell in the land from your face, and you shall destroy all their carved figures, and you shall destroy all the figures of their molten metal, and you shall destroy all their high places.

\v 53 And you shall take possession of the land and dwell in it, because I have given the land to you to possess it.
\v 54 And you shall inherit for yourselves the land by lot, according to your clans. You shall increase his inheritance for the numerous, and you shall decrease his inheritance for the few. To there where the lot goes out for him, to him it will belong. According to the tribes of your fathers you shall inherit for yourselves.

\v 55 And if you do not dispossess those who dwell in the land from your face, then whom you leave from them will be as thorns in your eyes and as pricks in your sides, and they shall vex you on the land that you are about to dwell in.
\v 56 And it will happen that I will do to you just as I had intended to do to them.’”



\c 34
\p
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 2 “Command the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘When you enter into the land of Canaan, this is the land that has fallen to you as an inheritance, the land of Canaan and its borders,
\v 3 and the corner of the south will be for you from the wilderness of Zin beside the hands of Edom. And the border of the south will be for you from the end of the Sea of Salt eastward.

\v 4 And the border will turn for you from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim and cross over to Zin, and its outer limits will be from the south to Kadesh Barnea, and it will go out to Hazar Addar and cross over to Azmon.

\p
\v 10 And you shall mark out for you the border to the east from Hazar Enan to Shepham.
\v 11 And the border will go down from Shepham to Riblah, from east of Ain. And the border will go down and strike on the shoulder of the Sea of Kinnereth eastward.
\v 12 And the border will go down to the Jordan and its outer limits will be the Sea of Salt. This will be for you the land according to its borders all around.’”

\p
\v 13 And Moses commanded the sons of Israel, saying, “This is the land, it which you will inherit for yourselves by lot, which Yahweh has commanded to give to the nine tribes and to the half of the tribe.
\v 14 For the tribe of the sons of the Reubenites according to the house of their fathers and the tribe of the sons of the Gadites according to the house of their fathers have taken, and the half of the tribe of Manasseh has taken their inheritance.
\v 15 The two tribes and the half of the tribe have taken their inheritance from beyond the Jordan at Jericho eastward, toward the sunrise.”

\p
\v 16 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 17 “These are the names of the men who will divide the land for you as an inheritance: Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun.
\v 18 And you shall take one leader, one leader from a tribe to divide the land as an inheritance.

\v 19 And these are the names of the men:
\q1 of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh;
\q1 
\v 20 and of the tribe of the sons of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud;

\q1 
\v 21 of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Kislon;
\q1 
\v 22 and of the tribe of the sons of Dan a leader, Bukki the son of Jogli;
\q1 
\v 23 of the sons of Joseph, of the tribe of the sons of Manasseh a leader, Hanniel the son of Ephod;

\q1 
\v 24 and of the tribe of the sons of Ephraim a leader, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan;
\q1 
\v 25 and of the tribe of the sons of Zebulun a leader, Elizaphan the son of Parnak;
\q1 
\v 26 and of the tribe of the sons of Issachar a leader, Paltiel the son of Azzan;

\q1 
\v 27 and of the tribe of the sons of Asher a leader, Ahihud the son of Shelomi;
\q1 
\v 28 and of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali a leader, Pedahel the son of Ammihud.”
\m
\v 29 These are whom Yahweh commanded to divide an inheritance for the sons of Israel in the land of Canaan.

\p
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab beside the Jordan at Jericho, saying,
\v 2 “Command the sons of Israel, and they shall give to the Levites cities for dwelling from the inheritance of their possession, and you shall give to the Levites pastureland for the cities, all around them.
\v 3 And the cities will be for them for dwelling, and their pastureland will be for their livestock and for their property and for all their living things.
\v 4 And the pasturelands of the cities that you shall give to the Levites shall be from the wall of the city and outward 1, 000 cubits all around.

\v 5 And you shall measure 2, 000 by the cubit from outside of the city toward the corner of the east, and 2, 000 by the cubit to the corner of the south, and 2, 000 by the cubit to the corner of the west, and 2, 000 by the cubit to the corner of the north, and the city will be in the middle. This will be the pastureland of the cities for them.

\v 6 And along with the cities which you shall give to the Levites, you shall give six cities of refuge to which the one who kills may flee, and in addition to them you shall give 42 cities.
\v 7 All the cities that you shall give to the Levites shall be 48 cities, them and their pasturelands.

\v 8 And the cities that you shall give from the possession of the sons of Israel, you shall increase from with the numerous, and you shall decrease from with the few. A man shall give from his cities to the Levites according to the mouth of his inheritance that he has inherited.”

\p
\v 9 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 10 “Speak to the sons of Israel and say to them, ‘When you cross over the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
\v 11 then you shall choose for yourselves cities; they will be cities of refuge for you, and the one who kills, the one who struck down a person by mistake, shall flee to there.

\v 12 And the cities will be for you for refuge from the avenger, and the one who kills will not die until he stands before the face of the congregation for the judgment.
\v 13 And the cities that you shall give shall be six cities of refuge for you.
\v 14 You shall give three cities from beyond the Jordan, and you shall give three cities in the land of Canaan. They shall be cities of refuge.
\v 15 For the sons of Israel, and for the sojourner, and for the temporary dweller in your midst, these six cities shall be for refuge to flee to, every one who has struck down a person by mistake.

\p
\v 16 And if he struck him down with an object of iron and he died, he is one who murders. The one who murders shall certainly be put to death.
\v 17 And if he struck him down with a stone in hand by which one could die and he died, he is one who murders. The one who murders shall certainly be put to death.
\v 18 Or if he struck him down with an object of wood in hand by which one could die and he died, he is one who murders. The one who murders shall certainly be put to death.
\v 19 The avenger of blood, he shall put the one who murders to death. When he meets him, he shall put him to death.
\v 20 And if with hatred he pushes him or throws something at him by lying in wait, and he dies,
\v 21 or if with hostility he strikes him down with his hand, and he dies, you shall certainly put to death the one who strikes down; he is one who murders. The avenger of blood shall put to death the one who murders, when he meets him.

\p
\v 22 And if with suddenness without hostility he pushes him or throws any object at him without lying in wait,
\v 23 or if with any stone by which one could die without seeing he drops it on him and he dies and he was not an enemy to him and was not seeking his harm,
\v 24 then the congregation shall judge between the one who struck down and the avenger of blood in accordance with these judgments.
\v 25 And the congregation shall rescue the one who kills from the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall bring him back into the city of his refuge to which he had fled, and he shall dwell in it until the death of the great priest, him whom he anointed with the oil of holiness.
\v 26 And if the one who kills ever goes out of the border of the city of his refuge to which he has fled,
\v 27 and the avenger of blood finds him outside the border of the city of his refuge, and the avenger of blood kills the one who kills, there will be no blood against him.
\v 28 For in the city of his refuge he shall dwell until the death of the great priest, and after the death of the great priest the one who kills may return to the land of his possession.
\p
\v 29 And these shall be for you as a statute of judgment for your generations in all your dwellings.
\v 30 Every one who strikes down a person, according to the mouth of witnesses he shall kill the one who kills. And one witness shall not testify against a person to put to death.
\v 31 And you shall not take a ransom for the life of one who kills, he who is guilty to die, because he shall certainly be put to death.
\v 32 And you shall not take a ransom for the one who flees into the city of his refuge, to return to dwell in the land until the death of the priest.
\v 33 And you shall not pollute the land which you are in because the blood itself pollutes the land. And atonement cannot be made for the land for the blood that is poured out on it except by the blood of the one who poured it out.
\v 34 And you shall not defile the land which you are dwelling in, which I am dwelling in the midst of, because I, Yahweh, am dwelling in the midst of the sons of Israel.’”

\p
\v 1 And the heads of the fathers of the clans of the sons of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, from the clans of the sons of Joseph, came near and spoke before the face of Moses and before the face of the leaders, the heads of the fathers of the sons of Israel.
\v 2 And they said, “Yahweh commanded my master to give the land as an inheritance by lot to the sons of Israel, and my master was commanded by Yahweh to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters.

\v 3 And they will become wives for one from the sons of the tribes of the sons of Israel, and their inheritance will be withdrawn from the inheritance of our fathers, and it will be added onto the inheritance of the tribe that they belong to, and it will be withdrawn from the lot of our inheritance.
\v 4 And when it will be the Jubilee for the sons of Israel, then their inheritance will be added onto the inheritance of the tribe which they belong to, and their inheritance will be withdrawn from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.”

\p
\v 5 And Moses commanded the sons of Israel in accordance with the mouth of Yahweh, saying, “What the tribe of the sons of Joseph is speaking is right.
\v 6 This is the word that Yahweh commands to the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, ‘They may become wives of the good one in their eyes, only they shall become wives of the clan of the tribe of their father.

\v 7 And an inheritance of the sons of Israel shall not go around from tribe to tribe, but a man of the sons of Israel shall cling to the inheritance of the tribe of his father.

\v 8 And every daughter who possesses an inheritance from the tribes of the sons of Israel shall become a wife for one from the clan of the tribe of her father, so that the sons of Israel will have a possession, a man, the inheritance of his fathers.
\v 9 And an inheritance shall not go around from a tribe to another tribe, but each tribe of the sons of Israel shall cling to his inheritance.’”

\p
\v 10 Just as Yahweh commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad.
\v 11 And Mahlah, Tirzah and Hoglah and Milkah and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, became wives for the sons of their uncles.
\v 12 They became wives from the clans of the sons of Manasseh, the son of Joseph, and their inheritance was with the tribe of the clan of their father.

\p
\v 13 These are the commands and the judgments that Yahweh commanded by the hand of Moses to the sons of Israel in the plains of Moab beside the Jordan at Jericho.
