\v 1 The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to him to show to his servants what must happen soon. And he signified, sending through his angel to his servant John,
\v 2 who attested the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ, as much as he saw.
\v 3 Blessed {are} the one reading and the ones hearing the words of this prophecy and keeping the things having been written in it, for the time {is} near.

\p
\v 4 John, to the seven churches in Asia: Grace to you and peace from the one being and the one having been and the one coming and from the seven spirits who {are} before his throne,
\v 5 and from Jesus Christ, “the faithful witness,” “the firstborn” from the dead and “the ruler of the kings of the earth.” To the one loving us and having released us from our sins by his blood
\v 6 and he has made us a kingdom, priests to God and his Father—to him {be} the glory and the power to the ages. Amen.

\q1 
\v 7 “Behold, he is coming with the clouds,”
\q2
and “every eye will see him,
\q1
even those who pierced him,”
\q2
and all the tribes of the earth “will mourn because of him.”
\m
Yes, Amen.
\p
\v 8 “I am the alpha and the omega,” says the Lord God, “the one being and the one having been and the one coming, the Ruler of All.”
\f + \ft Some versions read \fqa I am the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the end, says the Lord God.\fqa*\f*

\p
\v 9 I, John, your brother and partner in the suffering and kingdom and endurance {that are} in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.
\v 10 I was in the Spirit on the Lord’s day, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet,
\v 11 saying, “Write what you see on a scroll and send it to the seven churches—to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea.”

\v 12 And I turned around to see the voice that was speaking with me, and having turned, I saw seven golden lampstands,
\v 13 and in the middle of the lampstands {one} like a son of man, wearing a foot-length robe and a golden sash wrapped around {his} chest.

\v 14 Now his head and hair {were} white as wool—white as snow—and his eyes {were} like a flame of fire,
\v 15 and his feet {were} like bronze as having been refined in a furnace, and his voice {was} like the sound of many waters,
\v 16 and having seven stars in his right hand and a sharp, double-edged sword coming out of his mouth, and his face as the sun shines in its strength.

\v 17 And when I saw him, I fell at his feet like a dead man, but he placed his right hand on me, saying, “Do not be afraid! I am the first and the last
\v 18 and the one living; and I became dead, but behold, I am living to the ages of the ages, and I have the keys of death and of Hades.

\v 19 Therefore, write what you have seen, and what is, and what is about to happen after these things.
\v 20 The mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and the seven golden lampstands: The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.


\c 2
\p
\v 1 To the angel of the church in Ephesus write:
\p ‘The one holding the seven stars in his right hand, the one walking in the midst of the seven golden lampstands, says these things:
\v 2 “I know your works and labor and your endurance and that you can not tolerate evil ones and {that} you have tested the ones calling themselves apostles but are not and you have found them {to be} false

\v 3 and {that} you have endurance and have suffered because of my name and have not grown weary.
\v 4 But I have against you that you have abandoned your first love.
\v 5 Therefore, remember from where you have fallen and repent and do the first works. But if not, I will come to you and I will remove your lampstand from its place—if you do not repent.

\v 6 But you have this, that you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.
\v 7 Let the one having an ear hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches. To the one conquering, I will grant to him to eat from the tree of life that is in the paradise of God.”’

\p
\v 8 And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write:
\p ‘The first and the last, who became dead but lived, says these things:
\v 9 “I know your affliction and poverty—but you are rich—and the slander of the ones saying themselves to be Jews, but they are not, but {are} a synagogue of Satan.

\v 10 Do not fear what you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to throw {some} of you into prison so that you will be tested, and you will have tribulation for ten days. Be faithful until death, and I will give you the crown of life.
\v 11 Let the one having an ear hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches. The one conquering will certainly not be hurt by the second death.”’

\p
\v 12 And to the angel of the church in Pergamum write:
\p ‘The one having the sharp, double-edged sword says these things:
\v 13 “I know where you live, where the throne of Satan {is}, yet you hold my name and you did not deny my faith even in the days of Antipas my witness, my faithful one, who was killed among you, where Satan lives.

\v 14 But I have a few things against you, that you have there ones holding the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to throw a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, to eat idol-offerings and to be sexually immoral.
\v 15 Thus you also have ones holding the teaching of the Nicolaitans similarly.

\v 16 Repent, therefore! But if not, I will come to you quickly and wage war against them with the sword of my mouth.
\v 17 Let the one having an ear hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches. To the one conquering, I will give to him of the hidden manna, and I will give to him a white stone and on the stone a new name written that no one knows except the one receiving it.”’

\p
\v 18 And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write:
\p ‘The Son of God, the one having his eyes like a flame of fire and his feet like bronze, says these things:
\v 19 “I know your works and love and faith and service and your endurance, and your last works {are} greater than the first.

\v 20 But I have against you that you tolerate the woman Jezebel, the one calling herself a prophetess, and she teaches and deceives my servants to be sexually immoral and to eat idol-offerings.
\v 21 And I have given her time so that she might repent, but she is not willing to repent of her immorality.

\v 22 Behold! I will throw her onto a bed, and the ones committing adultery with her into great tribulation, if they do not repent of her deeds.
\v 23 And I will strike her children with death, and all the churches will know that I am the one searching kidneys and hearts, and I will give to each of you according to your deeds.

\v 24 But I say to you, to the rest in Thyatira, to as many as do not hold this teaching, whoever has not known the deep things of Satan, as they call them: ‘I do not put another burden on you,
\v 25 only hold what you have until I come.’

\m
\v 26 And the one conquering and the one keeping my works until the end, to him I will give authority over the nations.
\v 27 ‘And he will rule them with an iron sceptre, as clay jars are shattered,’
\v 28 as I also have received from my Father, and I will give to him the morning star.
\v 29 Let the one having an ear hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches.”’


\c 3
\p
\v 1 And to the angel of the church in Sardis write:
\p ‘The one having the seven spirits of God and the seven stars says these things: “I know your works, that you have a name that you are alive, but you are dead.
\v 2 Becoming waking and strengthen the remainder that is about to die, for I have not found your works completed before my God.

\v 3 Remember, therefore, how you have received and heard, and be keeping and repent. But if you should not be awake, I will come like a thief and you will certainly not know at what hour I will come against you.
\v 4 But you have a few names in Sardis who have not stained their clothes, and they will walk with me in white, for they are worthy.

\v 5 The one conquering will be clothed thus in white garments, and I will certainly not wipe out his name from the Book of Life, but I will confess his name before my Father and before his angels.
\v 6 Let the one having an ear hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches.”’

\p
\v 7 And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write:
\q1 ‘The Holy One, the True One,
\q2 the one having the key of David,
\q1 the one opening and no one will shut
\q2 and shutting and no one opens,
\q2 says these things: 
\v 8 “I know your works (behold, I have put before you an opened door that no one is able to shut it), that you have little power, yet you have kept my word and you have not denied my name.

\v 9 Behold, I will give {those} of the synagogue of Satan, the ones saying themselves to be Jews, but they are not, rather, they are lying, behold, I will make them so that they will come and bow down before your feet, and they will know that I have loved you.
\v 10 Because you have kept my word of endurance, I will also keep you from the hour of testing being about to come upon the whole world to test the ones living on the earth.
\v 11 I am coming quickly. Hold what you have so that no one may take your crown.

\v 12 The one conquering, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, and he will certainly not go outside anymore, and I will write on him the name of my God and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, the one coming down out of heaven from my God, and my new name.
\v 13 Let the one having an ear hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches.”’

\p
\v 14 And to the angel of the church in Laodicea write:
\p ‘The Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God, says these things:
\v 15 “I know your works, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were cold or hot!
\v 16 So, because you are lukewarm and neither hot nor cold, I am about to spew you out of my mouth.

\v 17 For you say, ‘I am rich and have become wealthy and have no need,’ and you do not know that you are the miserable and pitiable and poor and blind and naked one.
\v 18 I advise you to buy from me gold refined by fire so that you might become rich and white garments so that you might clothe yourself and the shame of your nakedness might not be shown and salve to anoint your eyes so that you might see.

\v 19 I, as many as I love, rebuke and discipline. Therefore be zealous and repent.
\v 20 Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone should hear my voice and open the door, I will indeed enter to him and I will eat with him, and he with me.

\v 21 The one conquering, I will grant to him to sit with me on my throne, as I also have conquered and have sat with my Father on his throne.
\v 22 Let the one having an ear hear what the Spirit is saying to the churches.”’”


\c 4
\p
\v 1 After these things I looked and behold, a door opened in heaven and the first voice like a trumpet that I had heard speaking with me saying, “Come up here and I will show you what must happen after these things.”
\v 2 Immediately I was in the Spirit and behold, a throne was appearing in heaven, and on the throne one sitting.
\v 3 And the one sitting {was} like in appearance to a jasper stone and to a carnelian, and a rainbow {was} around the throne, like in appearance to an emerald.

\v 4 And around the throne {were} 24 thrones, and sitting on the thrones {were} 24 elders dressed in white garments, and on their heads {were} golden crowns.
\v 5 And from the throne come out lightnings and sounds and thunders, and seven lamps of fire burn before the throne, which are the seven spirits of God.

\v 6 And before the throne {was} as a glass sea, like crystal, and in the midst of the throne and around the throne {were} four living creatures, being full of eyes before and behind.

\v 7 And the first living creature {was} like a lion, and the second living creature {was} like a calf, and the third living creature having a face as of a man, and the fourth living creature {was} like a flying eagle.
\v 8 And the four living creatures, each one of them having six wings apiece, being full of eyes around and underneath, indeed do not have rest night and day, saying,
\q1
“Holy, holy, holy, Lord God, the Ruler of All,
\q1
the one having been and the one being and the one coming.”

\m
\v 9 And whenever the living creatures will give glory and honor and thanks to the one sitting on the throne, the one living to the ages of the ages,
\v 10 the 24 elders will fall before the one sitting on the throne and worship the one living to the ages of the ages, and they will lay their crowns before the throne, saying,
\q1 
\v 11 “Worthy are you, our Lord and God,
\q2
to receive glory and honor and power,
\q1
because you have created all things,
\q2
and by your will they existed and were created.”


\c 5
\p
\v 1 And I saw in the right hand of the one sitting on the throne a scroll, written on the inside and on the back, having been sealed with seven seals.
\v 2 And I saw a mighty angel proclaiming in a loud voice, “Who {is} worthy to open the scroll and to break its seals?”

\v 3 And no one in heaven or on the earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or to read it.
\v 4 And I was weeping much because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to read it.
\v 5 And one of the elders said to me, “Do not weep. Behold, the Lion from the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered to open the scroll and its seven seals.”

\v 6 And I saw, in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing, as having been slaughtered, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent into all the earth.
\v 7 And he came and took {the scroll} from the right hand of the one sitting on the throne.

\v 8 And when he took the scroll, the four living creatures and the 24 elders fell before the Lamb, each one having a harp and golden bowls being full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.

\v 9 And they sing a new song, saying,
\q1
“You are worthy to take the scroll
\q2
and to open its seals,
\q1
because you were slaughtered and with your blood you bought {people} for God
\q2
from every tribe and language and people and nation.
\q1 
\v 10 And you made them a kingdom and priests to our God,
\q2
and they will reign on the earth.”

\m
\v 11 And I looked and heard the sound of many angels around the throne and the living creatures and the elders, and the number of them was myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands,
\v 12 saying in a loud voice,
\pi “Worthy is the Lamb having been slaughtered to receive power and wealth and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing.”

\p
\v 13 And I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and on the sea and everything in them saying,
\pi “To the one sitting on the throne and to the Lamb {be} praise and honor and glory and power to the ages of the ages.”
\p
\v 14 And the four living creatures said, “Amen!” and the elders fell down and worshiped.
\f + \ft Some older versions read \fqa the 24 elders fell down and worshiped the one who lives to the ages of the ages.\fqa*\f*


\c 6
\p
\v 1 And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures saying, as with a voice of thunder, “Come!”
\v 2 And I looked and behold, a white horse, and the one sitting on it having a bow! And a crown was given to him, and he went out conquering and that he might conquer.

\p
\v 3 And when he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature saying, “Come!”
\v 4 And another horse, fiery red, came out! And to the one sitting on it, it was granted to him to take peace from the earth, and so that they will slaughter one another, and a great sword was given to him.

\p
\v 5 And when he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature saying, “Come!” And I looked and behold, a black horse, and the one sitting on it having a balance in his hand.
\v 6 And I heard {something} like a voice in the midst of the four living creatures saying, “A choenix of wheat for a denarius and three choenices of barley for a denarius, but do not harm the oil and the wine.”

\p
\v 7 And when he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature saying, “Come!”
\v 8 And I looked, and behold, a pale horse! And the one sitting on it was named Death, and Hades was following after him. And authority was given to them over one fourth of the earth, to kill with the sword and with famine and with death and by the wild animals of the earth.

\p
\v 9 And when he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of the ones having been slaughtered because of the word of God and because of the testimony that they were having.
\v 10 And they cried out in a loud voice, saying, “Until when, holy and true Ruler, do you not judge and avenge our blood from the ones living on the earth?”
\v 11 And a white robe was given to each of them, and it was said to them that they should wait yet a little time until should be completed both their fellow servants and their brothers {who} were going to be killed as they also {were}.

\p
\v 12 And I saw when he opened the sixth seal, and a great earthquake happened, and the sun became black, like sackcloth {made} of hair, and the full moon became like blood,
\v 13 and the stars of the sky fell to the earth, as a fig tree drops its unseasonable fruit, being shaken by a great wind.
\v 14 And the sky was split like a scroll being rolled up, and all the mountains and islands were removed from their places.

\v 15 And the kings of the earth and the magnates and the chiliarchs and the rich and the powerful and every slave and free {person} hid themselves in the caves and in the rocks of the mountains,
\v 16 and they say to the mountains and to the rocks, “Fall on us and hide us from the face of the one sitting on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb,
\v 17 because the great day of their anger has come, and who is able to stand?”


\c 7
\p
\v 1 After this, I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth so that wind would not blow on the land or on the sea or on any tree.
\v 2 And I saw another angel coming up from the rising of the sun, having the seal of the living God. And he cried in a loud voice to the four angels to whom it was given to them to harm the earth and the sea,
\v 3 saying, “Do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees until we might seal the servants of our God on their foreheads.”

\v 4 And I heard the number of the ones having been sealed: 144 thousands, having been sealed from every tribe of the sons of Israel:
\q1 
\v 5 from the tribe of Judah, 12 thousands having been sealed;
\q1
from the tribe of Reuben, 12 thousands;
\q1
from the tribe of Gad, 12 thousands;
\q1 
\v 6 from the tribe of Asher, 12 thousands;
\q1
from the tribe of Naphtali, 12 thousands;
\q1
from the tribe of Manasseh, 12 thousands;
\q1 
\v 7 from the tribe of Simeon, 12 thousands;
\q1
from the tribe of Levi, 12 thousands;
\q1
from the tribe of Issachar, 12 thousands;
\q1 
\v 8 from the tribe of Zebulun, 12 thousands;
\q1
from the tribe of Joseph, 12 thousands;
\q1
from the tribe of Benjamin, 12 thousands having been sealed.

\p
\v 9 After these things I looked, and behold, a great multitude that, to number it, no one was able, from every nation and tribe and people and language, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, having been clothed in white robes, and palm branches {were} in their hands,
\v 10 and they cry out in a loud voice, saying,
\pi “Salvation {is} to our God, the one sitting on the throne, and to the Lamb!”

\m
\v 11 And all the angels had stood around the throne and the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God,
\v 12 saying,
\pi “Amen! Praise and glory and wisdom and thanks and honor and power and strength {be} to our God, to the ages of the ages! Amen!”

\m
\v 13 And one of the elders responded, saying to me, “These, the ones having been clothed in white robes, who are they, and where have they come from?”
\v 14 And I said to him, “My lord, you know.” And he said to me, “These are the ones coming from the great tribulation, and they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.

\q1 
\v 15 Because of this they are before the throne of God,
\q2
and they worship him day and night in his temple.
\q2
And the one sitting on the throne will dwell with them.
\q1 
\v 16 They will not hunger anymore, nor will they thirst anymore,
\q2
nor will the sun fall on them at all,
\q2
nor any heat,
\q1 
\v 17 because the Lamb at the midst of the throne will shepherd them
\q2
and guide them to springs of the waters of life,
\q1
and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.”


\c 8
\p
\v 1 And when he opened the seventh seal, silence happened in heaven for about half an hour.
\v 2 And I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.

\p
\v 3 And another angel came and was stationed at the altar having a golden censer, and much incense was given to him so that he would offer {it} with the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar before the throne.
\v 4 And the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, rose up before God from the hand of the angel.
\v 5 And the angel took the censer and filled it from the fire of the altar and threw {it} onto the earth, and thunders and sounds and lightnings and an earthquake happened.

\p
\v 6 And the seven angels having the seven trumpets prepared themselves that they might trumpet.
\p
\v 7 And the first trumpeted, and hail happened, and fire, mixed with blood, and it was thrown onto the earth, and a third of the earth was burned up, and a third of the trees were burned up, and all the green grass was burned up.\f + \ft Some older versions leave out \fqa and a third of the earth was burned up.\fqa*\f*

\p
\v 8 And the second angel trumpeted, and {something} like a great mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea, and a third of the sea became blood,
\v 9 and a third of the creatures having life in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.

\p
\v 10 And the third angel trumpeted, and a great star fell from the sky, burning like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of waters.
\v 11 And the name of the star is called Wormwood. And a third of the waters became wormwood, and many of the men died from the waters that had been made bitter.

\p
\v 12 And the fourth angel trumpeted, and a third of the sun was struck, and a third of the moon and a third of the stars, so that a third of them were darkened, and the day, a third of it did not shine, and likewise the night.

\p
\v 13 And I looked, and I heard an eagle\f + \ft Some copies have the word \fqa angel\fqa* instead of\fq eagle.\fq*\f*
flying in mid-heaven saying in a loud voice, “Woe, woe, woe, to the ones living on the earth from the remaining sounds of the trumpet of the three angels who are going to trumpet.”


\c 9
\p
\v 1 And the fifth angel trumpeted, and I saw a star having fallen from the sky to the earth, and the key of the shaft of the abyss was given to it.
\v 2 And he opened the shaft of the abyss, and smoke went up from the shaft like the smoke of a great furnace, and the sun and the air were darkened from the smoke of the shaft.

\v 3 And locusts came from the smoke onto the earth, and power was given to them as scorpions of the earth have power.
\v 4 And it was told to them that they should not harm the grass of the earth or any green plant or any tree, if not the men who did not have the seal of God on {their} foreheads.

\v 5 And it was given to them that they should not kill them, but that they would be tormented for five months and their torment {would be} like the torment of a scorpion when it might strike a man.
\v 6 And in those days, men will seek death, but they will certainly not find it, and they will long to die, but death flees from them.

\v 7 And the appearance of the locusts {was} like horses prepared for war. And on their heads {were something} like crowns resembling gold, and their faces {were} like faces of men.
\v 8 And they had hair like the hair of women, and their teeth were as of lions,
\v 9 and they had breastplates like iron breastplates, and the sound of their wings {was} like the sound of many chariots of horses running into battle.

\v 10 And they have tails and stingers as scorpions do, and in their tails {is} their power to harm men for five months.
\v 11 They have over them a king, the angel of the abyss. His name in Hebrew {is} Abaddon, and in Greek he has the name Apollyon.
\p
\v 12 The first woe has passed. Behold, two woes are still coming after these {things}.

\p
\v 13 And the sixth angel trumpeted, and I heard a voice from the horns of the golden altar before God,
\v 14 saying to the sixth angel, the one having the trumpet, “Release the four angels having been bound at the great river Euphrates.”
\v 15 And the four angels having been prepared for the hour and day and month and year were released so that they might kill a third of men.

\v 16 And the number of the horse soldiers {was} two myriads of myriads; I heard their number.
\v 17 And thus in the vision I saw the horses and the ones riding on them: having fiery and hyacinth and sulfurous breastplates. And the heads of the horses {were} as heads of lions, and from their mouths comes fire and smoke and sulfur.

\v 18 By these three plagues, by the fire and the smoke and the sulfur coming out from their mouths, a third of men were killed.
\v 19 For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails, for their tails {are} like snakes, having heads, and with them they injure.

\v 20 And the rest of men, the ones not killed in these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands, so that they will not worship demons and idols of gold and silver and bronze and stone and wood, which are able neither to see nor to hear nor to walk.
\v 21 And they did not repent of their murders, nor of their sorceries, nor of their sexual immorality, nor of their thefts.


\c 10
\p
\v 1 And I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven clothed in a cloud, with a rainbow above his head and his face like the sun and his feet like pillars of fire
\v 2 and having in his hand an opened little scroll. And he put his right foot on the sea and {his} left on the land,

\v 3 and he shouted in a loud voice, as a lion roars, and when he shouted, the seven thunders spoke their own voices.
\v 4 And when the seven thunders spoke, I was going to write, but I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Seal what the seven thunders said and do not write it.”

\v 5 And the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven
\v 6 and swore by the one living to the ages of the ages, who created heaven and the {things} in it and the earth and the {things} in it and the sea and the {things} in it, “There will be no more time,
\v 7 but in the days of the sound of the seventh angel, when he is going to trumpet, then the mystery of God will be accomplished, just as he proclaimed to {his} own servants the prophets.”

\v 8 And the voice that I heard from heaven was speaking with me again and saying: “Go, take the opened scroll in the hand of the angel standing on the sea and on the land.”
\v 9 And I went to the angel, telling him to give the little scroll to me. And he says to me, “Take and eat it, and it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be sweet like honey.”

\v 10 And I took the little scroll from the hand of the angel and ate it, and it was sweet like honey in my mouth, but when I had eaten it, my stomach was made bitter.
\v 11 And they said to me, “It is necessary for you to prophesy again about many peoples and nations and languages and kings.”


\c 11
\p
\v 1 And a reed like a measuring rod was given to me, saying, “Get up and measure the temple of God and the altar and the ones worshiping in it.
\v 2 But cast out the courtyard outside the temple and do not measure it, for it has been given to the Gentiles, and they will trample the holy city for 42 months.

\v 3 And I will grant to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for 1, 260 days, clothed in sackcloth.”
\v 4 These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth.
\v 5 And if anyone wishes to harm them, fire comes out from their mouth and devours their enemies, and if anyone should wish to harm them, he must be killed in this way.

\v 6 They have authority to close up the sky so that no rain might fall during the days of their prophesy, and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood and to strike the earth with every plague as often as they may desire.
\v 7 And when they finish their testimony, the beast coming up from the abyss will make war against them, and he will conquer them and kill them.

\v 8 And their corpses {will be} in the public square of the great city, which is spiritually called Sodom and Egypt, where also their Lord was crucified.
\v 9 And those from people and tribe and language and nation look at their corpses for three and a half days, and they do not permit their corpses to be placed in a tomb.

\v 10 And the ones living on the earth rejoice over them and celebrate and send gifts to one another, because these two prophets tormented the ones living on the earth.
\v 11 But after three and a half days, a breath of life from God entered into them and they stood on their feet, and great fear fell on the ones seeing them.
\v 12 And they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, “Come up here!” And they went up into heaven in a cloud, and their enemies watched them.

\v 13 And at that hour a great earthquake happened, and a tenth of the city fell. And in the earthquake, the names of 7, 000 men were killed, and the rest became terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.
\p
\v 14 The second woe has passed. Behold, the third woe is coming quickly.

\p
\v 15 And the seventh angel trumpeted, and loud voices happened in heaven, saying,
\q1
“The kingdom of the world has become {the kingdom} of our Lord and of his Christ,
\q1
and he will reign to the ages of the ages.”

\m
\v 16 And the 24 elders sitting on their thrones before God fell upon their faces and worshiped God,
\v 17 saying,
\q1
“We give thanks to you, Lord God, Ruler of All, the one being and the one having been,
\q1
because indeed you have taken your great power and have reigned.
\f + \ft Some copies read \fqa the ruler over all, the one {who} is, and {who} was, and {who} is to come,\fqa* but most modern versions do not.\f*

\q1 
\v 18 And the nations were enraged,
\q2
but your wrath has come
\q2
and the time for the dead to be judged,
\q1
and to give a reward to your servants
\q2
the prophets and to the saints
\q2
and to the ones fearing your name,
\q2
the small and the great,
\q1
and to destroy the ones destroying the earth.”

\p
\v 19 And the temple of God in heaven was opened and the ark of the covenant of the Lord was seen in his temple. And flashes of lightning and loud sounds and crashes of thunder and an earthquake and a great hailstorm happened.


\c 12
\p
\v 1 And a great sign was seen in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and a crown of 12 stars on her head,
\v 2 and having in the womb, and she cries out, suffering birth pains and being tormented to give birth.

\v 3 And another sign was seen in heaven: and behold, a large red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven diadems on his heads.
\v 4 And his tail sweeps away a third of the stars of heaven and hurled them down to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman being about to give birth so that when she gave birth he might devour her child.

\v 5 And she gave birth to a son, a male, who is going to rule all the nations with an iron scepter. And her child was snatched away to God and to his throne,
\v 6 and the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God there so that they might nourish her there for 1, 260 days.

\p
\v 7 And a war happened in heaven. Michael and his angels fought with the dragon, and the dragon and his angels fought {them}.
\v 8 But he was not strong enough, nor was a place found for them any longer in heaven.
\v 9 And the great dragon was thrown down, the ancient serpent called Diabolos and Satan, the one deceiving the whole world. He was thrown down to the earth and his angels were thrown down with him.

\v 10 And I heard a loud voice in heaven saying,
\q1
“Now have come the salvation and the power
\q2
and the kingdom of our God,
\q2
and the authority of his Christ,
\q1
because the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down,
\q2
the one accusing them before our God day and night.

\q1 
\v 11 And they conquered him through the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony,
\q1
indeed, they did not love their lives unto death.
\q1 
\v 12 Therefore, rejoice, heavens,
\q2
and the ones dwelling in them!
\q1
Woe to the earth and the sea,
\q2
because the devil has gone down to you,
\q1
having great anger,
\q2
knowing that he has little time!”

\p
\v 13 And when the dragon saw that he had been thrown down to the earth, he pursued the woman who had borne the male.
\v 14 But two wings of a great eagle were given to the woman so that she might fly to the wilderness, to her place where she is nourished there for a time and times and half a time, away from the face of the serpent.

\v 15 And the serpent poured water like a river out from his mouth after the woman so that he might make her stream-borne.
\v 16 But the earth helped the woman, indeed, the earth opened its mouth and swallowed the river that the dragon poured out from his mouth.
\v 17 And the dragon was enraged at the woman and went off to make war with the rest of her seed, the ones keeping the commandments of God and having the testimony of Jesus.
\v 18 And he stood on the sand of the sea.\f + \ft Some manuscripts place this sentence at the beginning of 13:1, but the best manuscripts place it here as 12:18.\f*


\c 13
\p
\v 1 And I saw a beast coming up from the sea, having ten horns and seven heads, and on its horns {were} ten crowns, and on its heads {was} a blasphemous name.\f + \ft Some manuscripts include \fqa Then he stood on the sand of the seashore \fqa* at the beginning of this verse, but the best manuscripts include it as 12:18.\f*
\v 2 And the beast that I saw was like a leopard and its feet {were} as of a bear and its mouth {was} as the mouth of a lion, and the dragon gave to it his power and his throne and great authority.

\v 3 And one of its heads {was} as if it had been slain unto death, but its wound of death had been healed. And the whole earth was astonished after the beast,
\v 4 and they worshiped the dragon because he had given authority to the beast, and they worshiped the beast, saying, “Who {is} like the beast, and who is able to war with it?”

\v 5 And to it was given a mouth speaking great {things} and blasphemies, and authority was given to it to act for 42 months.
\v 6 And it opened its mouth unto blasphemies against God, to blaspheme his name and his dwelling, the ones dwelling in heaven.

\v 7 And to it was granted to make war with the saints and to conquer them, and authority was given to it over every tribe and people and language and nation.
\v 8 And all the ones living on the earth will worship it, of whom his name has not been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb having been slain from the foundation of the world.

\v 9 If anyone has an ear, let him hear.
\v 10 If anyone {is} for captivity, he departs; if anyone will be killed by the sword, it is necessary for him to be killed by the sword. Here is the endurance and the faith of the saints.

\p
\v 11 And I saw another beast coming up from the earth, and it had two horns like a lamb but it was speaking like a dragon.
\v 12 And it exercises all the authority of the first beast before it, and it makes the earth and the ones living on it that they will worship the first beast, of whom his wound of death had been healed.

\v 13 And it does great signs, so that it might even cause fire to come down from heaven to the earth before men.
\v 14 And it deceives the ones living on the earth through the signs that have been granted to it to do before the beast, telling the ones living on the earth to make an image to the beast that has the wound of the sword and has lived.

\v 15 And it was granted to it to give breath to the image of the beast so that the image of the beast might even speak and might cause whoever does not worship the image of the beast to be killed.
\v 16 And it causes everyone, the small and the great and the rich and the poor and the free and the slave, that they might give to them a mark on their right hand or on their forehead,
\v 17 and that no one would be able to buy or to sell except the one having the mark, the name of the beast or the number of its name.

\v 18 Here is wisdom: The one having understanding, let him calculate the number of the beast. For it is the number of a man, and its number is 666.


\c 14
\p
\v 1 And I looked and behold, the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with him {were} 144 thousands having his name and the name of his Father written on their foreheads.
\v 2 And I heard a sound from heaven like the sound of many waters and like the sound of great thunder, and the sound that I heard {was} like harpists harping on their harps.

\v 3 And they sing a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and the elders, and no one was able to learn the song except the 144 thousands having been bought from the earth.
\v 4 These are they who have not been defiled with women, for they are virgins. These are the ones following the Lamb wherever he goes. These have been bought from among men as first fruits for God and for the Lamb,
\v 5 and no lie has been found in their mouth, for they are blameless.\f + \ft Some older copies add \fqa before the throne of God.\fqa*\f*

\p
\v 6 And I saw another angel flying in midair, having the eternal gospel to proclaim to the ones living on the earth, even to every nation and tribe and language and people,
\v 7 saying in a loud voice, “Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has come, and worship the one having made the heaven and the earth and the sea and the springs of water.”

\p
\v 8 And another, a second, followed, saying, “Fallen, fallen has Babylon the Great, who caused all the nations to drink from the wine of the passion of her immorality!”

\p
\v 9 And another angel, a third, followed them, saying in a loud voice, “If anyone worships the beast and his image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand,
\v 10 he will also drink from the wine of the wrath of God having been poured undiluted into the cup of his anger, and he will be tormented with fire and sulfur before the holy angels and before the Lamb.

\v 11 And the smoke of their torment goes up to the ages of the ages, and they have no rest day and night, the ones worshiping the beast and his image and if anyone receives the mark of his name.
\v 12 Here is the endurance of the saints, the ones keeping the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.”

\p
\v 13 And I heard a voice from heaven saying, “Write, ‘Blessed {are} the dead dying in the Lord from now on.’” “Yes,” says the Spirit, “so they will rest from their labors, for their deeds follow with them.”

\p
\v 14 And I looked and behold, a white cloud, and sitting on the cloud one like a son of man, having a golden crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand.
\v 15 And another angel came out of the temple, crying out in a loud voice to the one sitting on the cloud: “Extend your sickle and reap, because the time to reap has come, since the harvest of the earth has been ripened.”
\v 16 And the one sitting on the cloud swung his sickle upon the earth, and the earth was harvested.

\p
\v 17 And another angel came out from the temple in heaven, also having a sharp sickle himself.
\v 18 And another angel {came} from the altar, the one having authority over the fire, and he shouted in a loud voice to the one having the sharp sickle, saying, “Send out your sharp sickle and gather the clusters of the grapevine of the earth, for their grapes have ripened.”

\v 19 And the angel swung his sickle to the earth and harvested the grapevine of the earth, and he threw {the grapes} into the great winepress of the wrath of God.
\v 20 And the winepress was trampled outside the city, and blood came out from the winepress up to the bridles of the horses for 1, 600 stadia.


\c 15
\p
\v 1 And I saw another great and marvelous sign in heaven: seven angels having seven final plagues, for with them the wrath of God was finished.

\p
\v 2 Then I saw as it were a sea of glass having been mixed with fire and the ones being victorious over the beast and over his image and over the number of his name standing on the sea of glass having the harps of God.

\v 3 And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God and the song of the Lamb, saying,
\q1
“Great and marvelous {are} your deeds,
\q2
Lord God, Ruler of All.
\q1
Righteous and true {are} your ways,
\q2
King of the Ages.\f + \ft Some manuscripts read \fqa nations\fqa* instead of\fq ages.\fq*\f*
\q1 
\v 4 Who will certainly not fear {you}, Lord,
\q2
and glorify your name?
\q1
For {you} alone {are} holy.
\q2
For all the nations will come
\q2
and worship before you,
\q1
because your righteous deeds have been manifested.”

\p
\v 5 And after these things I looked, and the temple of the dwelling of the testimony in heaven had been opened.
\v 6 And the seven angels having the seven plagues came out from the temple, having been clothed with clean, bright linen and with golden sashes having been wrapped around {their} chests.

\v 7 And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls being full of the wrath of the God living to the ages of the ages.
\v 8 And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power, and no one was able to enter into the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels were completed.


\c 16
\p
\v 1 And I heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels, “Go and pour out the seven bowls of the wrath of God onto the earth.”

\p
\v 2 And the first went and poured out his bowl on the earth, and a bad and harmful sore happened on the men having the mark of the beast and the ones worshiping its image.

\p
\v 3 And the second poured out his bowl into the sea and it became blood as of a corpse, and every living soul in the sea died.

\p
\v 4 And the third poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of water, and it became blood.
\v 5 And I heard the angel of the waters saying,
\q1
“You are righteous, the one being and the one who was, the Holy One,
\q2
because you have judged these.
\f + \ft Some older copies read \fqa You are righteous, Lord—the one who is and who was and who is to be, because you have judged these things.\fqa*\f*
\q1 
\v 6 Because they poured out the blood of the saints and prophets,
\q2
you have also given blood to them to drink;
\q1
they are worthy.”
\m
\v 7 And I heard the altar saying,
\q1
“Yes, Lord God, Ruler of All,
\q2
your judgments {are} true and righteous.”

\p
\v 8 And the fourth poured out his bowl on the sun, and it was granted to it to scorch men with fire.
\v 9 And men were scorched a great scorch and they blasphemed the name of the God having authority over these plagues, but they did not repent to give him glory.

\p
\v 10 And the fifth poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and its kingdom became darkened. And they were chewing their tongues from the pain,
\v 11 and they blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pain and because of their sores, but they did not repent of their deeds.

\p
\v 12 And the sixth poured out his bowl upon the great river, the Euphrates, and its water was dried up so that the way of the kings from the rising of the sun might be prepared.
\v 13 And I saw, out from the mouth of the dragon and out from the mouth of the beast and out from the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs,
\v 14 for they are spirits of demons performing signs, who go out to the kings of the whole world to gather them together for battle on the great day of God, the Ruler of All.

\v 15 (“Behold! I am coming like a thief! Blessed {is} the one watching and keeping his garments so that he might not walk around naked and they see his indecency.”)
\v 16 And they brought them together at the place called Armageddon in Hebrew.

\p
\v 17 And the seventh poured out his bowl upon the air, and a loud voice came out from the temple from the throne, saying, “It has happened!”
\v 18 And lightning and sounds and thunder happened, and a great earthquake happened, such as had not happened since man had been on the earth, so powerful an earthquake, so great.
\v 19 And the great city came into three parts and the cities of the nations fell, and Babylon the Great was remembered before God to give to her the cup of the wine of the wrath of his anger.

\v 20 And every island fled, and the mountains were not found.
\v 21 And great hail, about a talent in weight, comes down from heaven upon men, and men blasphemed God because of the plague of hail, because that plague is exceedingly great.


\c 17
\p
\v 1 And one of the seven angels holding the seven bowls came and spoke with me, saying, “Come, I will show you the judgment of the great prostitute sitting on many waters,
\v 2 with whom the kings of the earth committed sexual immorality and the ones living {on} the earth were intoxicated from the wine of her sexual immorality.”

\v 3 And he carried me away in the Spirit to a wilderness, and I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast being full of blasphemous names, having seven heads and ten horns.
\v 4 And the woman was clothed in purple and scarlet and adorned with gold and precious stone and pearls, holding in her hand a golden cup being full of abominations and the impurities of her sexual immorality,
\v 5 and on her forehead had been written a name, a mystery: Babylon the Great, the Mother of Prostitutes and of the Abominations of the Earth.

\v 6 And I saw the woman being drunk from the blood of the saints and from the blood of the witnesses of Jesus and, having seen her, I wondered a great wonder.
\v 7 But the angel said to me, “Why are you wondering? I will tell to you the mystery of the woman and of the beast carrying her having the seven heads and the ten horns.

\v 8 The beast that you saw was and is not but is about to come up from the abyss, and it is going to destruction, and the ones living on the earth whose names have not been written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world will wonder, seeing the beast that was and is not but will come.

\v 9 Here {is} the mind having wisdom: The seven heads are seven hills where the woman is sitting on them, and they are seven kings;
\v 10 the five have fallen, the one is, the other has not yet come, and when he comes, it is necessary for him to remain a little.

\v 11 And the beast that was and is not is itself also an eighth, but it is from the seven and is going to destruction.

\v 12 And the ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom, but they are receiving authority as kings with the beast for one hour.
\v 13 These have one mind, and they give their power and authority to the beast.
\v 14 They will make war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will conquer them because he is Lord of lords and King of kings and the ones with him {are} called and chosen and faithful.”

\v 15 And he says to me, “The waters that you saw, where the prostitute sits, are peoples and multitudes and nations and languages.

\v 16 And the ten horns that you saw and the beast, they will hate the prostitute and they will make her desolated and naked and they will consume her flesh and they will burn her completely with fire,
\v 17 for God has put into their hearts to do his purpose and to do one purpose and to give their kingdom to the beast until the words of God will be fulfilled.

\v 18 And the woman whom you saw is the great city having a kingdom over the kings of the earth.”


\c 18
\p
\v 1 After these things I saw another angel coming down from heaven, having great authority, and the earth was illuminated by his glory.
\v 2 And he cried out in a mighty voice, saying,
\q1
“Babylon the Great has fallen!
\q2
And she has become a habitation of demons
\q1
and a hold of every unclean spirit
\q2
and a hold of every unclean and detested bird.\f + \ft Some manuscripts read \fqa Fallen, fallen.\fqa*\f*
\q1 
\v 3 For all the nations have drunk from the wine of her immoral passion
\q2
and the kings of the earth have committed sexual immorality with her
\q1
and the merchants of the earth have become rich from the power of her luxury.”

\q1 
\v 4 And I heard another voice from heaven saying,
\q2
“Come out from her, my people,
\q3
so that you might not share in her sins
\q2
and so that you might not receive from her plagues.
\q1 
\v 5 For her sins have been heaped as far as heaven,
\q2
and God has remembered her offenses.
\q1 
\v 6 Give back to her even as she has given,
\q2
and double doubles {to her} according to her deeds;
\q2
in the cup that she mixed, mix double for her.

\q1 
\v 7 As much as she glorified herself and lived in luxury,
\q2
give her just as much torture and grief.
\q1
For she says in her heart,
\q2
‘I sit {as} a queen
\q1
and I am not a widow
\q2
and I will certainly not see mourning.’
\q1 
\v 8 Because of this in one day her plagues will come:
\q2
death and mourning and famine,
\q1
and she will be consumed by fire,
\q2
for the Lord God judging her {is} mighty.”

\m
\v 9 And the kings of the earth, the ones having committed sexual immorality and having lived in luxury with her, will weep and wail over her when they see the smoke of her burning,
\v 10 standing from afar because of the fear of her torment, saying,
\q1
“Woe, woe, the great city,
\q2
Babylon, the mighty city!
\q1
For in one hour your judgment has come.”

\m
\v 11 And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn for her, because no one buys their cargo anymore—
\v 12 cargo of gold and silver and precious stone and pearls and fine linen and purple cloth and silk and scarlet cloth and every citron wood and every ivory vessel and every vessel from the costliest wood and bronze and iron and marble
\v 13 and cinnamon and spice and incense and myrrh and frankincense and wine and oil and fine flour and wheat and cattle and sheep and horses and chariots and bodies and souls of men.

\v 14 And your autumn fruit of the desire of {your} soul has gone away from you, and all the luxurious and the splendid has perished from you, and they will certainly not be found any longer.

\v 15 The merchants of these things, having become rich, will stand afar off from her because of the fear of her torment, weeping and mourning,
\m
\v 16 saying,
\q1
“Woe, woe to the great city
\q2
having been dressed in fine linen
\q3
and purple and scarlet
\q2
and adorned with gold
\q3
and precious stones and pearls,
\q2 
\v 17 for in one hour so much wealth has been destroyed.”
\m
And every shipmaster and every one sailing to a place and sailors and as many as work the sea stood from afar

\m
\v 18 and were crying out, seeing the smoke of her burning, saying, “What {is} like the great city?”
\v 19 And they threw dust on their heads and cried out, weeping and mourning, saying,
\q1
“Woe, woe, the great city,
\q2
by which all the ones having ships in the sea
\q2
became rich from her wealth,
\q1
for in one hour she has been destroyed.”
\q1 
\v 20 (“Rejoice over her, heaven,
\q2
also you saints and apostles and prophets,
\q1
for God has judged your judgment against her!”)

\p
\v 21 And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw {it} into the sea, saying,
\q1
“Thus Babylon, the great city,
\q2
will be thrown down with violence,
\q2
and she will certainly not be seen anymore,
\q1 
\v 22 and the sound of harpists and musicians
\q3
and flutists and trumpeters
\q2
will certainly not be heard in you anymore,
\q1
and every craftsman
\q2
will certainly not be found in you anymore,
\q1
and the sound of a mill
\q2
will certainly not be heard in you anymore.

\q1 
\v 23 And the light of a lamp
\q2
will certainly not shine in you anymore,
\q1
and the voice of a bridegroom and a bride
\q2
will certainly not be heard in you anymore,
\q1
for your merchants were the great ones of the earth
\q2
because all the nations were deceived by your sorcery.
\q1 
\v 24 And in her was found the blood of prophets and saints
\q2
and of all the ones having been slain on the earth.”


\c 19
\p
\v 1 After these things I heard as it were the loud voice of a large crowd in heaven saying,
\q1
“Hallelujah!
\q1
Salvation and glory and power to our God,
\q2 
\v 2 for his judgments {are} true and righteous,
\q1
for he has judged the great prostitute
\q2
who was corrupting the earth with her sexual immorality,
\q1
and he has avenged the blood of his servants
\q2
from her hand.”

\m
\v 3 And they spoke a second {time}:
\q1
“Hallelujah!
\q1
Yes, the smoke of her rises to the ages of the ages.”
\m
\v 4 And the 24 elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God, the One sitting on the throne, saying,
\q1
“Amen. Hallelujah!”

\m
\v 5 And a voice came out from the throne, saying,
\q1
“Praise our God,
\q2
all his servants
\q1
and the ones fearing him,
\q2
the small and the great.”

\m
\v 6 And I heard as it were the sound of a great crowd and as it were the sound of many waters and as it were the sound of powerful thunder, saying,
\q1
“Hallelujah!
\q1
For the Lord our God, the Ruler of All, reigns.

\q1 
\v 7 Let us rejoice and exult
\q2
and give glory to him
\q1
because the wedding of the Lamb has come
\q2
and his bride has made herself ready
\q1 
\v 8 and it has been granted to her that she might be dressed
\q2
in bright, clean fine linen.”
\q1
(For fine linen is the righteous acts of the saints.)

\p
\v 9 And he says to me, “Write, ‘Blessed {are} the ones having been called to the supper of the wedding of the Lamb.’” And he says to me, “These are true words of God.”
\v 10 And I fell before his feet to worship him, but he says to me, “See not! I am a fellow servant of you and your brothers having the testimony of Jesus. Worship God! For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.”

\p
\v 11 And I saw heaven having been opened and behold, a white horse and the one riding on it, being called Faithful and True, and he judges and makes war in righteousness,
\v 12 his eyes also {being} a flame of fire, and many crowns {being} on his head, having a name written that no one knows except himself,
\v 13 and having been clothed with a robe dipped in blood; and his name is called the Word of God.

\v 14 And the armies in heaven were following him on white horses, having been clothed in fine linen, white and clean.
\v 15 And from his mouth goes out a sharp sword so that with it he might strike the nations, and he will rule them with an iron scepter, and he tramples the winepress of the wine of the wrath of the fury of God, the Ruler of All.
\v 16 And he has a name written on {his} robe and on his thigh: King of Kings and Lord of Lords.

\p
\v 17 And I saw an angel standing in the sun, and he cried out in a loud voice, saying to all the birds flying in midheaven, “Come, be gathered together for the great supper of God,
\v 18 so that you might eat the flesh of kings and the flesh of chiliarchs and the flesh of the mighty and the flesh of horses and of the ones sitting on them and the flesh of all, both of free and of slaves and of small and of great.”

\p
\v 19 And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth and their armies having been gathered to make war with the one sitting on the horse and with his army.
\v 20 And the beast was captured and with him the false prophet having performed signs before him, by which he deceived the ones having received the mark of the beast and the ones worshiping his image. The two were thrown living into the lake of fire burning with sulfur.

\v 21 And the rest were killed by the sword of the one sitting on the horse, coming out from his mouth, and all the birds were gorged with their flesh.


\c 20
\p
\v 1 And I saw an angel coming down from heaven having the key to the abyss and a great chain in his hand.
\v 2 And he seized the dragon, the ancient serpent, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years.
\v 3 And he threw him into the abyss and shut it and sealed it over him so that he would not deceive the nations anymore until the thousand years were ended. After that, it is necessary for him to be released for a short time.

\p
\v 4 And I saw thrones, and they sat on them and judgment was given to them, both the souls of the ones having been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of God and those who did not worship the beast or his image and did not receive the mark on the forehead or on their hand. And they lived and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.
\v 5 (The rest of the dead did not live until the thousand years were ended.) This {is} the first resurrection.
\v 6 Blessed and holy {is} the one having a part in the first resurrection! Over these the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and they will reign with him for a thousand years.

\p
\v 7 But when the thousand years are ended, Satan will be released from his prison,
\v 8 and he will go out to deceive the nations at the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle, of whom their number {will be} like the sand of the sea.

\v 9 And they went up on the breadth of the earth and surrounded the encampment of the saints and the beloved city, but fire came down from heaven and devoured them.
\v 10 And the devil deceiving them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur where the beast and the false prophet {were}, and they will be tormented day and night to the ages of the ages.

\p
\v 11 And I saw a great white throne and the one sitting on it, from whose face earth and heaven fled, and no place was found for them.
\v 12 And I saw the dead, both the great and the small, standing before the throne, and books were opened, and another book was opened, which is the {Book} of Life. And the dead were judged from the {things} written in the books, according to their deeds.

\v 13 And the sea gave up the dead in it, and Death and Hades gave up the dead in them, and they were judged, each one, according to their deeds.
\v 14 And Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire.
\v 15 And if anyone was not found written in the Book of Life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.


\c 21
\p
\v 1 And I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had gone away, and the sea was no more.
\v 2 And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared like a bride adorned for her husband.

\v 3 And I heard a great voice from the throne saying, “Behold! The dwelling of God {is} with men, and he will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them.\f + \ft Some manuscripts add \fqa as their God,\fqa* but the best manuscripts do not.\f*
\v 4 And he will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death will not be any longer, nor grieving, nor crying, nor pain. They will not be any longer; the first {things} have gone away.”

\v 5 And the one sitting on the throne said, “Behold! I make all {things} new.” And he says to me, “Write, for these words are trustworthy and true.”
\v 6 And he said to me, “It has happened! I {am} the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To the one thirsting I will give freely from the spring of the water of life.

\v 7 The one conquering will inherit these {things}, and I will be his God, and he will be my son.
\v 8 But for the cowardly and the unbelieving and the abhorred and murderers and fornicators and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars, their place {will be} in the lake burning with fire and sulfur, which is the second death.”

\p
\v 9 And one of the seven angels holding the seven bowls being full of the seven last plagues came and spoke with me, saying, “Come, I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb.”
\v 10 And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great and high mountain, and he showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God,

\v 11 having the glory of God, its brilliance {being} like a most precious stone, like a stone of jasper shining like crystal.
\v 12 having a great and high wall having 12 gates and 12 angels at the gates and names having been written that are the 12 tribes of the sons of Israel.
\v 13 On the east {were} three gates, and on the north {were} three gates, and on the south {were} three gates, and on the west {were} three gates.

\v 14 And the wall of the city had 12 foundations, and on them {were} the 12 names of the 12 apostles of the Lamb.
\v 15 And the one speaking with me had a golden measuring rod so that he might measure the city and her gates and her wall.

\v 16 And the city is laid out square, and her length {is} as much as the width. And he measured the city with the rod to 12, 000 stadia: Her length and width and height are equal.
\v 17 And he measured her wall, 144 cubits by the measurement of a man, which is of an angel.

\v 18 And the material of her wall {is} jasper, and the city {is} pure gold, like pure glass.
\v 19 The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every precious stone. The first foundation {was} jasper, the second sapphire, the third chalcedony, the fourth emerald,
\v 20 the fifth sardonyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst.

\v 21 And the 12 gates {were} 12 pearls; each one of the gates individually was from one pearl, and the street of the city {was} pure gold, like transparent glass.
\v 22 And I saw no temple in her, for the Lord God, the Ruler of All, is her temple, and the Lamb.

\v 23 And the city has no need of the sun, nor of the moon, that they might illumine her, for the glory of God illumined {her}, and her lamp {is} the Lamb.
\v 24 And the nations will walk by the light of her, and the kings of the earth bring their glory into her.\f + \ft Some older copies read \fqa The nations that are saved will walk by the light of that city.\fqa*\f*
\v 25 And her gates will certainly not be shut by day, for night will not be there.

\v 26 And they will bring the glory and the honor of the nations into her,
\v 27 but everything unclean will certainly not enter into her and the one doing abomination and falsehood, if not the ones having been written in the Book of Life of the Lamb.


\c 22
\p
\v 1 And he showed to me the river of the water of life, clear as crystal, flowing out from the throne of God and of the Lamb,
\v 2 in the middle of its public square. And on this side and on that side of the river {was} the tree of life, bearing 12 fruits, giving its fruit according to each month, and the leaves of the tree {are} for the healing of the nations.

\v 3 And there will no longer be any curse, and the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants will serve him.
\v 4 And they will see his face, and his name {will be} on their foreheads.
\v 5 And there will be no more night, and they have no need of {the} light of a lamp or of the light of the sun, because the Lord God will shine on them, and they will reign to the ages of the ages.

\p
\v 6 And he said to me, “These words {are} trustworthy and true, and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent his angel to show his servants what must happen soon.”
\v 7 “And behold, I am coming quickly! Blessed {is} the one keeping the words of the prophecy of this book.”

\p
\v 8 And I, John, {am} the one seeing and hearing these {things}. And when I heard and saw them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel showing me these {things}.
\v 9 But he says to me, “See not! I am a fellow servant of you and of your brothers the prophets and of the ones keeping the words of this book. Worship God!”

\p
\v 10 And he says to me, “Do not seal the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near.
\v 11 Let the one being unrighteous still be unrighteous, and let the filthy {one} still be filthy, and let the righteous {one} still do righteousness, and let the holy {one} still be holy.

\p

\v 12 Behold, I am coming quickly, and my reward {is} with me, to render to each one as his work is.
\v 13 I {am} the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.

\v 14 Blessed {are} the ones washing their robes so that their authority over the tree of life will be and they may enter into the city by the gates.
\f + \ft Instead of \fq Blessed are those who wash their robes,\fq* some older copies read \fqa Blessed are those who do his commandments.\fqa*\f*
\v 15 Outside {are} dogs and sorcerers and the sexually immoral and murderers and idolaters and everyone loving and doing falsehood.

\p
\v 16 I, Jesus, have sent my angel to testify these things to you concerning the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, the bright morning star.”

\p
\v 17 And the Spirit and the Bride say, “Come!” And let the one hearing say, “Come!” And the one thirsting, let him come. The one desiring, let him take the water of life freely.

\p
\v 18 I testify to everyone hearing the words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone might add to them, God will add to him the plagues written in this book.
\v 19 And if anyone might take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his share from the tree of life and from the holy city written in this book.
\f + \ft Some older copies read \fqa God will take away his share from the Book of Life and from the holy city written in this book.\fqa*\f*

\p
\v 20 The one testifying these {things} says, “Yes! I am coming quickly.” Amen! Come, Lord Jesus!
\p
\v 21 The grace of the Lord Jesus {be} with the saints. Amen.
