\v 1 And Solomon the son of David strengthened himself over his kingdom, and Yahweh his God was with him and made him exceedingly great.

\ts\*
\v 2 And Solomon said to all Israel, to the chiefs of thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every prince of all Israel, the heads of the fathers.
\v 3 And Solomon went and all the assembly with him to the high place that was at Gibeon, for there was the tent of meeting of God, which Moses the servant of Yahweh, had made in the wilderness.
\v 4 However, the Box of God David had brought up from Kiriath Jearim to where David prepared for it, for he pitched a tent for it in Jerusalem.
\v 5 And the bronze altar which Bezalel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, made was there before the tabernacle of Yahweh; and Solomon and the assembly sought him.\f + \ft Some older versions have, \fqa the bronze altar made by Bezalel son of Uri son of Hur, he placed there before the tabernacle of Yahweh\fqa*, where \fqa he\fqa* refers to David.\f*

\ts\*
\v 6 And Solomon went up there to the bronze altar before Yahweh, which was at the tent of meeting, and he brought up on it 1, 000 burnt offerings.
\p
\v 7 In that night, God appeared to Solomon, and he said to him, “Ask what I should give to you.”

\ts\*
\v 8 And Solomon said to God, “You yourself did with David my father great covenant faithfulness and have made me king in his place.
\v 9 Now, Yahweh God, may your word with David my father be confirmed, for you yourself have made me king over a people numerous as the dust of the earth.
\v 10 Now wisdom and knowledge give to me, and I will go out before this people, and I will come in, for who can judge this great people of yours?”
\v 11 And God said to Solomon, “Because this was in your heart, and you have not asked for wealth, riches, or glory, or the life of those who hate you, and also many days you did not ask, but you have asked for yourself wisdom and knowledge with which you will judge my people, which I made you king over them,

\ts\*
\v 12 wisdom and knowledge are given to you, and wealth, and riches, and glory I will give to you which were not thus to the kings who were before you, and after you will not be thus.”
\v 13 And Solomon came from the high place that was at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tent of meeting; and he was king over Israel.

\ts\*
\p
\v 14 And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen, and there was to him 1, 400 chariots and 12, 000 horsemen, and he placed them in the chariot cities, and with the king in Jerusalem.
\v 15 And the king made silver and gold in Jerusalem as the stones, and cedars he made as the sycamore trees that were in the lowlands in abundance.

\ts\*
\v 16 And the source of the horses which were to Solomon was from Egypt and from Kue; the traders of the king, they would take at a price from Kue.
\v 17 And they brought up and brought out from Egypt a chariot for 600 silver, and a horse for 150. And thus, according to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Aram, by their hands, they brought out.

\v 1 And Solomon said to build a house for the name of Yahweh and a house for his kingdom.
\v 2 And Solomon counted 70, 000 men as burden bearers, and 80, 000 men as stonemasons in the hills, and directors over them 3, 600.
\v 3 And Solomon sent to Hiram, the king of Tyre, saying, “Just as you did with David my father and sent to him cedars to build for himself a house to dwell in it.

\ts\*
\v 4 Behold, I am building a house for the name of Yahweh my God, to consecrate to him, to sacrifice before him spiced incense and the regular display, and burnt offerings in the morning and in the evening, on the Sabbaths and on the new moons, and the appointed times of Yahweh our God. Forever, this is over Israel.
\v 5 And the house that I am building will be great, for great is our God more than all gods.
\ts\*
\v 6 But who can keep strength to build for him a house, since the heavens and the heavens of the heavens do not contain him? And who am I that I would build for him a house, except to sacrifice before him?
\v 7 And now, send to me a wise man to work in gold, and in silver, and in bronze, and in iron, and in purple and crimson and violet, and one who knows how to engrave engravings; with the wise who are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father prepared.

\ts\*
\v 8 And send to me trees of cedar, cypress, and algum from Lebanon, for I myself know that your servants know how to cut trees of Lebanon. And behold, my servants will be with your servants,
\v 9 in order to prepare for me trees in abundance, for the house which I am building will be great and marvelous.
\v 10 And behold, to the wood cutters, to the ones who cut the trees, I will give crushed wheat to your servants 20, 000 cors, and barley 20, 000 cors, and wine 20, 000 baths, and oil 20, 000 baths.”\f + \ft Some versions have, \fqa twenty thousand cors of wheat as food\fqa*.\f*

\p
\v 11 And Hiram, the king of Tyre, said in a writing, and sent to Solomon: “Because Yahweh loves his people, he has placed you over them as king.”
\v 12 And Hiram said, “Blessed be Yahweh, the God of Israel, who made the heavens and the earth, who has given to David the king a son of wisdom, knowing insight and understanding, who will build a house for Yahweh and a house for his kingdom.

\ts\*
\v 13 And now, I have sent a wise man, knowing understanding, Huram-Abi,
\v 14 a son of a woman from the daughters of Dan, and his father a man of Tyre, knowing to work in gold, and in silver, in bronze, in iron, in stones, and in trees, in purple, in violet, and in fine linen, and in crimson, and to engrave any engraving and to devise any device, which is given to him with your wise ones and the wise ones of my lord, David, your father.

\ts\*
\v 15 And now, the wheat and the barley, the oil and the wine, which my lord has said, let him send to his servants.
\v 16 And we ourselves will cut trees from Lebanon, according to all your need, and we will bring them to you by rafts by sea to Joppa, and you yourself will bring them up to Jerusalem.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 17 And Solomon counted all the men, the foreigners who were in the land of Israel, after the census that David, his father, had counted them. And there were found 153, 600.
\v 18 And he made from them 70, 000 burden bearers, 80, 000 stonemasons in the hills, and 3, 600 directors to cause the people to work.

\v 1 And Solomon began to build the house of Yahweh in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where he had appeared to David his father, where David prepared in the place at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite.
\v 2 And he began to build in the second month on the second, in the fourth year of his reign.
\v 3 And these were the founding of Solomon to build the house of God, the length in cubits by the former measure, 60 cubits, and the width 20 cubits.

\ts\*
\v 4 And the porch which is at the front, the length on the front of the width of the house, 20 cubits, and the height, 120. And he overlaid it from within with pure gold.

\v 9 And the weight of the nails was 50 shekels of gold and the upper rooms he overlaid with gold.

\ts\*
\p
\v 10 And he made in the house of the holy of holies two cherubim, a work of casting; and he overlaid them with gold.\f + \ft Some versions have, \fqa two wooden images of cherubim\fqa*.\f*
\v 11 And the wings of the cherubim, their length was 20 cubits, one wing was five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house, and another wing five cubits, reaching to a wing of the other cherub.
\v 12 And the wing of the other cherub five cubits, reaching to the wall of the house; and the other wing five cubits, clinging to the wing of the other cherub.

\ts\*
\v 13 The wings of these cherubim spread out 20 cubits. And they were standing on their feet, and their faces toward the house.
\v 14 And he made the curtain of violet, and purple, and crimson and fine linen, and he brought up on it cherubim.

\ts\*
\p
\v 15 And he made before the house two pillars, 35 cubits in length; and the capital which was on its head, five cubits.
\v 16 And he made chains in the inner sanctuary, and he placed on the head of the pillars; and he made 100 pomegranates and he placed on the chains.
\v 17 And he set up the pillars on the face of the temple, one on the right hand, and one on the left. And he called the name of the right, Jakin, and the name of the left, Boaz.


\ts\*

\c 4
\p
\v 1 And he made an altar of bronze, 20 cubits its length, and 20 cubits its width, and 10 cubits its height.
\v 2 And he made the Sea of cast metal, 10 by the cubit from its edge to its edge, round, all around, and 5 by the cubit its height; and a measuring string 30 by the cubit surrounding it all around.
\v 3 And a likeness of oxen was under it all around; all around, surrounding it, 10 cubits, encircling the Sea all around; two rows of the oxen, cast in its cast metal.

\ts\*
\v 4 Standing on 12 oxen, three turned to the north, and 3 turned to the west, and 3 turned to the south, and three turned to the east. And the Sea was on them above, and all their hindquarters to the house.
\v 5 And its thickness was a span, and its edge like a work of an edge of a cup, a bud of a lily, taking hold, 3000 baths it could contain.
\v 6 And he made 10 pots, and he placed five on the right and five on the left to wash in them; the work of the burnt offering, they will rinse in them. And the Sea for bathing for the priests in it.

\ts\*
\p
\v 7 And he made the 10 lampstands of gold according to their judgment, and he placed in the temple five on the right and five on the left.
\v 8 And he made 10 tables, and he gave rest in the temple, five on the right, and five on the left. And he made 100 basins of gold.

\ts\*
\v 9 And he made the courtyard of the priests, and the great court and the doors for the court and their doors he overlaid with bronze.
\v 10 And the Sea he placed on the right side to the east, facing toward the south.

\ts\*
\v 11 And Huram made the tubs, and the shovels, and the basins.
\p
And Huram finished making the work that he made for King Solomon in the house of God:
\v 12 the two pillars, and the bowls, and the capitals on the head of the two pillars, and the two trellises to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the head of the pillars,
\v 13 and the 400 pomegranates for the two trellises, two rows of pomegranates for each trellis to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the face of the pillars.

\ts\*
\v 14 And the stands he made, and the pots he made on the stands,

\ts\*
\v 17 In the vicinity of the Jordan the king cast them, in the thick ground between Succoth and between Zeredathah.
\v 18 And Solomon made all these items in great abundance; indeed, the weight of the bronze was not sought out.

\ts\*
\p
\v 19 And Solomon made all the items that were in the house of God, and the altar of gold, and the tables and on them the bread of the presence;
\v 20 and the lampstands and their lamps for their burning according to the judgment before the inner sanctuary, fine gold;
\v 21 and the buds, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold, it was perfection of gold.

\c 5
\p
\v 1 And all the work which Solomon did for the house of Yahweh was completed, and Solomon brought in the sacred things of David, his father; and the silver, and the gold, and all the items, he placed in the treasuries of the house of God.

\ts\*
\p
\v 2 Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads of the tribes, the leaders of the fathers of the sons of Israel to Jerusalem, to bring up the Box of the covenant of Yahweh from the city of David, that is, Zion.
\v 3 And all the men of Israel assembled to the king at the feast; it was the seventh month.

\ts\*
\v 4 And all the elders of Israel came, and the Levites carried the Box.
\v 5 And they brought up the Box, and the tent of meeting, and all the sacred items that were in the tent; the priests, the Levites, brought them up.
\v 6 And King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel were gathering to him before the Box, sacrificing sheep and oxen which was not counted, and it was not numbered because of the abundance.

\ts\*
\v 7 And the priests brought in the Box of the covenant of Yahweh to its place, to the inner sanctuary of the house, to the holy of holies, to under the wings of the cherubim.
\v 8 And the cherubim were spreading out wings over the place of the Box. And the cherubim covered over the Box and over its poles from above.

\ts\*
\v 9 And the poles lengthened and the heads of the poles from the Box were seen at the front of the inner sanctuary, but they were not seen outside. And they are there until this day.
\v 10 There was nothing in the Box except the two tablets that Moses had placed at Horeb, which Yahweh cut with the sons of Israel in their going out from Egypt.

\ts\*
\p
\v 11 And it happened in the going out of the priests from the holy place that all the priests who were found consecrated themselves; there was no keeping to the divisions.
\v 12 And the Levites, the singers, all of them, Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and their brothers, clothed in fine linen, with cymbals, and with harps and lyres, were standing to the east of the altar. And with them, 120 priests sounding with trumpets.

\ts\*
\v 13 And it happened, like one were the trumpeters and singers, to cause to hear one voice to praise and to give thanks to Yahweh. And when raising a voice with trumpets and with cymbals and with the items of the song, and when praising Yahweh: “For good, for forever is his covenant faithfulness.” And the house filled with a cloud, the house of Yahweh.
\v 14 And the priests were not able to stand to minister because of the cloud, for the glory of Yahweh filled the house of God.


\ts\*

\c 6
\p
\v 1 Then Solomon said, “Yahweh has said he would dwell in thick darkness,
\v 2 but I have built a lofty house for you and a place for you to dwell forever.”
\v 3 And the king turned his face, and he blessed all the assembly of Israel, and all the assembly of Israel was standing.

\ts\*
\p
\v 4 And he said, “Blessed be Yahweh the God of Israel who spoke with his mouth to David my father, and with his hands he fulfilled, saying,
\v 5 ‘From the day that I brought out my people from the land of Egypt, I did not choose a city from all the tribes of Israel to build a house, for my name to be there. And I did not choose a man to be leader over my people Israel.
\v 6 But I have chosen Jerusalem, for my name to be there, and I have chosen David to be over my people Israel.’

\ts\*
\v 7 And it was with the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel.
\v 8 And Yahweh said to David my father, ‘On account of what is with your heart to build a house for my name, you did well that it was with your heart.
\v 9 Only you yourself must not build the house; instead, your son who comes from your loins, he himself will build the house for my name.’

\ts\*
\v 10 And Yahweh has established his word that he spoke, and I have risen instead of David my father, and I sit on the throne of Israel, just as Yahweh spoke. And I have built the house for the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel.
\v 11 And I set there the Box, in which there is the covenant of Yahweh, which he cut with the sons of Israel.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 12 And he stood before the altar of Yahweh in front of all the assembly of Israel. And he spread out his hands,
\v 13 for Solomon made a platform of bronze, and he placed it in the midst of the court, five cubits its length, and five cubits its width, and three cubits its height. And he stood on it, and he knelt down on his knees in front of all the assembly of Israel, and he spread out his hands to the heavens.


\ts\*
\v 14 And he said, “Yahweh, God of Israel, there is not like you a god in the heavens or on the earth, one who keeps the covenant and covenant faithfulness to your servants, walking before you with all their heart;
\v 15 who kept for your servant David my father that which he spoke to him. And you spoke with your mouth and by your hand you have fulfilled, like this day.

\ts\*
\v 16 And now, Yahweh, God of Israel, keep for your servant David my father that which you spoke to him saying, ‘There will not be cut off for you a man from before me, sitting on the throne of Israel, only if your sons keep their ways to walk in my law, just as you walked before me.’
\v 17 And now, Yahweh, God of Israel, let your word be confirmed, which you spoke to your servant, to David.

\ts\*
\p
\v 18 But will God indeed dwell with mankind on the earth? Behold, the heavens and the heavens of the heavens do not contain you—how much less this house that I have built!
\v 19 Yet turn to the prayer of your servant and to his supplication, Yahweh my God, to listen to the cry and to the prayer that your servant is praying before you,
\v 20 your eyes to be open to this house days and night, to the place where you said to put your name there, to listen to the prayer which your servant prays toward this place.

\ts\*
\v 21 And listen to the supplications of your servant and your people Israel when they pray toward this place, and you yourself hear from the place of your dwelling from the heavens, and hear and forgive.

\ts\*
\p
\v 22 If a man sins against his neighbor and is made by him to swear an oath, and brings an oath before your altar in this house,
\v 23 then you yourself hear from the heavens, and act, and judge your servants, to bring back the wicked, to put his way on his head, and to make righteous the righteous, to give to him according to his righteousness.

\ts\*
\p
\v 24 And if your people Israel are struck down before an enemy because they have sinned against you, and they return, and they confess your name, and they pray, and they seek favor before you in this house,
\v 25 then you yourself hear from the heavens and forgive the sin of your people Israel, and bring them back to the ground that you gave to them and to their fathers.

\ts\*
\p
\v 26 When the heavens are restrained and there is no rain because they have sinned against you, and they pray toward this place, and they confess your name, from their sin they turn for you afflict them,
\v 27 then you yourself hear in the heavens and forgive the sin of your servants and your people Israel, for you teach them the good way in which they should walk in it. And give rain on your land, which you gave to your people for a possession.

\ts\*
\p
\v 28 Famine, if there is, in the land pestilence, if there is blight or mildew, locust or grasshopper, if there is indeed they suffer distress from their enemies in the land at the gates, any plague or any sickness,
\v 29 any prayer, any supplication which is by any person or by all your people Israel which they know each his own plague and his own sorrow, and he spreads out his hands toward this house,
\v 30 then you yourself hear from the heavens, your dwelling place, and forgive, and give to each according to all his ways; because you know his heart, for you yourself, only you, know the heart of the sons of mankind,
\v 31 in order that they may fear you, by walking in your ways all the days that they live on the face of the ground that you gave to our fathers.

\ts\*
\p
\v 32 And also to the foreigner who is not from your people Israel, and he comes from a distant land because of your great name, and your strong hand, and your outstretched arm, and they come and pray toward this house,
\v 33 and you yourself hear from the heavens, from your dwelling place, and do according to all that the foreigner calls to you, so that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you, like your people Israel, and to know that your name is called toward this house that I have built.

\ts\*
\p
\v 34 When your people go out to battle against their enemies in the way which you send them, and they pray to you toward the way of this city that you have chosen it and the house that I have built for your name,
\v 35 then hear from the heavens their prayer, and their supplication, and do their judgment.

\ts\*
\p
\v 36 When they sin against you—for there is no person who does not sin—and you are angry with them and give them before an enemy, and their captors take them captive, to a land, distant or near,
\v 37 and they turn back their heart in the land where they are captive there, and they turn and they seek favor from you in the land of their captivity, saying, ‘We have sinned; we have committed iniquity, and we have done evil,’
\v 38 and they turn to you with all their heart and with all their being in the land of their captivity, where they took them captive, and they pray toward the way of their land which you gave to their fathers, and the city that you chose, and toward the house that I have built for your name,
\v 39 then hear from the heavens, from your dwelling place, their prayer and their supplication, and do their judgment, and forgive your people who sinned against you.

\ts\*
\p
\v 40 Now, my God, please let your eyes be open, and your ears attentive to the prayer of this place.
\v 41 And now arise, Yahweh God, to your resting place, you and the Box of your strength. Your priests, Yahweh God, may they be clothed in salvation, and your faithful ones rejoice in goodness.
\v 42 Yahweh God, do not turn away the face of your anointed ones. Remember the covenant faithfulnesses of David your servant.”

\p
\v 1 And when Solomon finished praying, then the fire came down from the heavens and consumed the burnt offering and the sacrifices, and the glory of Yahweh filled the house.
\v 2 And the priests were not able to go into the house of Yahweh because the glory of Yahweh filled the house of Yahweh.
\v 3 And all the sons of Israel were seeing the fire come down and the glory of Yahweh on the house, and they bowed down their faces to the ground on the stone pavement, and they worshiped and gave thanks to Yahweh, “Truly he is good; truly his covenant faithfulness is forever.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 4 And the king and all the people were offering sacrifice before Yahweh.
\v 5 And King Solomon offered a sacrifice of 22, 000 oxen and 120, 000 sheep. And the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.
\v 6 And the priests at their posts were standing; and the Levites with instruments of song of Yahweh which David the king had made to give thanks to Yahweh, “For his covenant faithfulness is forever,” when David praised by the hand of them. And the priests were trumpeting in front of them, and all Israel was standing.

\ts\*
\v 7 And Solomon consecrated the middle of the courtyard which is before the house of Yahweh. For he did there the burnt offerings and the fat of the peace offerings because the bronze altar which Solomon made was not able to contain the burnt offerings, and the grain offering, and the fats.

\ts\*
\p
\v 8 And Solomon did the feast at that time, seven days, and all Israel with him, a very great assembly, from Lebo Hamath to the brook of Egypt.
\v 9 And they did on the eighth day an assembly, for the dedication of the altar they did, seven days, and the feast, seven days.
\v 10 And on the 23 rd day of the seventh month, he sent away the people to their tents joyful and good of heart on account of the goodness which Yahweh did for David, and for Solomon, and for Israel his people.

\ts\*
\p
\v 11 And Solomon finished the house of Yahweh and the house of the king. And all that came into the heart of Solomon to do in the house of Yahweh and in his house, he succeeded.
\v 12 And Yahweh appeared to Solomon in the night, and he said to him, “I have heard your prayer, and I have chosen this place for myself for a house of sacrifice.

\ts\*
\v 13 If I restrain the heavens and there is no rain, or if I command the locust to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my people,
\v 14 and my people, whom my name is called over them, humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn back from their evil ways, then I myself will hear from the heavens, and I will forgive their sin, and I will heal their land.
\v 15 Now my eyes will be open and my ears attentive to the prayer of this place.

\ts\*
\v 16 And now I have chosen and I have consecrated this house for my name to be there until forever. And my eyes and my heart will be there all the days.
\v 17 And you, if you walk before me just as David your father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded you, and my statutes and my judgments you keep,
\v 18 then I will establish the throne of your kingdom, just as I cut with David your father, saying, ‘There will not be cut off from you a man ruling in Israel.’

\ts\*
\p
\v 19 But if you all turn yourselves, and forsake my statutes and my commandments which I placed before you all, and walk and serve other gods and worship them,
\v 20 then I will remove them from upon my ground which I gave to them. And this house which I consecrated for my name, I will cast out from before my face, and I will make it a proverb and a taunt among all the peoples.

\ts\*
\v 21 And this house which was exalted to all who pass by it will be devastated, and they will say, ‘Why did Yahweh do thus to this land and to this house?’
\v 22 And they will say, ‘On account of which they forsook Yahweh, the God of their fathers who brought them out from the land of Egypt, and they laid hold of other gods and worshipped them and served them. On account of thus, he brought on them all this misery.’”

\p
\v 1 And it happened at the end of 20 years, in which Solomon built the house of Yahweh and his house,
\v 2 and the cities which Huram gave to Solomon, Solomon built them. And he caused to dwell there the sons of Israel.

\ts\*
\p
\v 3 And Solomon went to Hamathzobah and he prevailed over it.
\v 4 And he built Tadmor in the wilderness and all the cities of stores which he built in Hamath.

\ts\*
\v 5 And he built Beth Horon the Upper and Beth Horon the Lower, fortified cities with walls, doors, and a bar,
\v 6 and Baalath and all the cities of stores which were to Solomon, and all the cities of the chariots and the cities of the horsemen, and all the desire of Solomon which he desired to build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his kingdom.

\ts\*
\p
\v 7 All the people who were left from the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not from Israel,
\v 8 from their sons who were left after them in the land, whom the sons of Israel had not brought to an end—and Solomon brought them up for forced laborers, until this day.

\ts\*
\v 9 But, from the sons of Israel which Solomon did not make to be laborers for his work, rather, they were men of battle, and chiefs of his officers, and chiefs of his chariots and his horsemen.
\v 10 and these, the chiefs of supervisors who were to King Solomon, 250 ruling over the people.

\ts\*
\p
\v 11 And the daughter of Pharaoh Solomon brought up from the city of David to the house that he built for her, for he said, “My wife must not dwell in the house of David, the king of Israel, because sacred are the places where the Box of Yahweh has come into them.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 12 Then Solomon brought up burnt offerings to Yahweh on the altar of Yahweh that he had built before the porch.
\v 13 And by the matter day by day to bring up, according to the commandment of Moses, for the Sabbaths, and for the new moons, and for the appointed times three times in the year: at the Feast of Unleavened Bread, and at the Feast of Weeks, and at the Feast of Booths.

\ts\*

\v 10 And the young men who had grown with him spoke, saying, “Thus you shall say to the people who spoke to you, saying ‘Your father made our yoke heavy, but you yourself lighten from on us.’ Thus you shall say to them, ‘My little finger is thicker than the loins of my father.

\v 16 And all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, and the people answered the king, saying, “What for us is a portion with David? And no inheritance with the son of Jesse. Each to your tents, Israel! Now, see your house, David.” And all Israel went to his tents.

\v 2 But the word of Yahweh was to Shemaiah the man of God, saying,

\v 5 And Rehoboam dwelled in Jerusalem, and he built cities for fortification in Judah.

\v 11 And he strengthened the fortifications. And he placed in them leaders and storehouses of food and oil and wine,

\ts\*
\p
\v 13 And the priests and the Levites who were in all Israel presented themselves to him from all their territories.
\v 14 For the Levites left their open lands and their property. And they went to Judah and to Jerusalem, for Jeroboam and his sons rejected them from serving as priests to Yahweh.
\v 15 And he established for himself priests for the high places and for the goats and for the calves which he had made.

\ts\*
\v 16 And after them from all the tribes of Israel, the ones giving their heart to seek Yahweh, the God of Israel, came to Jerusalem to sacrifice to Yahweh, the God of their fathers.
\v 17 And they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and they made Rehoboam the son of Solomon strong for three years, for they walked in the way of David and Solomon for three years.

\ts\*
\p
\v 18 And Rehoboam took for himself a wife: Mahalath, the daughter of Jerimoth, the son of David, Abihail, the daughter of Eliab, the son of Jesse.
\v 19 And she bore to him sons: Jeush, and Shemariah, and Zaham.

\ts\*
\v 20 And after her, he took Maacah, the daughter of Absalom; and she bore to him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.
\v 21 And Rehoboam loved Maacah, the daughter of Absalom, more than all his wives and his concubines, for he lifted 18 wives and 60 concubines, and he fathered 28 sons and 60 daughters.

\ts\*
\v 22 And Rehoboam appointed to be head Abijah the son of Maacah, to be leader among his brothers; for he caused to make him king.
\v 23 And he dealt wisely, and he scattered all his sons to all the lands of Judah and Benjamin to all the fortified cities. And he gave to them provisions in abundance, and he asked for a multitude of wives.

\v 1 And it happened when the reign of Rehoboam was established and when he had become strong, he abandoned the law of Yahweh—and all Israel with him.

\v 2 And it happened in the fifth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak, the king of Egypt, came up against Jerusalem, because they were unfaithful to Yahweh.
\v 3 With 1200 chariots, and 60, 000 horsemen, and there was no number for the people who came with him from Egypt: Libyans, Sukkites, and Cushites.
\v 4 And he captured the fortified cities that belonged to Judah, and he came to Jerusalem.

\ts\*
\v 5 And Shemaiah the prophet came to Rehoboam and the chiefs of Judah who had gathered to Jerusalem because of Shishak. And he said to them, “Thus says Yahweh: You all yourselves have abandoned me, and I myself have also abandoned you all into the hand of Shishak.”
\v 6 And the chiefs of Israel and the king humbled themselves. And they said, “Righteous is Yahweh.”

\ts\*
\v 7 And when Yahweh saw that they had humbled themselves, the word of Yahweh was to Shemaiah, saying, “They have humbled themselves. I will not destroy them; and I will give to them like a little for escape, and my rage will not pour out on Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.
\v 8 Nevertheless, they will be to him for servants, and they will know my service and the service of the kingdoms of the lands.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 9 And Shishak, the king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem and took the treasures of the house of Yahweh and the treasures of the house of the king. Everything he took; and he took the shields of gold that Solomon had made.
\v 10 And King Rehoboam made in their place shields of bronze, and he appointed over the hand of the chiefs of the runners, the keepers of the entrance of the house of the king.

\ts\*
\v 11 And it happened as often as the king came into the house of Yahweh, the runners came and carried them and brought them back to the chamber of the runners.
\v 12 And when he humbled himself, the anger of Yahweh turned from him, and did not destroy to completion. And also, in Judah there were good matters.

\v 13 And King Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and he reigned. For a son of 41 years Rehoboam was in his reigning, and 17 years he reigned in Jerusalem, the city that Yahweh had chosen to put his name there from all the tribes of Israel. And the name of his mother, Naamah the Ammonitess.
\v 14 And he did evil, for he did not establish his heart to seek Yahweh.

\ts\*

\v 15 And the matters of Rehoboam, the first things and the last things, are they not written in the words of Shemaiah the prophet and Iddo the seer, according to genealogy? And there were wars between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days.

\v 1 In the 18 th year of King Jeroboam, then Abijah reigned over Judah.
\v 2 Three years he reigned in Jerusalem. And the name of his mother, Macaiah, the daughter of Uriel from Gibeah. And war was between Abijah and between Jeroboam.
\v 3 And Abijah began the battle with an army of mighty ones of battle, 400, 000 chosen men. And Jeroboam deployed against him in battle 800, 000 chosen men, mighty ones of strength.

\ts\*
\v 4 And Abijah rose on Mount Zemaraim, which is in the hills of Ephraim, and he said, “Hear me, Jeroboam and all Israel!
\v 5 Is it not to you all to know that Yahweh, the God of Israel, gave the kingdom to David over Israel forever, to him and to his sons, a covenant of salt?

\ts\*
\v 6 But Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon, the son of David, arose, and he rebelled against his lord.
\v 7 And empty men, sons of wickedness, assembled about him, and they strenghtened themselves over Rehoboam, the son of Solomon. And Rehoboam was young and tender of heart, and he did not strengthen himself before them.

\ts\*
\v 8 And now, you all are saying to strengthen self before the kingdom of Yahweh, by the hand of the sons of David, and you all are a great abundance, and with you all are calves of gold which Jeroboam made for you all for gods.
\v 9 Did you all not drive out the priests of Yahweh, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, and make for yourselves priests like the peoples of the lands? Any who comes to fill his hand with a young bull, a son of a herd, and seven rams, and he will be a priest of what are not gods.

\ts\*
\v 10 But us, Yahweh is our God, and we have not abandoned him. And priests, are ministering to Yahweh, the sons of Aaron, and the Levites, in the work.
\v 11 And they are making sacrifices to Yahweh, burnt offerings, morning by morning and evening by evening, and spiced incense, and a line of bread on the pure table, and the gold lampstand and its lamps to burn evening by evening. For we are keeping the charge of Yahweh, our God, but you all yourselves have abandoned him.

\ts\*
\v 12 And behold, with us, at our head, is God, and his priests and the trumpets of shouting to raise a shout against you all. Sons of Israel, do not fight against Yahweh, the God of your fathers, for you will not succeed.”

\p
\v 13 But Jeroboam had caused to circle around an ambush to come from behind them; and they were before Judah, and the ambush from behind them.
\v 14 And Judah turned, and behold, to them was the battle before them and behind. And they cried out to Yahweh, and the priests were blowing trumpets.
\v 15 And the men of Judah raised a shout; and it happened when the men of Judah raised a shout, then God struck Jeroboam and all Israel before Abijah and Judah.

\ts\*
\v 16 And the sons of Israel fled from before Judah, and God gave them into their hand.
\v 17 And Abijah and his people struck them a great striking, and they fell slain from Israel, 500, 000 chosen men.
\v 18 And the sons of Israel were humbled at that time, and the sons of Judah were strong because they relied on Yahweh, the God of their fathers.

\ts\*
\v 19 And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam; and he captured from him cities: Bethel and its daughters, and Jeshanah and its daughters, and Ephron and its daughters.
\v 20 And the strength of Jeroboam did not hold again in the days of Abijah; and Yahweh struck him down, and he died.
\v 21 And Abijah strengthened himself; and he lifted to himself 14 wives, and he fatherered 22 sons and 16 daughters.
\v 22 And the remainder of the matters of Abijah, and his ways, and his words are written in the writing of the prophet Iddo.

\v 1 And Abijah lied down with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David. And Asa, his son, reigned in his place. In his days the land was quiet ten years.
\v 2 And Asa did the good and the right in the eyes of Yahweh his God.
\v 3 And he took away the foreign altars and the high places, and he shattered the pillars, and he cut to pieces the Asherim.
\v 4 And he said to Judah to seek Yahweh, the God of their fathers, and to do the law and the commandment.


\ts\*
\v 5 And he took away from all the cities of Judah the high places and the incense altars. And the kingdom was quiet before him.
\v 6 And he built fortified cities in Judah, for the land was quiet. And there was not with him war in these years, because Yahweh had given rest to him.

\ts\*
\v 7 And he said to Judah, “Let us build these cities and let us surround with a wall, and towers, doors, and bars; still the land is before us because we have sought Yahweh our God. We have sought, and he has given rest to us all around.” And they built, and they succeeded.
\v 8 And there was to Asa an army carrying large shield and spear; from Judah, 300, 000. And from Benjamin, ones carrying shield and drawing bow, 280, 000. All these were mighty ones of strength.

\v 9 And Zerah the Cushite came out against them with an army of 1, 000 thousands and 300 chariots; and he came to Mareshah.
\v 10 And Asa went out before him, and they deployed for battle in the Valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.
\v 11 And Asa called to Yahweh his God and said, “Yahweh, it is nothing for you to help between many and one without strength. Help us, Yahweh our God, for on you we rely, and in your name we have come against this multitude. Yahweh, our God you are; do not let man prevail against you.”

\ts\*
\v 12 And Yahweh struck down the Cushites before Asa and before Judah; and the Cushites fled.
\v 13 And Asa and the people who were with him pursued them until Gerar. And there fell from the Cushites so that there was none to them something living; for they were broken before Yahweh and before his camp. And they carried away very much plunder.

\ts\*
\v 14 And they struck all the cities around Gerar, for the dread of Yahweh was on them. And they plundered all the cities, for great spoils was in them.

\v 1 And Azariah the son of Oded, on him came the Spirit of God.

\ts\*
\v 3 And many days were to Israel without the true God, and without a priest teaching, and without the law.
\v 4 But they turned in their distress to Yahweh, the God of Israel, and they sought him, and he was found by them.

\v 6 And they were beaten down, nation by nation, and city by city, for God confused them in all distress.
\v 7 But you all, be strong, and do not let your hands grow slack, for there is reward for your work.”

\v 8 And when Asa heard these words and the prophecy of Oded the prophet, he strengthened himself and caused to pass away the abhorrences from all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and from the cities that he had captured from the hill country of Ephraim. And he restored the altar of Yahweh which was before the porch of Yahweh.
\v 9 And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the sojourners with them from Ephraim and Manasseh, and from Simeon; for they fell on him from Israel in abundance when they saw that Yahweh his God was with him.

\v 10 And they gathered at Jerusalem in the third month, in the 15 th year of the reign of Asa.

\v 12 And they entered into a covenant to seek Yahweh, the God of their fathers, with all their heart and with all their being.
\v 13 And any who does not seek Yahweh, the God of Israel, will be killed, whether small or great, whether man or woman.

\ts\*
\v 14 And they swore to Yahweh with a great voice, and with a shout, and with trumpets and with horns.
\v 15 And all Judah rejoiced about the oath, for with all their heart they swore, and with all their will they sought him, and he was found by them. And Yahweh gave rest to them all around.

\ts\*
\p
\v 16 And also Maacah, the mother of King Asa, he took her away from being queen, because she made to Asherah an abominable image. And Asa cut down her abominable image, and crushed and burned at the brook Kidron.
\v 17 But the high places they did not take away from Israel. Nevertheless, the heart of Asa was undivided all his days.

\v 2 And Asa brought silver and gold from the treasuries of the house of Yahweh and the house of the king. And he sent to Ben Hadad, the king of Aram, who was dwelling in Damascus, saying,
\v 3 “A covenant between me and between you, and between my father and between your father. Behold, I have sent to you silver and gold. Go, break your covenant with Baasha, the king of Israel, and he will go up from against me.”

\v 6 And King Asa took all Judah. And they carried away the stones of Ramah and its wood with which Baasha had been building, and he built with them Geba and Mizpah.


\ts\*
\p
\v 7 And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa, the king of Judah, and he said to him, “Because you relied on the king of Aram, and you did not rely on Yahweh your God, therefore the army of the king of Aram escaped from your hand.
\v 8 Were not the Cushites and the Lubites an abundant army with very many chariots and horsemen? Yet, because you relied on Yahweh, he gave them into your hand.

\ts\*
\v 9 For Yahweh, his eyes, are going quickly in all the earth to strengthen himself with their heart undivided to him. You have acted foolishly regarding this. For from now, there will be with you wars.”
\v 10 And Asa was angry at the seer; and he put him in the house of the stocks, for in rage with him regarding this. And Asa oppressed some of the people at that time.

\ts\*
\v 13 And Asa lied down with his fathers, and he died in the 41 st year of his reign.

\v 2 And he went down at the end of years to Ahab in Samaria, and Ahab sacrificed for him sheep and oxen in abundance and for the people who were with him. And he incited him to go up against Ramoth Gilead.
\v 3 And Ahab, the king of Israel, said to Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, “Will you go with me to Ramoth Gilead?” And he said to him, “Like me, like you, and like your people, my people, and with you in battle.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 4 And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, “Please seek as the day the word of Yahweh.”
\v 5 And the king of Israel gathered the prophets, 400 men. And he said to them, “Should we go against Ramoth Gilead in battle, or should I refrain?” And they said, “Go up, and God will give into the hand of the king.”

\ts\*
\v 6 And Jehoshaphat said, “Is there not here another prophet of Yahweh, that we might seek from him?”
\v 7 And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Still one man to seek Yahweh from him. But I myself hate him for nothing does he prophesy about me that is good, but all his days evil. He is Micaiah the son of Imlah.” And Jehoshaphat said, “Let not the king say thus.”
\v 8 And the king of Israel called to one officer, and he said, “Hasten Micaiah the son of Imlah.”

\ts\*
\v 9 And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting, each on his throne, clothed with robes. And they were sitting at a threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria, and all the prophets were prophesying before them.
\v 10 And Zedekiah the son of Kenaanah made for himself horns of iron, and he said, “Thus says Yahweh: With these you will gore Aram until they are finished.”
\v 11 And all the prophets were prophesying thus, saying, “Go up to Ramoth Gilead and succeed. And Yahweh will give into the hand of the king.”

\ts\*

\v 12 And the messenger who went to call Micaiah spoke to him, saying, “Behold, the words of the prophets, one mouth, good to the king. And please let your word be as one from them, and speak good.”
\v 13 And Micaiah said, “As Yahweh lives, surely that which my God says, it I will speak.”
\v 14 And he came to the king, and the king said to him, “Micaiah, should we go against Ramoth Gilead for battle, or should I refrain?” And he said, “Go up and succeed. And they will be given into your hand.”

\ts\*
\v 15 And the king said to him, “How many times must I myself make you swear that you will speak not to me, only truth in the name of Yahweh?”
\v 16 And he said, “I saw all Israel scattered on the hills, like sheep which do not have to them one who shepherds. And Yahweh said, ‘No master to these; they will turn, each to his house in peace.’”

\ts\*
\v 17 And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “Did I not say to you, he will not prophesy about me good, but only evil?”
\v 18 And he said, “Therefore, hear the word of Yahweh: I saw Yahweh sitting on his throne and all the host of heaven standing on his right and his left.

\ts\*
\v 19 And Yahweh said, ‘Who will entice Ahab, the king of Israel, so he will go up, and he will fall at Ramoth Gilead?’ And this speaker said thus, and this speaker thus.

\v 20 And the spirit went out, and he stood before Yahweh. And he said, ‘I myself will entice him.’ And Yahweh said to him, ‘With what?’
\v 21 And he said, ‘I will go out and I will become a spirit of deception in the mouth of all his prophets.’ And he said, ‘You will entice, and also you will be able. Go out and do thus.’

\ts\*
\v 22 And now, behold, Yahweh placed a spirit of deception in the mouth of these your prophets, and Yahweh, he has spoken against you disaster.”

\v 23 And Zedekiah the son of Kenaanah, drew near, and he struck Micaiah on the cheek. And he said, “Where is this, the way the Spirit of Yahweh passed over from me to speak with you?”
\v 24 And Micaiah said, “Behold, you will see on that day, when you go chamber by chamber to hide yourself.”

\ts\*
\v 25 And the king of Israel said, “Take Micaiah and return him to Amon, the chief of the city, and to Joash, the son of the king,
\v 26 and say, ‘Thus says the king: Put this in the house of imprisonment and feed him bread of oppression and water of oppression, until my returning in peace.’”
\v 27 And Micaiah said, “If you certainly return in peace, Yahweh did not speak with me.” And he said, “Hear, O peoples, all of them!”

\ts\*

\v 28 And the king of Israel went up, and Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, against Ramoth Gilead.
\v 29 And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, “I will disguise myself and go into the battle, and now put on your garments.” And the king of Israel disguised himself, and they went into the battle.
\v 30 And the king of Aram had commanded the chiefs of the chariots which were to him, saying, “Do not fight the small or the great, but with the king of Israel alone.”

\ts\*
\v 31 And it happened when the chiefs of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, and they said, “It is the king of Israel.” And they turned against him to fight. And Jehoshaphat cried out, and Yahweh helped him, and God incited them from him.
\v 32 And it happened when the chiefs of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, and they turned back from after him.

\ts\*
\v 33 And a man drew the bow in his innocence and struck the king of Israel between the joinings and between the armor. And he said to the charioteer, “Turn your hand and bring me out from the camp, for I have been seriously wounded.”

\v 1 And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in peace, to Jerusalem.
\v 2 But Jehu, the son of Hanani the seer, went out to his face, and he said to King Jehoshaphat, “Should the wicked you help and the ones who hate Yahweh you love? And because of this, upon you is wrath from before Yahweh.
\v 3 However, good things have been found with you, for you removed the Asherah from the land, and you established your heart to seek God.”

\v 10 And any dispute that comes to you all from your brothers, the ones dwelling in their cities, between blood to blood, between law to command, to statutes, and to judgments, and you all must caution them, so they will not be guilty to Yahweh, and there will be wrath on you all and on your brothers.

\v 11 Also, he himself made the high places in the hills of Judah, and he caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit adultery, and he drove Judah away.

And they made items for the house of Yahweh, items of ministry and of burnt offerings and pans and items of gold and silver. And they were offering up burnt offerings at the house of Yahweh regularly all the days of Jehoiada.

\v 15 And Jehoiada grew old and was full of days, and he died, a son of 130 years at his death.
\v 16 And they buried him in the city of David with the kings, because he did good in Israel and toward God and his house.

\ts\*
\v 17 And after the death of Jehoiada, the chiefs of Judah came and bowed down to the king. Then the king listened to them.
\v 18 And they abandoned the house of Yahweh, the God of their fathers, and they served the Asherim and the idols. And there was wrath on Judah and Jerusalem on account of this, their guilt.
\v 19 And he sent among them prophets to bring them back to Yahweh. And they testified against them, but they did not listen.

\ts\*
\p
\v 20 And the Spirit of God clothed Zechariah the son of Jehoiada the priest. And he stood above the people, and he said to them, “Thus says God: Why are you passing over the commands of Yahweh, and you do not prosper? Because you all abandoned Yahweh, then he has abandoned you all.”
\v 21 But they conspired against him, and they stoned him with stones by the command of the king in the court of the house of Yahweh.
\v 22 And King Joash did not remember the covenant faithfulness that Jehoiada, his father did with him, and he killed his son. And when he died, he said, “May Yahweh see and seek.”

\p
\v 23 And it happened at the turn of the year, the army of Aram came up against him, and they came to Judah and Jerusalem. And they destroyed all the chiefs of the people from the people. And all the plunder they sent to the king of Damascus.
\v 24 Indeed with a small amount of men the army of Aram came, yet Yahweh gave into their hand a very large army because they abandoned Yahweh, the God of their fathers. And they did judgment on Joash.

\ts\*
\p
\v 25 And when they went from him, for they left him with many wounds, his servants conspired against him on account of the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest. And they killed him on his bed, and he died. And they buried him in the city of David, but they did not bury him in the graves of the kings.
\v 26 And these were the ones who conspired against him: Zabad the son of Shimeath, the Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith, the Moabitess.

\v 2 And he did what was right in the eyes of Yahweh, only not with a complete heart.

\ts\*
\v 3 And it happended when the kingdom was strong upon him, then he killed his servants, the ones who struck down the king, his father.
\v 4 But their sons he did not put to death for as it is written in the law, in the scroll of Moses, whom Yahweh commanded saying, “Fathers must not die on account of their sons, and sons must not die on account of their fathers, but each for his sin, they must die.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 5 And Amaziah gathered Judah, and he appointed them according to the house of the fathers, for chiefs of thousands and for chiefs of hundreds for all of Judah and Benjamin. And he mustered them from a son of 20 years and upward. And he found them, 300, 000 chosen, going out to war grasping spear and large shield.
\v 6 And he hired from Israel 100, 000 mighty ones of strength for 100 talents of silver.

\ts\*
\v 7 But a man of God came to him, saying, “O King, do not let the army of Israel go with you, for Yahweh is not with Israel, all the sons of Ephraim.
\v 8 But if you go, act, be strong in battle; God will cause you to fall before the enemy, for there is power in God to help and to cause to fall.”

\ts\*
\v 9 And Amaziah said to the man of God, “And what will we do with the 100 talents that I have given to the troop of Israel?” And the man of God said, “There is to Yahweh to give to you much more than this.”
\v 10 And Amaziah separated them, the troop that had come to him from Ephraim to go to their place. And their anger burned greatly against Judah, and they returned to their place in the burning of anger.

\ts\*
\v 11 And Amaziah, he strengthened himself, and he led out his people. And he went to the Valley of Salt. And he struck down the sons of Seir, 10, 000.
\v 12 And 10, 000 alive the sons of Judah took captive. And they brought them to the head of the cliff, and they threw them from the head of the cliff. And all of them were dashed to pieces.

\ts\*
\v 13 But the sons of the troop that Amaziah sent back from going with him to battle, and they raided against the cities of Judah from Samaria and until Beth Horon. And they struck down from them 3, 000 and they plundered much plunder.

\ts\*
\p
\v 14 And it happened after Amaziah had come from striking the Edomites, and he brought the gods of the sons of Seir, and set them up for himself to be gods. And before them he bowed down and to them he made sacrifices.
\v 15 And the anger of Yahweh burned against Amaziah. And he sent to him a prophet, and he said to him, “Why do you seek the gods of the people who did not deliver their people from your hand?”
\ts\*
\v 16 And it happened when he was speaking with him, and he said to him, “For a counselor to the king have we placed you? Stop yourself! Why should they strike you down?” And the prophet stopped. And he said, “I know that God has counselled to destroy you because you have done this and you did not listen to my counsel.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 17 And Amaziah, the king of Judah, took counsel and sent to Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, the king of Israel, saying, “Come, let us meet each other face to face.”

\ts\*
\v 18 And Joash the king of Israel sent to Amaziah, the king of Judah, saying, “A bramble that was in Lebanon sent to a cedar that was in Lebanon, saying, ‘Give your daughter to my son for a wife,’ but an animal passed over the field that was in Lebanon and trampled the bramble.
\v 19 You have said, Behold, you have struck down Edom, and your heart has lifted you to boast. Now, sit in your house. Why excite yourself in evil and fall, you and Judah with you?”

\ts\*
\p
\v 20 But Amaziah did not listen, because from God it was, in order to give them into the hand because they sought the gods of Edom.
\v 21 And Joash, the king of Israel, went up, and he and Amaziah, the king of Judah, looked at each other face to face at Beth Shemesh, which belonged to Judah.
\v 22 And Judah was struck down before Israel, and each fled to his tent.

\ts\*
\v 23 And Amaziah, the king of Judah, the son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, Joash, the king of Israel, seized at Beth Shemesh. And he brought him to Jerusalem, and he broke through the wall of Jerusalem from the gate of Ephraim until the gate of the Corner, 400 cubits.

\ts\*
\p
\v 25 And Amaziah the son of Joash, the king of Judah, lived after the death of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, the king of Israel, 15 years.

\v 8 And the Ammonites gave tribute to Uzziah. And his name went as far as the border of Egypt because he was becoming strong increasingly.

\ts\*
\v 9 And Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, and at the Valley Gate, and at the Angle, and he made them strong.
\v 10 And he built towers in the wilderness, and he dug out many cisterns, for much cattle was to him, both in the lowlands and in the plains, and plowmen and vinedressers in the hills and in Carmel, for a lover of the ground he was.

\ts\*
\v 11 And there was to Uzziah an army of doers of battle who went out for war according to the troop by the numbering of the mustering by the hand of Jeiel, the scribe, and Maaseiah, the official, under the hand of Hananiah, from the chiefs of the king.

\v 14 And Uzziah prepared for them—for all the army—shields, and spears, and helmets, and armor, and bows, and stones of slings.
\v 15 And he made in Jerusalem war machines, invention of an inventor, to be on the towers and on the corners to shoot arrows and great stones. And his name went out as far as a distance, for he did wondrously to be helped until when he was strong.

\ts\*
\p
\v 16 But at his strength, his heart was high until destroying, and he acted unfaithfully against Yahweh, his God, and he went into the temple of Yahweh to sacrifice on the altar of incense.
\v 17 And Azariah, the priest, went in after him, and with him the priests of Yahweh, 80 sons of strength.
\v 18 And they stood against Uzziah the king, and they said to him, “Not for you, Uzziah, to sacrifice to Yahweh, but for the priests, the sons of Aaron, the ones consecrated to sacrifice. Go out from the sanctuary, for you acted unfaithfully, and not for you for honor from Yahweh God.”

\ts\*
\v 19 And Uzziah raged, and in his hand was a censer to sacrifice. And when he raged against the priests, and the leprosy, it appeared on his forehead before the priests in the house of Yahweh from beside the altar of incense.
\v 20 And Azariah the head priest turned to him, and all the priests, and, behold, he was leprous on his forehead. And they hastened him from there. And also, he himself hastened to go out, for Yahweh afflicted him.

\ts\*
\v 21 And Uzziah the king was leprous until the day of his death. And he dwelled in the house of separation, being leprous, for he was cut off from the house of Yahweh. And Jotham his son was over the house of the king, judging the people of the land.

\ts\*
\v 22 And the remainder of the matters of Uzziah, the first things and the last things, Isaiah, the son of Amoz, the prophet wrote.

\v 9 And there, a prophet of Yahweh was, Oded his name. And he went out before the army coming to Samaria. And he said to them, “Behold, in wrath, Yahweh, the God of your fathers was against Judah; he gave them into your hand. But you all killed them in rage; up to the heavens it reached.
\v 10 And now the sons of Judah and Jerusalem you all are saying to subjugate as male slaves and as female slaves for yourselves. Are you surely not with wrongdoings of your own against Yahweh your God?
\v 11 And now, hear me and bring back the captives whom you all took captive from your brothers. For the burning anger of Yahweh is upon you all.”

\ts\*
\v 12 And men rose from the heads of the sons of Ephraim—Azariah the son of Jehohanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai—against the ones coming from the army.
\v 13 And they said to them, “Do not bring the captives here, for wrongdoing of Yahweh against us you all are saying to add upon our sins and upon our wrongdoings. For much is the guilt to us and the burning anger upon Israel.”

\ts\*
\v 14 And the armed ones released the captives and the spoils before the chiefs and all the assembly.

\v 20 And Tiglath-Pileser, the king of Assyria, came against him. And he harassed him, and he did not strengthen him.
\v 21 For Ahaz divided up the house of Yahweh and the house of the king and the chiefs. And he gave to the king of Assyria, but it was not a help to him.

\v 22 And in the time of his harassment, and he added to act faithlessly against Yahweh, this King Ahaz.

\v 5 And he said to them, “Hear me, Levites! Now, consecrate yourselves and consecrate the house of Yahweh, the God of your fathers, and bring out the defilement from the holy place.

\ts\*
\v 6 For our fathers acted unfaithfully, and they did evil in the eyes of Yahweh our God. And they have abandoned him. And they turned their faces from the tabernacle of Yahweh, and they turned the back.
\v 7 Also, they shut the doors of the porch. And they extinguished the lamps, and incense they did not offer and burnt offerings they did not offer in the holy place of the God of Israel.

\ts\*
\v 8 And the wrath of Yahweh was on Judah and Jerusalem. And he gave them to be a terror, to be a horror, and to be a hissing, just as you all are seeing with your eyes.
\v 9 And behold, our fathers fell by the sword, and our sons, and our daughters, and our wives are in captivity on account of this.

\ts\*
\v 10 Now with my heart to cut a covenant with Yahweh, the God of Israel, so that his burning anger may turn from us.
\v 11 My sons, now, do not be negligent for you all Yahweh has chosen to stand before him, to minister to him, and to be to him ones ministering and ones offering sacrifices.”

\ts\*
\v 15 And they gathered their brothers, and they consecrated themselves, and they entered, according to the commandment of the king with the words of Yahweh, to cleanse the house of Yahweh.
\v 16 And the priests entered the inner part of the house of Yahweh to cleanse; and they brought out all the uncleanness that they found in the temple of Yahweh to the court of the house of Yahweh. And the Levites took to bring out to the brook Kidron outside.
\v 17 And they began on the first of the first month to consecrate. And on the eighth day of the month they came to the porch of Yahweh, and they consecrated the house of Yahweh for eight days. And on the 16 th day of the first month they finished.

\v 20 And Hezekiah the king rose early and gathered the chiefs of the city. And he went up to the house of Yahweh.
\v 21 And they brought seven bulls, and seven rams, and seven lambs, and seven male goats of female goats for a sin offering for the kingdom, and for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he said to the sons of Aaron, the priests, to cause to go up to the altar of Yahweh.

\ts\*
\v 22 And they slaughtered the cattle, and the priests took the blood, and they scattered on the altar. And they slaughtered the rams, and they scattered the blood on the altar. And they slaughtered the lambs, and they scattered the blood on the altar.
\v 23 And they brought near the goats of the sin offering before the king and the assembly, and they laid their hands on them.
\v 24 And the priests slaughtered them, and they made a sin offering with their blood on the altar to atone for all Israel, because “For all Israel,” the king said, “are the burnt offering and the sin offering.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 25 And he stationed the Levites in the house of Yahweh with cymbals, with harps, and with lyres, according to the commandment of David and Gad, the seer of the king, and Nathan the prophet, for by the hand of Yahweh was the commandment by the hand of his prophets.
\v 26 And the Levites stood with the instruments of David and the priests with the trumpets.

\ts\*
\v 27 And Hezekiah said to offer the burnt offering on the altar. And at the time the burnt offering began, the song of Yahweh began and the trumpets, and by the hands of the instruments of David, the king of Israel.

\ts\*
\v 32 And the number of the burnt offering that the assembly brought in was 70 bulls, 100 rams, 200 lambs, for the burnt offering to Yahweh was all these.
\v 33 And the consecrated were 600 bulls and 3, 000 sheep.

\ts\*
\v 34 Except the priests were too few and they were not able to skin all the burnt offerings, so their brothers, the Levites, made them strong until the work was finished, and until the priests consecrated themselves, for the Levites were right of heart to consecrate themselves more than the priests.

\ts\*
\v 35 And also, there were burnt offerings in abundance with the fat of the peace offerings and with the drink offerings for the burnt offering. And the service of the house of Yahweh was established.

\ts\*

\c 30
\p
\v 1 And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and also letters he wrote to Ephraim and Manasseh to come to the house of Yahweh in Jerusalem to do a Passover to Yahweh, the God of Israel.
\v 2 And the king consulted, and his chiefs, and all the assembly in Jerusalem, to do the Passover in the second month.
\v 3 for they were not able to do it at that time because the priests had not consecrated themselves sufficiently, and the people had not assembled to Jerusalem.

\ts\*
\v 4 And the matter was right in the eyes of the king and in the eyes of all the assembly.
\v 5 And they caused to stand a word to cause a voice to pass over among all Israel, from Beersheba and to Dan to come to do a Passover to Yahweh, the God of Israel, in Jerusalem; for they had not in abundance done as was written.
\v 6 And runners went with letters from the hand of the king and his chiefs among all Israel and Judah and according to the command of the king, saying, “Sons of Israel, return to Yahweh, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he will return to the escaped remaining of you all from the palm of the kings of Assyria.

\ts\*
\v 7 And do not be like your fathers and your brothers, who acted unfaithfully against Yahweh, the God of their fathers. And he made them to be a horror, just as you all are seeing.
\v 8 Now, do not harden your neck like your fathers; give hand to Yahweh and come to his sanctuary which he has consecrated forever, and serve Yahweh your God, that he may turn from you all his burning anger.
\v 9 For in your turning back to Yahweh, your brothers and your sons will have mercies before their captors and return this land. For gracious and compassionate is Yahweh your God, and he will not turn away his face from you all, if you return to him.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 10 And the runners were passing from city to city in the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and until Zebulun, but they were mocking them and ridiculing them.
\v 11 However, men from Asher and Manasseh and from Zebulun humbled themselves and came to Jerusalem.
\v 12 Also on Judah was the hand of God to give them one heart to do the command of the king and the chiefs by the word of Yahweh.

\ts\*
\p
\v 13 And many people gathered in Jerusalem to do the Feast of the Unleavened Bread in the second month, a very abundant assembly.
\v 14 And they rose, and they took away the altars that were in Jerusalem, and all the incense altars they took away, and they threw into the brook Kidron.
\v 15 And they slaughtered the Passover lambs on the 14 th of the second month. And the priests and the Levites were ashamed, and they consecrated themselves, and they brought in the burnt offerings to the house of Yahweh.

\ts\*
\v 16 And they stood at their stations according to their judgment, according to the law of Moses, the man of God. The priests were scattering the blood from the hand of the Levites,
\v 17 for many were in the assembly who had not consecrated themselves. And the Levites were over the slaughtering of the Passover lambs for all were not clean to consecrate to Yahweh.

\ts\*
\v 18 For a multitude of the people, many from Ephraim and Manasseh, Issachar and Zebulun, had not purified themselves, but they ate the Passover, against what is written. But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, “May Yahweh who is good atone for
\v 19 everyone who prepares his heart to seek God, Yahweh, the God of his fathers, but not according to the purifying of the holy place.”
\v 20 And Yahweh listened to Hezekiah, and he healed the people.

\ts\*
\v 21 And the sons of Israel who were found in Jerusalem did the Feast of the Unleavened Bread seven days with great joy. And the Levites and the priests were praising Yahweh day by day, with instruments of might to Yahweh.
\v 22 And Hezekiah spoke to the heart of all the Levites, who were insightful with good insight of Yahweh. And they ate the appointed seven days, sacrificing sacrifices of peace offerings and confessing to Yahweh, the God of their fathers.

\ts\*

\v 23 And all the assembly consulted to do seven days after them, and they did seven days joyfully.
\v 24 For Hezekiah the king of Judah contributed to the assembly 1, 000 bulls and 7, 000 sheep; and the chiefs contributed to the assembly 1, 000 bulls and 10, 000 sheep. And many priests consecrated themselves.

\ts\*
\v 25 And they rejoiced, all the assembly of Judah and the priests and the Levites, and all the assembly who came from Israel, and the sojourners who came from the land of Israel and the inhabitants of Judah.
\v 26 And there was great joy in Jerusalem, for from the days of Solomon the son of David, the king of Israel, there was not like this in Jerusalem.
\v 27 And the priests, the Levites, rose, and they blessed the people. And their voice was heard, and their prayer came to his holy dwelling in the heavens.

\c 31
\p
\v 1 And when all this was finished, all Israel who were to be found went out to the cities of Judah, and they shattered the pillars. And they cut to pieces the Asherim, and they tore down the high places and the altars from all Judah and Benjamin, and in Ephraim and Manasseh, until finished. And all the sons of Israel returned, each to his possession, to their cities.

\ts\*
\p
\v 2 And Hezekiah appointed the divisions of the priests and the Levites according to their divisions, each according to the mouth of his service, for the priests and for the Levites for burnt offering and for peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to praise at the gates of the camp of Yahweh.
\v 3 And the portion of the king was from his property for burnt offerings, for the burnt offerings of the morning and the evening and the burnt offerings for the Sabbaths and for the new moons and for the appointed times, as is written in the law of Yahweh.

\ts\*
\v 4 And he said to the people, to the inhabitants of Jerusalem to give the portion of the priests and the Levites, in order that they might be strong in the law of Yahweh.
\v 5 And when the word broke through, the sons of Israel gave in abundance firstfruits of grain, new wine, and oil, and honey, and all the produce of the field. And the tithe of all the abundance they brought in.

\ts\*
\v 6 And the sons of Israel and Judah, the inhabitants in the cities of Judah, also they, the tithe of cattle and sheep, and the tithe of sacred things consecrated to Yahweh their God, they brought in, and they gave heaps, heaps.
\v 7 In the third month, they began the heaps to establish, and in the seventh month they finished.
\v 8 And Hezekiah and the chiefs came, and they saw the heaps. And they blessed Yahweh and his people Israel.

\ts\*
\v 9 And Hezekiah sought the priests and the Levites about the heaps.
\v 10 And Azariah, the head priest, of the house of Zadok, said to him, and he said, “From the beginning of the bringing of the contribution to the house of Yahweh we ate, and were full and had left over in abundance, for Yahweh has blessed his people, and this abundance is left.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 11 And Hezekiah said to prepare the chambers in the house of Yahweh, and they prepared.
\v 12 And they brought in the contribution and the tithe and the sacred things in faithfulness. And over them as a leader was Konaniah the Levite, and Shimei his brother, second.
\v 13 And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth, and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismakiah, and Mahath, and Benaiah were overseers under the hand of Konaniah and Shimei his brother, by the arrangement of Hezekiah, the king, and Azariah, the leader over the house of God.

\ts\*
\v 14 And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the gatekeeper to the east was over the free will offering of God, to give the contribution of Yahweh and the most holy things,
\v 15 and by his hand Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and Shemaiah, and Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the priests in faithfulness to give to their brothers in divisions, like great, like small,

\v 16 regardless of their genealogy, to males from a son of three years and upward, to all who came into the house of Yahweh, by the matter of a day in its day, for their service by their charges according to their divisions,\f + \ft Instead of \fqa males three years old and up\fqa*, some modern versions have \fqa males thirty years old and up\fqa*.\f*

\v 19 And for the sons of Aaron, the priests, in the fields of open land of their cities, in each city and city, were men who were marked by names to give portions to every male among the priests, and to all genealogically among the Levites.

\ts\*
\p
\v 20 And Hezekiah did like this in all Judah. And he did what is good, and what is right, and faithful before Yahweh his God.
\v 21 And in every deed that he began in the service of the house of God, and by the law, and by the commandment to seek his God, with all his heart he did and succeeded.

\c 32
\p
\v 1 After these things and faithfulness, Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, came. And he came into Judah. And he encamped against the fortified cities. And he said to capture them for himself.

\ts\*
\v 2 And Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib had come and his face was to battle against Jerusalem.
\v 3 And he consulted with his chiefs and his mighty ones to stop up the waters of the springs that were outside the city; and they helped him.
\v 4 And many people gathered, and they stopped up all the springs and the stream that was flowing in the midst of the land, saying, “Why should the kings of Assyria come and find many waters?”

\ts\*
\v 5 And he strengthened himself. And he built all the broken wall, and he brought up the towers and the other outer wall. And he strengthened the Millo in the city of David. And he made weapons in abundance and shields.\f + \ft Instead of \fqa and he brought up the towers\fqa*, some ancient and modern versions have, \fqa he built towers on it\fqa*, that is, on the wall.\f*

\ts\*
\v 6 And he placed chiefs of battle over the people. And he gathered them to himself to the plaza at the city gate. And he spoke to their heart, saying,
\v 7 “Be strong and be courageous. Do not be afraid, and do not be dismayed from before the king of Assyria and from before all the multitude that is with him, for with us is one greater than with him.
\v 8 With him, an arm of flesh, but with us, Yahweh, our God, to help us and to fight our battles.” And the people leaned on the words of Hezekiah, the king of Judah.

\ts\*
\p
\v 9 After this, Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, sent his servants to Jerusalem (and he was by Lachish, and all his military strength was with him) to Hezekiah, the king of Judah, and to all Judah who was in Jerusalem, saying,
\v 10 “Thus says Sennacherib, the king of Assyria: On what are you all trusting and dwelling in siege in Jerusalem?

\ts\*
\v 11 Is not Hezekiah misleading you all, to give you all to die by famine and by thirst, saying, ‘Yahweh our God will deliver us from the palm of the king of Assyria’?
\v 12 Did not he, Hezekiah, take away his high places and his altars and he said to Judah and to Jerusalem, saying, ‘Before one altar you all must worship, and on it you all must make sacrifice’?

\ts\*
\v 13 Do you all not know what I have done, I and my fathers, to all the peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of the lands surely able to deliver their land from my hand?
\v 14 Who is among all the gods of these nations whom my fathers devoted to destruction who is able to deliver his people from my hand, that your God is able to deliver you all from my hand?
\v 15 And now do not let Hezekiah deceive you all and do not let him mislead you all like this. And do not believe him for any god of any nation or kingdom has not been able to deliver his people from my hand or from the hand of my fathers. Also, indeed, your God will not deliver you all from my hand.”

\ts\*
\v 16 And again his servants spoke against Yahweh God and against Hezekiah, his servant.
\v 17 And letters he wrote to taunt Yahweh, the God of Israel, and to speak against him, saying, “Like the gods of the nations of the lands who did not deliver their people from my hand, thus the God of Hezekiah will not deliver his people from my hand.”

\ts\*
\v 18 And they called in a great voice in Judean against the people of Jerusalem who were on the wall, to frighten them and to dismay them, in order that they might capture the city.
\v 19 And they spoke about the God of Jerusalem as against the gods of the peoples of the land, the work of the hands of man.

\ts\*
\p
\v 20 And Hezekiah, the king, prayed, and Isaiah the son of Amoz, the prophet, about this, and they cried out to the heavens.
\v 21 And Yahweh sent an angel, and he wiped out all the mighty ones of the army and leaders and chiefs in the camp of the king of Assyria. And he returned with shame on faces to his land. And he came to the house of his god, and some of the ones coming forth from his inward parts, there they caused him to fall by the sword.

\ts\*
\v 22 And Yahweh saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib, the king of Assyria, and from the hand of all. And he gave them rest all around.\f + \ft Instead of \fqa gave them rest all around\fqa*, some ancient and modern versions have \fqa guided them on every side\fqa*.

\v 23 And many were bringing gifts to Yahweh to Jerusalem and precious things to Hezekiah the king of Judah. And he was lifted up in the eyes of all the nations from after that.

\ts\*
\p
\v 24 In those days Hezekiah was sick unto death. And he prayed to Yahweh, and he spoke to him. And a sign he gave to him.
\v 25 But according to the benefit to him Hezekiah did not return, for his heart was high. And there was on him wrath and on Judah and Jerusalem.
\v 26 And Hezekiah humbled himself from the height of his heart, he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the wrath of Yahweh did not come upon them in the days of Hezekiah.
\ts\*
\p
\v 27 And there was to Hezekiah very many riches and glory, and treasuries he made for himself for silver, and for gold, and for precious stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all desirable items,
\v 28 and storehouses for produce of grain, and new wine, and oil, and stalls for all beasts and beasts, and flocks for the stalls.
\v 29 And cities he made for himself and livestock of sheep and cattle in abundance, for God gave to him very much property.\f + \ft Instead of \fqa cities\fqa*, some modern versions have \fqa donkeys\fqa*, and some other modern versions leave out the word entirely.\f*

\ts\*
\v 30 And this same Hezekiah stopped up the upper outlet of the waters of Gihon, and he directed them down to the west side of the city of David. And Hezekiah succeeded in all his work.
\v 31 And thus, when the envoys of the chiefs of Babylon sent to him to seek the sign that was in the land, God left him to test him, to know all in his heart.

\ts\*
\p
\v 32 And the remainder of the matters of Hezekiah, and his covenant faithfulnesses, behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah, the son of Amoz, the prophet, on the scroll of the kings of Judah and Israel.
\v 33 And Hezekiah laid down with his fathers, and they buried him in the ascent of the graves of the sons of David. And honor they did for him in his death, all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. And Manasseh his son reigned in his place.


\ts\*

\c 33
\p
\v 1 A son of 12 years was Manasseh when he became king; and 55 years he reigned in Jerusalem.
\v 2 And he did what was evil in the eyes of Yahweh, like the abominations of the nations whom Yahweh had driven out from before the sons of Israel.
\v 3 And he turned and built the high places that Hezekiah his father had torn down, and he erected altars to the Baals, and he made Asheroth, and he bowed down to all the host of the heavens, and he served them.

\ts\*
\v 4 And he built altars in the house of Yahweh, about which Yahweh had said, “In Jerusalem, my name will be forever.”
\v 5 And he built altars for all the host of the heavens in the two courts of the house of Yahweh.
\v 6 And he himself caused his sons to pass through the fire in the Valley of Ben Hinnom and he practiced soothsaying, and divination, and he practiced magic, and he dealth with mediums and spirists. He multiplied doing what was evil in the eyes of Yahweh to provoke him to anger.

\ts\*
\v 7 And he put the image of the idol which he made in the house of God of which God said to David and to Solomon his son, “In this house and in Jerusalem which I have chosen from all the tribes of Israel, I will set my name forever.
\v 8 And I will not again remove the foot of Israel from upon the soil that I appointed for your fathers, only if they are careful to do all that I commanded them, all the law, and the statutes, and the judgments by the hand of Moses.”
\v 9 And Manasseh led astray Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to do evil more than the nations that Yahweh had exterminated from before the sons of Israel.

\ts\*
\p
\v 10 And Yahweh spoke to Manasseh and to his people, but they did not pay attention.
\v 11 And Yahweh brought against them the chiefs of the army which belonged to the king of Assyria. And they captured Manasseh in chains, and they bound him in bronze, and they took him to Babylon.

\ts\*
\v 12 And when he was in distress, he entreated the face of Yahweh, his God, and he humbled himself much from before the God of his fathers.
\v 13 And he prayed to him; and he was entreated by him, and he heard his supplication, and he brought him back to Jerusalem to his kingdom. And Manasseh knew that Yahweh, he is God.

\ts\*
\p
\v 14 And after this, he built an outer wall for the city of David, on the west of Gihon, in the valley, and at the entrance of the Fish Gate, and around the hill, and he made it very high. And he put chiefs of the army in all the fortified cities in Judah.
\v 15 And he took away the foreign gods, and the idol from the house of Yahweh, and all the altars that he built on the mountain of the house of Yahweh and in Jerusalem. And he threw them outside the city.

\ts\*
\v 16 And he built the altar of Yahweh, and he sacrificed on it sacrifices of peace offerings and thank offerings. And he said to Judah to serve Yahweh, the God of Israel.
\v 17 However, the people were still sacrificing on the high places, only to Yahweh, their God.

\ts\*
\p
\v 18 And the remainder of the matters of Manasseh, and his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers, those speaking to him in the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel, behold, they are on the words of the kings of Israel.
\v 19 And his prayer and how he was entreated by him, and all his sin, and his unfaithfulness, and the places where he built in them high places, and he raised Asherim and idols before he humbled himself—behold, they are written in the Words of Hozai.\f + \ft Some modern versions have \fqa the Words of Hozai\fqa*, which is the reading of the original text.

\v 20 And Manasseh laid down with his fathers, and they buried him in his house. And Amon, his son, became king in his place.

\ts\*
\p
\v 21 A son of 22 years was Amon when he became king; and two years he reigned in Jerusalem.
\v 22 And he did what was evil in the eyes of Yahweh, just as Manasseh, his father, had done. And to all the idols that Manasseh his father made, Amon sacrificed, and he served them.
\v 23 And he did not humble himself from before Yahweh, as Manasseh his father humbled himself, for this Amon multiplied guilt.

\ts\*
\v 24 And his servants conspired against him, and they put him to death in his house.
\v 25 But the people of the land struck down all those who had conspired against King Amon, and the people of the land made Josiah, his son, king in his place.

\v 1 A son of eight years was Josiah when he became king; and 31 years he reigned in Jerusalem.
\v 2 And he did what was right in the eyes of Yahweh, and he walked in the ways of David his father, and he did not turn to the right or to the left.
\v 3 And in the eighth year of his reigning, and he was still a youth, he began to seek the God of David, his father. And in the 12 th year, he began to cleanse Judah and Jerusalem from the high places, and the Asherim, and the idols, and the metal images.

\ts\*
\v 4 And they tore down before him the altars of the Baals, and the incense altars which were above them he cut to pieces. And the Asherim and the idols and the metal images he shattered, and he crushed, and he scattered over the faces of the graves of those who sacrificed to them.
\v 5 And the bones of the priests he burned on their altars. And he cleansed Judah and Jerusalem,

\v 6 and in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and Simeon, and until Naphtali, in the hills of their houses all around.
\v 7 And he tore down the altars, and the Asherim and the idols he beat to pieces to grinding, and all the incense altars he cut to pieces in all the land of Israel. And he returned to Jerusalem.

\ts\*
\p
\v 8 And in the 18 th year of his reigning, to cleanse the land and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah, and Maaseiah, the chief of the city, and Joah the son of Joahaz the secretary, to make strong the house of Yahweh his God.
\v 9 And they came to Hilkiah, the great priest, and they gave the money that had been brought to the house of God, that the Levites gathered, the keepers of the threshold, from the hand of Manasseh and Ephraim, and from all the remnant of Israel, and from all Judah and Benjamin, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

\ts\*
\v 10 And they gave to the hand of the doer of the work, the ones appointed over the house of Yahweh. And they gave it to the doers of the work who were working on the house of Yahweh to repair and to make strong the house.
\v 11 And they gave to the craftsmen and the builders to buy cut stone and woods for the braces, and to make beams for the houses that the kings of Judah had destroyed.

\ts\*
\v 12 And the men were working with faithfulness in the work. And over them were appointed Jahath, and Obadiah, the Levites from the sons of Merari, and Zechariah, and Meshullam, from the sons of the Kohathites, to direct, and the Levites, all who understand about the instruments of song.
\v 13 And over the burden bearers and directors for every doer of the work for service and service, and from the Levites, were scribes and officials and gatekeepers.

\ts\*
\p
\v 14 And when they were bringing out the money that had been brought into the house of Yahweh, Hilkiah the priest found the scroll of the law of Yahweh by the hand of Moses.
\v 15 And Hilkiah answered, and he said to Shaphan the scribe, “The scroll of the law I have found in the house of Yahweh.” And Hilkiah gave the scroll to Shaphan.
\v 16 And Shaphan brought the scroll to the king, and brought further to the king word, saying, “All that was given by the hand of your servants they are doing.

\ts\*
\v 17 And they poured out the money that was found in the house of Yahweh, and they gave it to the hand of those appointed and to the hand of the doers of the work.”
\v 18 And Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, “A scroll Hilkiah the priest gave to me.” And Shaphan read from it before the king.
\v 19 And it happened when the king heard the words of the law, and he tore his clothes.

\ts\*
\v 20 And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah, the servant of the king, saying,
\v 21 “Go, seek Yahweh on behalf of me, and on behalf of the one who remains in Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the scroll that has been found.

\v 22 And Hilkiah went, and those of the king, to Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tokhath, the son of Hasrah, the keeper of the garments. And she was dwelling in Jerusalem in the Second. And they spoke to her about this.

\ts\*
\v 23 And she said to them, “Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: Say to the man who sent you all to me,

\v 31 And the king stood in his place, and he cut the covenant before Yahweh, to walk after Yahweh, and to keep his commandments, and his testimony, and his statutes, with all his heart and with all his being, to do the words of the covenant that were written on this scroll.

\v 3 And he said to the Levites who are teaching all Israel, who are sacred to Yahweh, “Place the Holy Box in the house that Solomon, the son of David, the king of Israel built; not to you all a burden on your shoulder. Now serve Yahweh your God and his people Israel.
