\v 1 And these are the names of the sons of Israel, the ones who came to Egypt. They came in with Jacob, a man and his house:
\v 2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,
\v 3 Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,
\v 4 Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.
\v 5 And all the lives going out of the loins of Jacob, were 70 lives. And Joseph was in Egypt.
\ts\*
\v 6 And Joseph and all his brothers and all that generation died.
\v 7 And the sons of Israel were fruitful and propagated and multiplied and were mighty, with great greatness, and the land was filled with them.
\ts\*
\p
\v 8 And a new king arose over Egypt, who did not know Joseph.
\v 9 And he said to his people, “Behold, the people of the sons of Israel are many and mighty compared to us.
\v 10 Come, let us act wisely toward him, lest he multiplies, and it happens that a battle occurs, and he even adds himself onto the ones hating us, and he fights with us, and he leaves from the land.”
\ts\*
\v 11 And they set over him overseers of labor gangs in order to afflict him by their burdens. And he built Pithom and Rameses, cities of storage for Pharaoh.
\v 12 And insofar as they afflicted him, thus he multiplied and thus he spread out. And they felt a sickening dread from the face of the sons of Israel.
\ts\*
\v 13 And the Egyptians enslaved the sons of Israel with rigor.
\v 14 And they embittered their lives by hard slavery, by mortar and by bricks, and by all kinds of slave labor in the fields; all their work with which they worked for them was with rigor.
\ts\*
\p
\v 15 And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, of whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the second was Puah.
\v 16 And he said, “When you assist the Hebrew women as midwives and you see on the birth stool, if he is a son, then you shall cause him to die, but if she is a daughter, then she shall live.”
\ts\*
\v 17 But the midwives feared God and did not do according to what the king of Egypt spoke to them, and they let the sons live.
\v 18 And the king of Egypt called out to the midwives, and he said to them, “Why have you done this thing, and let the sons live?”
\p
\v 19 And the midwives said to Pharaoh, “Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women: for they are lively, and, before the midwife comes to them, they have given birth.”
\ts\*
\v 20 And God caused good to the midwives. And the people multiplied and became very mighty.
\v 21 And it came about, since the midwives feared God, that he made houses for them.
\ts\*
\p
\v 22 And Pharaoh commanded to all of his people, saying, “You shall throw every newborn son into the river, but every daughter you shall let live.”
\ts\*


\c 2
\p
\v 1 And a man from the house of Levi went and took a daughter of Levi.
\v 2 And the woman conceived, and she birthed a son. And she saw him, that he was good, and she hid him three months.
\ts\*
\v 3 And she was not able to hide him still, and she took for him an ark of papyrus reeds and she daubed it with bitumen and with pitch. And she placed the child in it, and she placed it in the reeds along the shore of the river.
\v 4 And his sister stationed herself at a distance to know what would be done to him.
\ts\*
\p
\v 5 And a daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash at the river, and her young women were walking along the hand of the river. And she saw the ark in the middle of the reeds, and she sent her slave woman, and she took it
\v 6 and opened, and she saw him, the child—and behold, a crying boy. And she had compassion on him, and she said, “This one is from the children of the Hebrews.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 7 And his sister said to the daughter of Pharaoh, “Should I go and call for you a nursing woman from the Hebrews? And she could cause the child to nurse for you.”
\p
\v 8 And the daughter of Pharaoh said to her, “Go.” And the girl went and called the mother of the child.
\v 9 And the daughter of Pharaoh said to her, “Take this child and cause him to nurse for me, and I shall give your wages.”
\ts\*
And the woman took the child and caused him to nurse.
\v 10 And the child grew older, and she brought him to the daughter of Pharaoh, and he became as a son to her. And she called his name Moses, and she said, “For out of the water I drew him.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 11 And it happened in those days that Moses had grown up. And he went out to his brothers and saw their burdens. And he saw an Egyptian man striking a Hebrew man from his brothers.
\v 12 And he turned this way and that way, and he saw that there was no man, and he struck the Egyptian, and he hid him in the sand.
\ts\*
\v 13 And he went out the second day, and behold, two Hebrew men were fighting. And he said to the guilty one, “Why are you striking your companion?”
\p
\v 14 And he said, “Who set you as the ruler man and judge over us? Are you saying to kill me like you killed the Egyptian?”
\ts\*
\p
And Moses feared and said, “Certainly the thing is known.”
\v 15 And Pharaoh heard this thing, and he sought to kill Moses. And Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh.
\ts\*
\p
And he dwelt in the land of Midian, and he sat down by a well.
\v 16 And the priest of Midian had seven daughters. And they came and drew and filled up the troughs to cause the flock of their father to drink water.
\v 17 And the men who were shepherding came and drove them away, but Moses arose and saved them and caused their flock to drink water.
\ts\*
\p
\v 18 And they came to Reuel their father, and he said, “Why have you hurried coming today?”
\p
\v 19 And they said, “An Egyptian man rescued us from the hand of the men who were shepherding. And he even drew especially for us and caused the flock to drink water.”
\p
\v 20 And he said to his daughters, “And where is he? What is this? You left the man? Call him and he shall eat bread!”
\ts\*
\p
\v 21 And Moses was willing to dwell with the man, and he gave Zipporah his daughter to Moses.
\v 22 And she birthed a son, and he called his name Gershom; for he said, “I have become a foreigner in a foreign land.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 23 And it happened in these many days that the king of Egypt died. And the sons of Israel groaned from the slavery. And they cried out, and their plea ascended to God from their slavery.
\v 24 And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.
\v 25 And God saw the sons of Israel, and God knew.
\ts\*


\c 3
\p
\v 1 And Moses was shepherding the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian. And he led the flock beyond the wilderness, and he came to the mountain of God, to Horeb.
\v 2 And the angel of Yahweh appeared to him in a flame of fire from the middle of a bush. And he looked, and behold, the bush was burning in the fire, but the bush was not being consumed.
\v 3 And Moses said, “Let me turn aside and see this great sight! Why does the bush not burn up?”
\ts\*
\p
\v 4 And Yahweh saw that he had turned aside in order to look, and God called to him from the middle of the bush, and he said, “Moses, Moses.”
\p
And he said, “Behold me!”
\p
\v 5 And he said, “You must not come close to here. Take your sandals off from on your feet, for the place on which you are standing, it is holy ground.”
\v 6 And he said, “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid from staring toward God.
\ts\*
\v 7 And Yahweh said, “I have certainly seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt. And I have heard their cries from the faces of those who oppress him. I surely know his anguish.
\v 8 And I have come down to deliver him from the hand of the Egyptians and to bring him up from that land to a good and wide land, to a land flowing with milk and honey; to the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites.
\ts\*
\v 9 And now, behold, the cry of the sons of Israel has come to me. And moreover, I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians are oppressing them.
\v 10 And now go, and I shall send you to Pharaoh, and bring out my people, the sons of Israel, from Egypt.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 11 And Moses said to God, “Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring out the sons of Israel from Egypt?”
\p
\v 12 And he said, “I shall certainly be with you, and this will be the sign for you that I have sent you: when you bring the people out from Egypt, you all will serve God on this mountain.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 13 And Moses said to God, “Behold, I am about to go to the sons of Israel, and I will say to them, ‘The God of your fathers has sent me to you.’ And they will say to me, ‘What is his name?’ what should I say to them?”
\p
\v 14 And God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM.” And he said, “You shall speak this way to the sons of Israel, ‘I AM sent me to you.’”
\v 15 And God also said to Moses, “You shall speak this way to the sons of Israel: ‘Yahweh, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, sent me to you. This is my name forever, and this is my memorial from generation to generation.’
\ts\*
\p
\v 16 Go and gather the elders of Israel, and say to them, ‘Yahweh, the God of your fathers, appeared to me, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to say, “I have certainly attended to you and what is being done to you in Egypt,
\v 17 and I said, ‘I will bring you up from affliction in Egypt to the land of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the Amorites and the Perizzites and the Hivites and the Jebusites, to a land flowing with milk and honey.’”’
\ts\*
\v 18 And they will listen to your voice.
\p
And you and the elders of Israel will go to the king of Egypt, and you all will say to him, ‘Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. And now please let us go a journey of three days into the wilderness, and let us sacrifice to Yahweh, our God.’
\v 19 And I know that the king of Egypt will not permit you to go, and not with a strong hand.
\v 20 And I shall send out my hand, and I shall strike Egypt with all my wonders, which I shall do within him. And after that, he will send you out.
\ts\*
\p
\v 21 And I shall give this people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians, and it will be that when you go, you will not go emptily.
\v 22 And a woman will ask from her neighbor and from one sojourning in her house for items of silver and items of gold and clothing. And you will put them on your sons and on your daughters, and you will plunder the Egyptians.”
\ts\*


\c 4
\p
\v 1 And Moses answered and said, “But look, they will not believe me, and they will not listen to my voice; for they will say, ‘Yahweh has not appeared to you.’”
\p
\v 2 And Yahweh said to him, “What is that in your hand?”
\p
And he said, “A staff.”
\p
\v 3 And he said, “Throw it to the ground.” And he threw it to the ground, and it became a snake. And Moses fled from its face.
\ts\*
\v 4 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Reach out your hand and take it by its tail”—and he reached out his hand and he caught it to him, and it became a staff in his palm—
\v 5 “in order to cause them to believe that Yahweh appeared to you, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 6 And Yahweh also said to him, “Put your hand in your bosom.” And he put his hand in his bosom. And he brought it out, and behold, his hand was being struck with a skin disease like snow.
\v 7 And he said, “Return your hand into your bosom.” And he returned his hand into his bosom, and he brought it out from his bosom, and behold, it was restored like his flesh.
\ts\*
\p
\v 8 “And it will be, if they do not believe you, and they do not listen to the voice of the first sign, then they will believe the voice of the following sign.
\v 9 And it will be, if they do not believe even these two signs, and they do not listen to your voice, then you shall take from the water of the river and you shall pour it on the dry land. And it will happen, the water which you take from the river, that it will become blood on the dry land.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 10 And Moses said to Yahweh, “Oh my Lord, I am not a man of words; not since yesterday, nor since three days ago, nor since you spoke to your servant. For I am heavy of mouth and heavy of tongue.”
\p
\v 11 And Yahweh said to him, “Who put a mouth in mankind, or who makes a mute or a deaf or a seeing or a blind? Is it not I, Yahweh?
\v 12 And now go! And I shall be with your mouth, and I shall teach you what you will speak.”
\p
\v 13 And he said, “Oh my Lord, please send by a hand you send.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 14 And the nose of Yahweh burned at Moses, and he said, “Is not Aaron, the Levite, your brother? I know that he can speak well. And even more, behold, he is coming to meet you, and he will see you and he will be glad in his heart.
\v 15 And you shall speak to him, and you shall put the words in his mouth. And I am with your mouth and with his mouth, and I will teach you both what you should do.
\v 16 And he will speak to the people for you. So it will be, he will be like a mouth for you, and you will be like God to him.
\v 17 And you shall take in your hand this staff, with which you will do the signs.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 18 And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and he said to him, “Please let me go, and let me return to my brothers who are in Egypt and see whether they are still alive.”
\p
And Jethro said to Moses, “Go in peace.”
\p
\v 19 And Yahweh said to Moses in Midian, “Go! Return to Egypt! For all the men who were seeking your life are dead.”
\v 20 And Moses took his wife and his sons and caused them to ride on a donkey, and he returned toward the land of Egypt. And Moses took the staff of God in his hand.
\ts\*
\v 21 And Yahweh said to Moses, “While you are going to return to Egypt, see all the miracles that I put in your hand, and do them before the face of Pharaoh. But as for me, I shall strengthen his heart, and he will not let the people go.
\v 22 And say to Pharaoh, ‘Thus says Yahweh: “Israel is my son, my firstborn,
\v 23 and I said to you, ‘Let my son go that he may serve me.’ But you have refused to let him go. Behold, I shall kill your son, your firstborn.”’”
\ts\*
\p
\v 24 And it happened on the road, in the lodging-place, that he encountered Yahweh, and he sought to kill him.
\v 25 And Zipporah took a flint, and she cut off the foreskin of her son, and she touched it to his feet, and she said, “Surely you are a bridegroom of blood to me.”
\v 26 And he relented from him. That was when she said, “bridegroom of blood” because of the circumcision.
\ts\*
\p
\v 27 And Yahweh said to Aaron, “Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.” And he went, and he met him at the mountain of God, and he kissed him.
\v 28 And Moses told Aaron all the words of Yahweh that he had sent him and all the signs that he commanded him.
\ts\*
\p
\v 29 And Moses and Aaron went, and they gathered all of the elders of the sons of Israel.
\v 30 And Aaron spoke all of the words that Yahweh had spoken to Moses. And he did the signs before the eyes of the people,
\v 31 and the people believed. And they heard that Yahweh had attended to the sons of Israel and that he had seen their affliction, and they bowed and prostrated themselves.
\ts\*


\c 5
\p
\v 1 And afterward, Moses and Aaron went in and said to Pharaoh, “Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: ‘Let my people go, and they shall celebrate me in the wilderness.’”
\p
\v 2 And Pharaoh said, “Who is Yahweh, that I should listen to his voice to let Israel go? I do not know Yahweh, and moreover, I shall not let Israel go.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 3 And they said, “The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please, let us go a journey of three days into the wilderness, and let us sacrifice to Yahweh our God, lest he come upon us with the plague or with the sword.”
\p
\v 4 And the king of Egypt said to them, “Moses and Aaron, why are you causing the people to leave off from their tasks? Go to your burdens.”
\p
\v 5 And Pharaoh said, “Behold, the people of the land are now many, and you have caused them to rest from their burdens.”
\ts\*
\v 6 And on that day, Pharaoh ordered the taskmasters among the people and officers, saying,
\v 7 “Do not continue to give straw to the people to make bricks as yesterday and the day before yesterday. They shall go and gather straw for themselves.
\v 8 But you shall put on them the quota of the bricks which they were making yesterday and the day before yesterday; do not diminish from it. For they are idle. Therefore they are crying, saying, ‘Let us go, let us sacrifice to our God.’
\v 9 Let the slavery be heavy on the men so they shall do it and shall not gaze at words of lies.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 10 And the taskmasters of the people and officers went out and said to the people, saying, “Thus says Pharaoh: ‘I am not giving straw to you.
\v 11 You go and get your own straw from wherever you might find it, for there will be no reducing of things from your slavery.’”
\ts\*
\v 12 So the people dispersed throughout all the land of Egypt to gather stubble for straw.
\v 13 Now the taskmasters were hastening them, saying, “Finish your work, the task of day by day, as when there was straw.”
\v 14 And the officers of the sons of Israel, whom the taskmasters of Pharaoh had put over them, were beaten, saying, “Why have you not finished your required brick making like yesterday and the day before yesterday, neither yesterday nor today?”
\ts\*
\p
\v 15 And the officers of the sons of Israel came in and cried to Pharaoh, saying, “Why are you doing this to your servants?
\v 16 No straw is being given to your servants. And they are saying to us, ‘Make bricks!’ And behold, your servants are beaten, but it is the sin of your people.”
\p
\v 17 And he said, “You are lazy! Lazy! That is why you are saying, ‘Let us go sacrifice to Yahweh.’
\v 18 And now go! Work! And straw will not be given to you, but you will give the set quantity of bricks.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 19 And the officers of the sons of Israel saw themselves in distress regarding the saying, “You shall not reduce the day-by-day task from your bricks.”
\v 20 And they met Moses and Aaron, who were waiting to meet them when they came out from Pharaoh.
\v 21 And they said to them, “May Yahweh look on you and judge; for you have caused our scent to stink in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants, to give a sword into their hand to kill us.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 22 And Moses went back to Yahweh and said, “My Lord, why have you afflicted this people? Was this why you sent me?
\v 23 And since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has afflicted this people. And you have certainly not rescued your people.”

\c 6
\p
\v 1 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh: for by a strong hand he will let them go; and by a strong hand he will drive them out of his land.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 2 And God spoke to Moses, and said to him, “I am Yahweh
\v 3 and I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as El Shaddai; but by my name Yahweh I was not known to them.
\v 4 And moreover, I established my covenant with them, to give to them the land of Canaan, the land of their sojourning, in which they sojourned.
\v 5 And moreover, I have heard the groaning of the sons of Israel, whom the Egyptians are enslaving, and I have remembered my covenant.
\ts\*
\p
\v 6 Therefore, say to the sons of Israel, ‘I am Yahweh. And I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will rescue you from their slavery. And I will redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great judgments.
\v 7 And I will take you to myself as a people, and I will be to you as God. And you will know that I am Yahweh your God, the one bringing you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.
\v 8 And I will bring you to the land that I raised my hand to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. And I will give it to you as a possession. I am Yahweh.’”
\ts\*
\p
\v 9 And Moses spoke in this way to the sons of Israel, but they did not listen to Moses, because of shortness of spirit and because of hard slavery.
\ts\*
\p
\v 10 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 11 “Go speak to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, that he should let the sons of Israel go from his land.”
\p
\v 12 And Moses spoke before the face of Yahweh, saying, “Behold, the sons of Israel have not listened to me, so how will Pharaoh listen to me? And I have uncircumcised lips.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 13 And Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, and he gave them a command to the sons of Israel and to Pharaoh, king of Egypt: to bring the sons of Israel out from the land of Egypt.
\ts\*
\p
\v 14 These were the heads of the houses of their fathers:
\p
The sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel: Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Karmi. These were the clans of Reuben.
\p
\v 15 And the sons of Simeon were Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and Jakin, and Zohar, and Shaul—the son of a Canaanite woman. These were the clans of Simeon.
\ts\*
\p
\v 16 And these are the names of the sons of Levi, from their genealogy: Gershon, and Kohath, and Merari. And the years of the life of Levi were 137 years.
\v 17 The sons of Gershon were Libni and Shimei, according to their clans.
\v 18 And the sons of Kohath were Amram and Izhar and Hebron and Uzziel. And the years of the life of Kohath were 133 years.
\v 19 And the sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi. These were the clans of the Levites, according to their genealogy.
\ts\*
\p
\v 20 And Amram took Jochebed, his aunt, as a wife for himself. And she bore him Aaron and Moses. And the years of the life of Amram were 137 years.
\p
\v 21 And the sons of Izhar were Korah, and Nepheg, and Zichri.
\v 22 And the sons of Uzziel were Mishael, and Elzaphan, and Sithri.
\ts\*
\p
\v 23 And Aaron took Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab, the sister of Nahshon, as a wife for himself. And she bore him Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar.
\p
\v 24 And the sons of Korah were Assir, and Elkanah, and Abiasaph. These were the clans of the Korahites.
\v 25 And Eleazar, son of Aaron took a wife for himself from the daughters of Putiel. And she bore him Phinehas. These were the heads of the fathers of the Levites, according to their clans.
\ts\*
\p
\v 26 It was Aaron and Moses to whom Yahweh said, “Bring out the sons of Israel from the land of Egypt by their hosts.”
\v 27 They were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, to bring out the sons of Israel from Egypt. It was Moses and Aaron.
\ts\*
\p
\v 28 And it happened on a day that Yahweh spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt,
\v 29 and Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying, “I am Yahweh. Speak to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, everything that I speak to you.”
\p
\v 30 But Moses said to the face of Yahweh, “Behold, I have uncircumcised lips, so how will Pharaoh listen to me?”
\ts\*


\c 7
\p
\v 1 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Look, I have made you God to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron will be your prophet.
\v 2 You shall say everything that I will command you. And your brother Aaron shall speak to Pharaoh that he should let the sons of Israel go from his land.
\ts\*
\v 3 But I will harden the heart of Pharaoh, and I will multiply my signs and my miracles in the land of Egypt.
\v 4 And Pharaoh will not listen to you, so I will put my hand on Egypt and will bring out my armies, my people, the sons of Israel, from the land of Egypt with great judgments.
\v 5 And the Egyptians will know that I am Yahweh when I stretch out my hand over Egypt to bring the sons of Israel out from their midst.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 6 And Moses and Aaron did; they did just as Yahweh commanded them.
\v 7 And Moses was a son of 80 years and Aaron was a son of 83 years when they were speaking to Pharaoh.
\ts\*
\p
\v 8 And Yahweh said to Moses and to Aaron saying,
\v 9 “For Pharaoh will speak to you, saying, ‘Create a miracle yourself,’ and you shall say to Aaron, ‘Take your staff and throw it down before the face of Pharaoh; let it become a serpent.’”
\ts\*
\p
\v 10 And Moses and Aaron entered in to Pharaoh, and they did just as Yahweh commanded. And Aaron threw down his staff before the face of Pharaoh and before the faces of his servants, and it became a serpent.
\v 11 And Pharaoh also called for wise men and sorcerers. And the magicians of Egypt also did so by their magic.
\v 12 And each man threw down his staff, and they became serpents. And the staff of Aaron swallowed up their staffs.
\v 13 And the heart of Pharaoh was strong, and he did not listen to them, just as Yahweh had spoken.
\ts\*
\p
\v 14 And Yahweh said to Moses, “The heart of Pharaoh is heavy; he has refused to let the people go.
\v 15 Go to Pharaoh. Behold, in the morning he goes out to the water, so station yourself to meet him on the edge of the river. And take in your hand the staff that turned into a snake.
\ts\*
\v 16 And say to him, ‘Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to you to say, “Let my people go, and they will serve me in the wilderness. And behold, until now, you have not listened.”
\v 17 Thus says Yahweh: “By this you will know that I am Yahweh. Behold, I am about to strike against the waters that are in the river with the staff that is in my hand, and they will turn to blood.
\v 18 And the fish that are in the river will die, and the river will stink. And the Egyptians will exhaust themselves to drink water from the river.”’”
\ts\*
\p
\v 19 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt; over their streams, over their canals, and over their pools, and over every reservoir of their water, and it will become blood.’ And there will be blood in all the land of Egypt, both in containers of wood and in containers of stone.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 20 And Moses and Aaron did so, just as Yahweh commanded. And he raised the staff, and he struck the water that was in the river, in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants. And all the water that was in the river turned to blood.
\v 21 And the fish that were in the river died, and the river stank, so the Egyptians were not able to drink water from the river. And the blood was in all the land of Egypt.
\v 22 And the magicians of Egypt did the same with their magic. And the heart of Pharaoh was strong, and he did not listen to them, just as Yahweh had spoken.
\ts\*
\v 23 And Pharaoh turned around and went into his house. And he did not set his heart even to this.
\v 24 And all the Egyptians dug water to drink around the river, for they were not able to drink from the waters of the river.
\ts\*
\p
\v 25 And seven days were filled after Yahweh struck the river.

\c 8
\p
\v 1 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh, and you shall say to him, ‘Thus says Yahweh: “Let my people go, and they shall serve me.
\v 2 And if you refuse to let go, behold! I am about to strike all your territory with frogs.
\v 3 And frogs will swarm the river, and they will climb, and they will go into your house and in the room of your bed and on your bed and into the house of your servants and among your people and in your ovens and in your kneading bowls,
\v 4 and the frogs will climb on you and on your people and on all your servants.”’”
\ts\*
\p
\v 5 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Reach out your hand with your staff over the canals, over the streams, and over the pools, and cause the frogs to come up on the land of Egypt.’”
\v 6 And Aaron reached out his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frog came up and covered the land of Egypt.
\v 7 And the magicians did likewise with their magic, and they brought up frogs over the land of Egypt.
\ts\*
\p
\v 8 And Pharaoh called for Moses and for Aaron, and he said, “Pray to Yahweh that he may take away the frogs from me and from my people. And I will let the people go, and they may sacrifice to Yahweh.”
\p
\v 9 And Moses said to Pharaoh, “Glorify yourself over me: when shall I pray for you and for your servants and for your people, to cause to cut off the frogs from you and from your houses? They will be left in the river only.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 10 And he said, “Tomorrow.”
\p
And he said, “Just as you say, so that you will know that there is no one like Yahweh, our God.
\v 11 And the frogs will withdraw from you and from your houses and from your servants and from your people. They will be left in the river only.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 12 And Moses and Aaron went out from being with Pharaoh. And Moses cried out to Yahweh concerning the matter of the frogs that he had set on Pharaoh.
\v 13 And Yahweh did according to the word of Moses: and the frogs died off from the houses, from the courts, and from the fields.
\v 14 And they gathered them into many piles, and the land stank.
\v 15 And Pharaoh saw that there was a respite, and he caused his heart to be heavy, and he did not listen to them, just as Yahweh had said.
\ts\*
\p
\v 16 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the ground, and it will become lice in all the land of Egypt.’”
\v 17 And they did so, and Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff and he struck the dust of the ground, and it became lice on man and on beast. All the dust of the ground was lice in all the land of Egypt.
\ts\*
\v 18 And the magicians did so with their magic to bring out lice, but they were not able. And there were lice on man and beast.
\p
\v 19 And the magicians said to Pharaoh, “It is the finger of God.” And the heart of Pharaoh was strong, and he did not listen to them, just as Yahweh said.
\ts\*
\p
\v 20 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Rise early in the morning and station yourself before the face of Pharaoh. Behold, he goes out to the waters. And you shall say to him, ‘Thus says Yahweh: “Let my people go, and they will serve me.
\v 21 Surely if you do not immediately send my people out, behold me! I am about to send the swarm at you and at your servants and at your people and into your houses. And the houses of Egypt will be full of the swarm, and even the ground which they are on.
\ts\*
\v 22 And in that day, I will distinguish the land of Goshen, on which my people dwell, so that the swarm will not be there, in order that you may know that I am Yahweh in the middle of the land.
\v 23 And I will put redemption between my people and between your people. This sign will happen tomorrow.”’”
\v 24 And Yahweh did so, and a heavy swarm came to the house of Pharaoh and the houses of his servants and all the land of Egypt. The land was ruined from the face of the swarm.
\ts\*
\p
\v 25 And Pharaoh called to Moses and to Aaron and said, “Go, sacrifice to your God in the land.”
\p
\v 26 And Moses said, “It would not be right to do so, because we will sacrifice an abomination of the Egyptians to Yahweh our God. Look, we would sacrifice an abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and would they not stone us?
\v 27 We must travel a journey of three days into the wilderness, and we will sacrifice to Yahweh our God, just as he is saying to us.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 28 And Pharaoh said, “I will let you go and sacrifice to Yahweh your God in the wilderness; only you may certainly not go very far. Pray for me.”
\p
\v 29 And Moses said, “Behold, I am about to go out from with you. And I shall pray to Yahweh, and he will withdraw the swarm from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people tomorrow. Only may Pharaoh not continue to deceive in order to fail to let the people go to sacrifice to Yahweh.”
\ts\*
\v 30 And Moses went out from with Pharaoh and prayed to Yahweh.
\v 31 And Yahweh did according to the word of Moses, and he withdrew the swarm from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people. Not one remained.
\v 32 And Pharaoh caused his heart to be heavy at this time also, and he did not let the people go.
\ts\*


\c 9
\p
\v 1 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Go in to Pharaoh and speak to him: ‘Thus says Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews: “Let my people go, and they shall serve me.
\v 2 Surely if you are unwilling to let go, but are still holding on to them,
\v 3 behold! The hand of Yahweh is about to be on your livestock which are in the field, on the horses, on the donkeys, on the camels, on the cattle, and on the flock—an exceedingly heavy plague.
\v 4 And Yahweh will distinguish between the livestock of Israel and between the livestock of Egypt. And no thing will die from any of the sons of Israel.”’”
\ts\*
\p
\v 5 And Yahweh set an appointment, saying, “Tomorrow Yahweh will do this thing in the land.”
\v 6 And Yahweh did this thing the next day, and all of the livestock of Egypt died. But from the livestock of the sons of Israel not one died.
\v 7 And Pharaoh sent, and, behold, not even one of the livestock of Israel had died. But the heart of Pharaoh was heavy, and he did not let the people go.
\ts\*
\p
\v 8 And Yahweh said to Moses and to Aaron, “Take to you a fullness of both your hands of ash of a furnace. And Moses shall sprinkle it toward heaven before the eyes of Pharaoh.
\v 9 And it will become powder over all the land of Egypt. And it will become boils, bursting blisters, on man and on beast in all the land of Egypt.”
\v 10 And they took ash of a furnace, and they stood before the face of Pharaoh. And Moses sprinkled it toward the heavens, and it became boils, bursting blisters, on man and on beast.
\ts\*
\v 11 And the magicians were not able to stand before the face of Moses, because of the face of the boils, because boils were on the magicians and on all of Egypt.
\v 12 But Yahweh strengthened the heart of Pharaoh, and he did not listen to them, just as Yahweh had said to Moses.
\ts\*
\p
\v 13 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Rise early in the morning, and stand before the face of Pharaoh, and say to him, ‘Thus says Yahweh, the God of the Hebrews: “Let my people go, and they shall serve me.
\v 14 For this time I am about to send all my plagues to your heart, and on your servants, and on your people, in order that you may know that there is nothing like me in all the earth.
\ts\*
\v 15 For now I could have stretched out my hand and struck you and your people with a plague, and you would have been destroyed from the land.
\v 16 However, for this reason I appointed you: in order to show you my power and in order to proclaim my name in all the earth.
\v 17 You are still exalting yourself against my people by failing to let them go.
\ts\*
\v 18 Behold me! I am about to cause extremely heavy hail to rain tomorrow at this time, which there has never been anything like in Egypt from the day it was founded until now.
\v 19 And now send and bring to safety your livestock and all that is yours in the field, and the hail will come down on every man and beast that is found in the field and was not gathered to the house, and they will die.”’”
\ts\*
\p
\v 20 The fearers of the word of Yahweh from the servants of Pharaoh made their slaves and their livestock run to the houses,
\v 21 but whoever did not set his heart to the word of Yahweh left his slaves and his livestock in the field.
\ts\*
\p
\v 22 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Reach out your hand toward the heavens, and there will be hail in all the land of Egypt, on man and on beast and on every plant of the field in the land of Egypt.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 23 And Moses stretched his staff to the heavens, and Yahweh gave thunder and hail, and fire darted to the land. And Yahweh rained hail on the land of Egypt.
\v 24 And there was hail and fire coming in the middle of the hail; {it was} very heavy, such as it had never been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation.
\v 25 And the hail hit everything in the land of Egypt, everything which was in the field, from man to beast. And the hail struck every plant of the field, and it broke every tree of the field.
\v 26 Only in the land of Goshen, where the sons of Israel were, there was no hail.
\ts\*
\p
\v 27 And Pharaoh sent, and he called for Moses and for Aaron. And he said to them, “I have sinned this time. Yahweh is righteous, and I and my people are guilty.
\v 28 Pray to Yahweh, for the thunder of God and hail are too much. And I will let you go, and you will not continue to stay.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 29 And Moses said to him, “As I leave the city, I will spread my palms to Yahweh. The thunder will cease, and the hail will not continue, so that you may know that the earth belongs to Yahweh.
\v 30 But you and your servants, I know that you are not yet afraid of the face of Yahweh God.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 31 (And the flax and the barley were struck down, for the barley was in ear, and the flax was in bloom.
\v 32 But the wheat and the spelt were not struck down, for they are late.)
\ts\*
\p
\v 33 And Moses left the city from being with Pharaoh, and he spread his palms to Yahweh, and the thunder and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured on the earth.
\v 34 And Pharaoh saw that the rain and hail and thunder ceased, and he added to his sin, and he caused his heart to be heavy, he and his servants.
\v 35 And the heart of Pharaoh was strong, and he did not let the sons of Israel go, just as Yahweh had said by the hand of Moses.
\ts\*


\c 10
\p
\v 1 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Go in to Pharaoh, for I have made his heart and the heart of his servants heavy, in order to perform these my signs in his midst,
\v 2 and so that you may proclaim in the ears of your son and the son of your son that I toyed with Egypt, and my signs which I performed among them—and you will know that I am Yahweh.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 3 And Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh and said to him, “Thus says Yahweh, God of the Hebrews: ‘Until when will you refuse to be humble from my face? Let my people go, and they will serve me.
\v 4 For if you refuse to let my people go, behold me, I am about to bring locust within your borders tomorrow.
\ts\*
\v 5 And it will cover the sight of the land, and none will be able to see the land. And it will devour the remnant of whatever escaped, of whatever is left to you from the hail. And it will devour every tree growing for you from the field.
\v 6 And they will fill your houses and the houses of all your servants and the houses of all the Egyptians, which your fathers had never seen, nor the fathers of your fathers, from the day they came to be on the earth until this day.’” And he turned around and left from being with Pharaoh.
\ts\*
\p
\v 7 And the servants of Pharaoh said to him, “Until when will this be a trap to us? Let the men go and they will serve Yahweh their God. Do you not understand yet that Egypt has perished?”
\p
\v 8 And Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh, and he said to them, “Go serve Yahweh your God. Who and who shall go?”
\ts\*
\p
\v 9 And Moses said, “We shall go with our young and with our old. We shall go with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and our herds, because the festival of Yahweh is for us.”
\p
\v 10 And he said to them, “May Yahweh be with you in the same way as I will let you and your children go. See, for evil is before your faces!
\v 11 Not so! You may go, the men, and serve Yahweh, because this is what you are seeking.” And he drove them from the face of Pharaoh.
\ts\*
\p
\v 12 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt with the locust, and let it rise up over the land of Egypt, and let it devour all of the plants of the land, everything which the hail had spared.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 13 And Moses reached out his staff over the land of Egypt, and Yahweh drove an east wind over the land all that day and all night. The morning was, and the east wind had brought the locust.
\v 14 And the locust rose up over all the land of Egypt and came to rest everywhere within the borders of Egypt. They were extremely numerous. Never before was there such locust like it, and nothing will be like it after.
\v 15 And it covered the sight of all of the land, and the land was dark. And it devoured all of the plants of the land and all of the fruit of the trees that the hail had left. And not any of the greenery remained in a tree or in a plant of the field in all of the land of Egypt.
\ts\*
\p
\v 16 And Pharaoh hurried to call for Moses and for Aaron and said, “I have sinned against Yahweh your God and against you.
\v 17 And now, please bear my sin, just this once, and pray to Yahweh your God and let him take this death only away from me.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 18 And he went out from being with Pharaoh, and he prayed to Yahweh.
\v 19 And Yahweh turned a very strong sea wind, and it carried away the locust, and it drove it into the Sea of Reeds; not one locust remained in all of the territory of Egypt.
\v 20 And Yahweh strengthened the heart of Pharaoh, and he did not let the sons of Israel go.
\ts\*
\p
\v 21 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward the heavens, and let it become dark over the land of Egypt, and darkness will feel.”
\v 22 And Moses stretched out his hand above the heavens, and dark darkness was in all of the land of Egypt for three days.
\v 23 No man could see his brother, and no man rose from his place for three days. But for all the sons of Israel, there was light in their dwelling-places.
\ts\*
\p
\v 24 And Pharaoh called to Moses, and he said, “Go serve Yahweh. Only your flocks and your herds must remain behind; however, your children will go with you.”
\p
\v 25 And Moses said, “Also you, you must give in our hands sacrifices and burnt offerings, and we will do to Yahweh our God.
\v 26 And even our livestock shall go with us. Not a hoof shall be left behind, for we shall take from them to serve Yahweh our God. And as for us, we will not know with what we must serve Yahweh until we arrive there.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 27 And Yahweh strengthened the heart of Pharaoh, and he would not agree to let them go.
\v 28 And Pharaoh said to him, “Get away from me! Watch yourself; you shall not again see my face; because in the day of your seeing my face, you shall die.”
\p
\v 29 And Moses said, “Just as you say, I will not ever see your face again.”

\c 11
\p
\v 1 And Yahweh said to Moses, “One more plague I will bring on Pharaoh and on Egypt. After that he will let you go from here. As soon as he lets go, he will certainly drive you completely away from here.
\v 2 Speak now in the ears of the people, and let them ask, a man from his neighbor and a woman from her neighbor, items of silver and items of gold.”
\v 3 And Yahweh gave the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians. Furthermore, the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the eyes of the servants of Pharaoh and in the eyes of the people.

\ts\*
\p
\v 4 And Moses said, “Thus says Yahweh: ‘About the middle of the night I will go out in the midst of Egypt,
\v 5 and every firstborn in the land of Egypt will die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh, who sits on his throne, to the firstborn of the slave girl who is behind the mill, and every firstborn of a beast.

\ts\*
\v 6 And there will be a great cry in all the land of Egypt, which nothing like it has ever happened, and nothing like it will happen again.
\v 7 But to each of the sons of Israel, a dog will not sharpen his tongue, from man to beast, so that you will know that Yahweh distinguishes between Egypt and between Israel.’
\v 8 And all your servants, these will come down to me, and they will bow to me, saying, ‘Go, you and all the people who are at your feet!’ And after that I will go out.” And he went out from Pharaoh with burning of the nose.

\ts\*
\p
\v 9 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Pharaoh will not listen to you, in order to multiply my miracles in the land of Egypt.”
\v 10 And Moses and Aaron did all these miracles before the face of Pharaoh. But Yahweh strengthened the heart of Pharaoh, and he did not let the sons of Israel go from his land.

\c 12
\p
\v 1 And Yahweh said to Moses and to Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying,
\v 2 “This month is to you the head of the months. It is the first to you of the months of the year.
\ts\*
\v 3 Speak to all the congregation of Israel, saying, ‘On the tenth of this month they shall take to themselves, each man, a lamb to the house of the fathers: a lamb to a house.
\v 4 And if the household is too few for having a lamb, then he and his neighbor near to his house by the number of people shall take the lamb; according to the eating of the mouth of each man you shall calculate it.
\v 5 Your lamb shall be complete, male, the son of a year. You may take from the sheep or from the goats.
\ts\*
\v 6 And it shall be to you to reserve until the fourteenth day of this month. And all the assembly of the congregation of Israel shall slaughter it between the evenings.
\v 7 And they shall take from the blood and put it on the two doorposts and on the lintel of the houses in which they eat it.
\v 8 And they shall eat the flesh that night, roast of fire, and they shall eat unleavened bread over bitter herbs.
\ts\*
\v 9 You shall not eat from it raw or boiled from boiling in water. But instead, roasted of fire, its head with its legs and with its internal organs.
\v 10 And you shall not cause to remain anything from it until morning; and you shall burn in the fire what remains from it until morning.
\v 11 And this is how you shall eat it: belts fastened on your waist, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand. And you shall eat it with haste. It is the Passover to Yahweh.
\ts\*
\p
\v 12 And I will pass through the land of Egypt on that night, and I will strike all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from man to beast. And I will bring judgment on all the gods of Egypt. I am Yahweh.
\v 13 And the blood will be a sign for you on the houses which you are in. And I will see the blood, and I will pass over above you, and the plague will not be on you for destruction as my striking on the land of Egypt.
\ts\*
\p
\v 14 And this day shall become a memorial for you, and you shall celebrate it as a festival to Yahweh for your generations—a statute you shall celebrate forever.
\v 15 You shall eat unleavened bread for seven days. Yes—on the first day you shall remove yeast from your houses, because anyone who eats leavened bread from the first day until the seventh day, that person shall be cut off from Israel.
\v 16 And on the first day an assembly of holiness, and on the seventh day an assembly of holiness shall be for you. All work shall not be done in these, except what each person eats, that alone may be done by you.
\ts\*
\p
\v 17 And you shall keep the Unleavened Bread, because on this very day I will have brought out your hosts from the land of Egypt. And you shall keep this day throughout your generations, a statute forever.
\v 18 In the first month, on the fourteenth day in the evening you shall eat unleavened bread until the twenty-first day of the month in the evening.
\v 19 For seven days no yeast shall be found in your houses. Because anyone who eats yeasted bread, that person shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel—among the sojourner or among the native of the land.
\v 20 You shall not eat any yeast; in all of your dwelling places you shall eat unleavened bread.’”
\ts\*
\p
\v 21 And Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and he said to them, “Proceed and take a lamb for yourself, according to your families, and slaughter the Passover.
\v 22 And you shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin and apply to the lintel and to both the doorposts from the blood that is in the basin. And you, not a man shall go out from the door of his house until morning.
\v 23 And Yahweh will pass through to strike the Egyptians. And he will see the blood on the lintel and on the two doorposts, and Yahweh will pass over the door and will not permit the causer of destruction to enter into your houses to strike.
\ts\*
\p
\v 24 And you shall keep this thing as a statute for you and for your sons until eternity.
\v 25 And so it will happen, as you enter into the land that Yahweh will give to you, just as he said, then you shall keep this service.
\ts\*
\v 26 And it will happen, when your sons are saying to you, ‘What is this service to you?’
\v 27 then you shall say, ‘It is the sacrifice of Passover to Yahweh, who passed over the houses of the sons of Israel in Egypt in striking the Egyptians. And he rescued our households.’” And the people bowed their heads and prostrated themselves.
\v 28 And the sons of Israel went and did; as Yahweh had commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.
\ts\*
\p
\v 29 And so it happened, in the middle of the night, and Yahweh struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh sitting on his throne to the firstborn of the captive who was in the house of the pit, and all the firstborn of beasts.
\v 30 And Pharaoh got up in the night—he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians. And there was a great cry in Egypt, for there was not a house where there was not someone dead.
\ts\*
\p
\v 31 And he called for Moses and for Aaron in the night and said, “Get up, get out from among my people, both you and also the sons of Israel. And go, serve Yahweh, as you have said.
\v 32 Also take your flocks, also your herds as you have said, and go, and also bless me.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 33 And the Egyptians strengthened the people, hurrying to let them go from the land, for they said, “We are all dying.”
\v 34 And the people carried his dough before it developed leaven. Their kneading bowls were wrapped in their clothes on their shoulders.
\v 35 And the sons of Israel did according to the word of Moses. And they asked from the Egyptians items of silver and items of gold and clothing.
\v 36 And Yahweh gave the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians. And they made the request, and they plundered the Egyptians.
\ts\*
\p
\v 37 And the sons of Israel journeyed from Rameses toward Succoth, about 600, 000 strong men on foot, apart from children.
\v 38 And also a mixed multitude went up with them, and flock and herd—a very great number of livestock.
\v 39 And they baked the dough that they brought from Egypt into unleavened bread, for it was not leavened, because they were driven out of Egypt, and they could not delay. And furthermore, they had not made provisions for themselves.
\ts\*
\p
\v 40 And the residence of the sons of Israel, during which they resided in Egypt, was 430 years.
\v 41 And so it was, at the end of 430 years, it was on that very day all of the hosts of Yahweh went out from the land of Egypt.
\v 42 It was a night of observing for Yahweh to bring them out from the land of Egypt. This night, it is for all the sons of Israel to observe for Yahweh throughout their generations.
\ts\*
\p
\v 43 And Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron, “This is the statute of the Passover: Any son of foreignness shall not eat it.
\v 44 But any slave of a man, a purchase of silver, if you circumcised him, then he may eat it.
\v 45 An outsider or a hireling shall not eat it.
\ts\*
\v 46 It shall be eaten in one house. You shall not bring from the house from the flesh to the outside, and you shall not break its bone.
\v 47 All the congregation of Israel shall do it.
\ts\*
\p
\v 48 And if a sojourner is sojourning with you, and keeps the Passover to Yahweh, all his males shall be circumcised. And then he may draw near to keep it, and he will become like a native of the land. And any uncircumcised person shall not eat it.
\v 49 One law shall be for the native and for the sojourner sojourning among you.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 50 And all of the sons of Israel did—just as Yahweh commanded Moses and Aaron—so they did.
\v 51 And so it was, in that very day, Yahweh brought the sons of Israel out from the land of Egypt by their hosts.
\ts\*


\c 13

\v 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 2 “Set apart to me all the firstborn, openers of every womb among the sons of Israel, among man and among beast; he is mine.”

\p
\v 3 And Moses said to the people, “Remember this day, that you went out from Egypt, from the house of slavery, because by a strong hand Yahweh brought you out from here. And no yeast may be eaten.
\v 4 Today you are going out, in the month of Aviv.
\ts\*
\v 5 And it will be that Yahweh will bring you to the land of the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Amorite and the Hivite and the Jebusite, which he swore to your fathers to give to you, a land flowing with milk and honey—and you shall serve this service in this month.
\v 6 Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day {there shall be} a festival to Yahweh.
\v 7 Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days, and leavened bread may not be seen among you. And yeast may not be seen among you within any of your borders.
\ts\*
\p
\v 8 And you shall tell your son on that day, saying, ‘This is because of what Yahweh did for me when I came out from Egypt.’
\v 9 And it shall be a sign for you on your hand and a memorial between your eyes, so that the law of Yahweh may be in your mouth, for with a strong hand Yahweh brought you out from Egypt.
\v 10 And you shall keep this statute at its appointed time from days to days.
\ts\*
\p
\v 11 And it will be, when Yahweh brings you into the land of the Canaanites, as he swore to you and to your fathers, and he gives it to you,
\v 12 then cause to pass over to Yahweh all the openers of the womb, and all the openers of the litter of beasts that are yours. The males are for Yahweh.
\v 13 And every opener of a donkey you shall ransom with a lamb. And if you do not ransom it, then you shall break his neck. And all the firstborn of men among your sons, you shall ransom.
\ts\*
\p
\v 14 And so it will be, when your son asks you later, saying, ‘What is this?’ then you shall say to him, ‘With a strong hand Yahweh brought us out from Egypt, from the house of slaves.’
\v 15 And so it was, that when Pharaoh was hard to let us go, then Yahweh struck all of the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of man and to the firstborn of beast. That is why I sacrifice to Yahweh all the openers of the womb—the males—and I ransom all of the firstborn of my sons.’
\v 16 And it shall be a sign on your hand and a headband between your eyes, for with a strong hand Yahweh brought us out from Egypt.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 17 And so it was, when Pharaoh let the people go, that God did not lead them by way of the land of the Philistines, although it was nearby. For God said, “Lest the people repent when they see war and return to Egypt.”
\v 18 And God caused the people to turn to the way of the wilderness, to the Sea of Reeds. And the sons of Israel went up from the land of Egypt by fives.
\ts\*
\p
\v 19 And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for he had certainly caused the sons of Israel to vow, saying, “God will certainly attend to you, and you shall bring my bones up with you from here.”
\ts\*

\v 20 And they journeyed from Succoth, and they camped at Etham on the edge of the wilderness.
\v 21 And Yahweh went before their faces by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them on the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to be light to them, to go by day or by night.
\v 22 He did not withdraw the daytime pillar of cloud or the nighttime pillar of fire from the face of the people.
\ts\*


\c 14
\p
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 2 “Say to the sons of Israel that they should turn and camp before the face of Pi Hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, before the face of Baal Zephon. You are to camp by the sea opposite it.
\v 3 And Pharaoh will say about the sons of Israel, ‘They are confused in the land. The wilderness has closed in on them.’
\v 4 And I will strengthen the heart of Pharaoh, and he will pursue after them. And I will be glorified because of Pharaoh and because of all his army. And the Egyptians will know that I am Yahweh.” And they did so.
\ts\*
\p
\v 5 And the king of Egypt was told that the people fled, and the heart of Pharaoh and his servants was turned to the people. And they said, “What is this we did that we released Israel from our slavery?”
\v 6 And he hitched his chariot and took his people with him.
\v 7 And he took 600 chosen chariots, and all of the chariots of Egypt, and third men were on all of them.
\ts\*
\v 8 And Yahweh strengthened the heart of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and he pursued after the sons of Israel, and the sons of Israel were going out with a high hand.
\v 9 And the Egyptians pursued after them. And all of the horses of the chariots of Pharaoh and his horsemen and his army overtook them camping above the sea, above Pi Hahiroth before the face of Baal Zephon.
\ts\*
\p
\v 10 And Pharaoh approached, and the sons of Israel lifted their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians started after them, and they were extremely afraid. And the sons of Israel cried to Yahweh.
\v 11 And they said to Moses, “Is it because there were not any graves in Egypt that you have taken us away to die in the wilderness? What is this you have done to us, to bring us out from Egypt?
\v 12 Is this not the word that we spoke to you in Egypt, saying, ‘Cease from us and let us serve the Egyptians’? Because serving the Egyptians is better to us than dying in the wilderness.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 13 And Moses said to the people, “You must not fear! Stand still and see the salvation of Yahweh, that he will do for you today. For the Egyptians whom you see today you will not repeat seeing again until eternity.
\v 14 Yahweh himself will fight for you. As for you, you will be silent.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 15 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Why are you crying out to me? Speak to the sons of Israel and let them start moving.
\v 16 As for you, raise your staff and reach out your hand over the sea and split it. And the sons of Israel will enter into the midst of the sea on dry ground.
\v 17 And behold me! I will strengthen the heart of the Egyptians, and they will enter after them. And I will be glorified because of Pharaoh and because of all his army, because of his chariots and because of his horsemen.
\v 18 And the Egyptians will know that I am Yahweh when I am glorified because of Pharaoh, because of his chariots and because of his horsemen.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 19 And the angel of God moved, who traveled before the face of the camp of Israel and went behind them. And the pillar of cloud moved from before their face and stood behind them.
\v 20 And it came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel. And it became a cloud, and darkness, and it lit up the night, and one did not come near to the other all night.
\ts\*
\v 21 And Moses reached out his hand over the sea. And Yahweh drove the sea by a strong east wind all night and made the sea into dry land. And the waters were divided.
\v 22 And the sons of Israel entered the middle of the sea on dry ground. And the waters were a wall for them on their right and on their left.
\ts\*
\p
\v 23 And the Egyptians pursued, and entered after them—every horse of Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen—into the middle of the sea.
\v 24 And so it was, in the watch of the morning, Yahweh looked down on the camp of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and cloud. And he confused the camp of the Egyptians.
\v 25 And he caused the wheels of their chariots to turn aside and caused them to drive heavily. And the Egyptians said, “Let us run from the face of Israel, for Yahweh is fighting for them against Egypt.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 26 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Reach out your hand over the sea, and the waters will return on the Egyptians, on his chariots, and on his horsemen.”
\v 27 And Moses reached out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned before the face of the morning to its normal place, and the Egyptians fled before its impact. And Yahweh shook off the Egyptians in the middle of the sea.
\v 28 And the waters returned, and they covered the chariots and the horsemen, even the entire army of Pharaoh that entered after them into the sea. Not even one of them remained.
\ts\*
\p
\v 29 And the sons of Israel walked on dry land in the middle of the sea. And the waters were a wall for them on their right and on their left.
\v 30 And Yahweh saved Israel that day from the hand of Egypt, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the shore of the sea.
\v 31 And Israel saw the great hand that Yahweh used against the Egyptians, and the people feared Yahweh, and they believed in Yahweh and in his servant Moses.

\p
\v 1 Then Moses and the sons of Israel sang this song to Yahweh. And they said, saying,
\q “Let me sing to Yahweh, for he has triumphantly triumphed;

\ts\*
\q
\v 2 Yah is my strength and my song,
\q and he has become my salvation.
\q This is my God, and I will glorify him,

\v 3 Yahweh is a man of war;
\q Yahweh is his name.

\q
\v 4 He threw the chariots of Pharaoh and his army into the sea.

\v 5 The deeps cover them;

\q
\v 6 Your right hand, Yahweh, is majestic in power;

\v 7 And in the abundance of your majesty you overthrow those who rise up against you.
\q You send out your heat; it devours them like stubble.

\v 8 And by the breath of your nostrils the waters were piled up;

\v 9 The enemy said,

\v 10 You blew with your wind; the sea covered them;

\q
\v 11 Who is like you among the gods Yahweh?
\q Who is like you, majestic in holiness,

\v 12 You reached out your right hand,

\v 14 The peoples heard; they shake;

\v 15 Then the chiefs of Edom panicked;
\q trembling seizes the leaders of Moab;

\v 16 Terror and dread fall on them.

\q By the greatness of your arm, they are still as a stone

\ts\*
\p
\v 19 For the horse of Pharaoh went with his chariots and horsemen into the sea. And Yahweh returned upon them the waters of the sea. And the sons of Israel walked on dry land in the middle of the sea.
\v 20 And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a tambourine in her hand, and all the women went out after her with tambourines and with dancing.
\v 21 And Miriam responded to them:
\q1 “Sing to Yahweh, for he has triumphed triumphantly;
\q1 the horse and the one riding it he threw into the sea.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 22 And Moses caused Israel to set out from the Sea of Reeds. And they went out into the Wilderness of Shur. And they traveled for three days into the wilderness, and they found no water.
\v 23 And they came to Marah, and they were not able to drink the waters of Marah, because they were bitter. So he called its name Marah.
\ts\*
\v 24 And the people murmured against Moses, saying, “What can we drink?”
\v 25 And he cried out to Yahweh, and Yahweh showed him a tree. And he threw it into the water, and the water became sweet. There he gave him a statute and an ordinance, and there he tested him.
\v 26 And he said, “If you carefully listen to the voice of Yahweh your God, and you do what is right in his eyes, and you give ear to his commands and you keep all of his laws, all of the diseases that I put on the Egyptians I shall not put on you, for I am Yahweh your healer.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 27 And they came to Elim, and there were 12 springs of water and 70 palm trees there. And they camped there by the water.
\c 16
\p
\v 1 And they journeyed on from Elim, and all of the congregation of the sons of Israel entered into the Wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departure from the land of Egypt.
\ts\*
\v 2 And all the congregation of the sons of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness.
\v 3 And the sons of Israel said to them, “If only we had died by the hand of Yahweh in the land of Egypt, sitting by a pot of meat, eating bread to the full. For you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 4 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Behold me make bread rain down from heaven for you. And the people shall go out and gather the portion of a day each day, so that I may test them: Will they walk in my law or not?
\v 5 And so it will be, on the sixth day, that they shall prepare what they bring in, and that will be twice as much as what they gather daily.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 6 And Moses and Aaron said to all of the sons of Israel, “At evening you will know that Yahweh brought you out from the land of Egypt.
\v 7 In the morning you will see the glory of Yahweh in his hearing your murmurings against Yahweh. And who are we that you murmur against us?”
\v 8 And Moses said, “So Yahweh gives you meat to eat in the evening and bread in the morning to satiation; Yahweh is hearing your murmurings that you murmur against him. And what are we? Not against us is your murmuring, but against Yahweh.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 9 And Moses said to Aaron, “Say to all of the congregation of the sons of Israel, ‘Approach the face of Yahweh, for he has heard your murmurings.’”
\v 10 And so it was, as Aaron spoke to all of the congregation of the sons of Israel, that they turned toward the wilderness, and behold! the glory of Yahweh appeared in the cloud!
\ts\*
\p
\v 11 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 12 “I have heard the murmurings of the sons of Israel. Speak to them saying, ‘Between the evenings you will eat meat, and in the morning you will be satisfied with bread. And you will know that I am Yahweh your God.’”
\ts\*
\p
\v 13 And so it was, in the evening quail came up and covered the camp. And in the morning the dew was lying round about the camp.
\v 14 And the lying dew went up; and behold! on the face of the wilderness were thin flakes, thin like frost on the ground.
\v 15 And the sons of Israel saw it, and they said each man to his brother, “What is it?” Because they did not know what it was.
\ts\*
\p
And Moses said to them, “It is the bread that Yahweh has given you to eat.
\v 16 This is the thing that Yahweh has commanded: ‘Gather from it each according to the mouths of his eating; an omer for each person up to the number of your people, each shall take for those in his tent.’”
\v 17 And the sons of Israel did so. And they gathered much, or little,
\v 18 and they measured it by omer. And there was no extra for those with much, and no lack for those with little. Each man gathered according to what he needed to eat.
\ts\*
\p
\v 19 And Moses said to them, “A man shall not save any of it until morning.”
\v 20 But they did not listen to Moses. And men reserved some of it until morning, and it bred worms, and it stank. And Moses became angry with them.
\v 21 And they gathered it morning by morning, each man according to the mouths of his eating. And the sun became hot, and it melted.
\ts\*
\p
\v 22 And so it was, on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each person. And all the leaders of the community came and told Moses.
\v 23 And he said to them, “This is what Yahweh spoke: ‘Tomorrow is a rest, a Sabbath of holiness to Yahweh. What you are baking—bake! and what you are cooking—cook! And all of the leftovers cause to rest, for preservation for yourselves until morning.’”
\ts\*
\p
\v 24 And they left it until morning, as Moses had instructed. And it did not become foul, and no worms were in it.
\v 25 And Moses said, “Eat it today, for it is Sabbath, a day for Yahweh, a day you will not find it in the fields.
\v 26 You shall gather it for six days, and on the seventh day, Sabbath, there will be none of it.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 27 And so it was, on the seventh day, some of the people went out to gather, but they found none.
\v 28 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Until what time will you refuse to keep my commandments and my laws?
\v 29 Look! For Yahweh has given you the Sabbath. So on the sixth day he is giving you bread for two days. Each one stay where he is; a man shall not be going out from his place on the seventh day.”
\v 30 And the people rested on the seventh day.
\ts\*
\p
\v 31 And the house of Israel called its name “manna.” And it was like coriander seed, white, and its taste was like wafers with honey.
\v 32 And Moses said, “This is the procedure that Yahweh has commanded: ‘A full omer of it for preservation for your descendants so that they can see the bread which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out from the land of Egypt.’”
\ts\*
\p
\v 33 And Moses said to Aaron, “Take one pot and put there a full omer of manna. Put it before the face of Yahweh, for preservation for your descendants.”
\v 34 Just as Yahweh commanded to Moses, so Aaron put it before the face of the Covenant, for preservation.
\v 35 And the sons of Israel ate manna 40 years, until they came to inhabited land. They ate manna until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan.
\v 36 (And an omer, it is a tenth of an ephah.)
\ts\*


\c 17
\p
\v 1 And all the community of the sons of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, journeying at the mouth of Yahweh. And they camped at Rephidim, and there was no water for the people to drink.
\v 2 And the people quarreled with Moses, and they said, “Give us water to drink.”
\p
And Moses said to them, “Why are you quarreling with me? Why do you test Yahweh?”
\p
\v 3 And the people were thirsty for water there, and the people murmured against Moses. And he said, “Is this why you brought us up from Egypt? To kill me and my sons and my cattle, with thirst?”
\ts\*
\p
\v 4 And Moses cried out to Yahweh, saying, “What should I do for this people? A little longer and they will stone me.”
\p
\v 5 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Pass before the face of the people, and take with you some of the elders of Israel, and your staff, the one with which you struck the river, take in your hand; and go.
\v 6 Behold me! I will stand before your face there on the rock at Horeb. And you will strike on the rock, and water will come from it, and the people will drink.” And Moses did so in the eyes of the elders of Israel.
\ts\*
\v 7 And he called the name of the place Massah and Meribah, for the conflict of the sons of Israel and for their testing of Yahweh by saying, “Is Yahweh among us or not?”
\ts\*
\p
\v 8 And Amalek came and fought with Israel at Rephidim.
\v 9 And Moses said to Joshua, “Choose men for us and go out. Fight with Amalek. Tomorrow I will be stationed on top of the hill, and the staff of God will be in my hand.”
\v 10 And Joshua did as Moses said to him, to fight Amalek.
\ts\*
\p
And Moses, Aaron, and Hur climbed up to the top of the hill.
\v 11 And so it was, when Moses raised his hand, then Israel would be winning, and when he set his hand down, then Amalek would be winning.
\v 12 And the hands of Moses became heavy. And they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it, and Aaron and Hur held his hands up, one from this, and one from that. And so his hands were steady until the sun went down.
\v 13 And Joshua defeated Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.
\ts\*
\p
\v 14 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Write this memory in the book and put it in the ears of Joshua, because I will certainly blot out the memory of Amalek from under the skies.”
\v 15 And Moses built an altar, and he called its name “Yahweh is my banner.”
\v 16 And he said, “Because a hand was against the throne of Yah, war is to Yahweh against Amalek from generation to generation.”
\ts\*


\c 18
\p
\v 1 And Jethro, the priest of Midian, father-in-law of Moses, heard all that God had done for Moses and for Israel his people; that Yahweh brought Israel out from Egypt.
\ts\*
\v 2 And Jethro, father-in-law of Moses, took Zipporah, wife of Moses, after he had sent her back,
\v 3 and her two sons; one of whose names was Gershom, for he had said, “I have been a sojourner in a foreign land.”
\v 4 And the name of the other was Eliezer, for “The God of my father was my helper. And he rescued me from the sword of Pharaoh.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 5 And Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses, came, and his sons and his wife, to Moses, to the wilderness where he was camping, at the mountain of God.
\v 6 And he said to Moses, “I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you, and your wife, and her two sons with her.”
\ts\*
\v 7 And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and he bowed down and kissed him. And they asked, each man his friend, of their welfare, and they went into the tent.
\v 8 And Moses related to his father-in-law all that Yahweh had done to Pharaoh and to Egypt on account of Israel, all the hardship that found them along the way, and of Yahweh rescuing them.
\ts\*
\p
\v 9 And Jethro rejoiced over all the good that Yahweh had done for Israel, whom he rescued from the hand of Egypt.
\v 10 And Jethro said, “Bless Yahweh, who rescued you out of the hand of Egypt and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who rescued the people from under the hand of Egypt.
\v 11 Now I know that Yahweh is greater than all the gods, because of the affair {in} which they acted proudly against them.”
\ts\*
\v 12 And Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses, took a burnt offering and sacrifices to God. And Aaron came, and all of the elders of Israel, to eat bread before the face of God with the father-in-law of Moses.
\ts\*
\p
\v 13 And so it happened the next day that Moses sat down to judge the people. And the people stood around Moses from morning until evening.
\v 14 And the father-in-law of Moses was watching all that he did for the people, and he said, “What is this thing that you are doing with the people? For what purpose do you sit alone, and all the people position themselves next to you from morning until evening?”
\ts\*
\p
\v 15 And Moses said to his father-in-law, “Because the people come to me to inquire of God.
\v 16 When a situation comes up among them, someone comes to me. And I judge between a man and his associate, and I help them understand the statutes of God and his laws.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 17 And the father-in-law of Moses said to him, “The thing which you are doing is not good.
\v 18 You will certainly wear yourself out, both you and also these people who are with you, because the thing is too heavy for you. You are not able to do it alone.
\ts\*
\v 19 Now, listen to my voice. I will advise you, and God will be with you. You be before God for the people, and you should bring their disputes to God yourself.
\v 20 And you should teach them the statutes and the laws. And you should cause them to know the way they should walk in and the work that they should do.
\ts\*
\v 21 And you yourself should search out from all of the people men of ability, fearers of God, men of faithfulness, haters of dishonest profit. And you should appoint over them: leaders of thousands, leaders of hundreds, leaders of fifties, and leaders of tens.
\v 22 And they will judge the people at all times. And so it will be, every great situation they will bring to you, and every small situation they will judge themselves. And you must lighten {this thing} from on you! And they will carry alongside you.
\v 23 If you do this thing, and God instructs you, then you will be able to endure, and furthermore, all of this people will go to its place in peace.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 24 And Moses listened to the voice of his father-in-law and did everything that he had said.
\v 25 And Moses chose men of ability from all Israel, and he appointed them heads over the people, leaders of thousands, leaders of hundreds, leaders of fifties, and leaders of tens.
\v 26 And they judged the people at all times. They brought the difficult situations to Moses, and they judged each small situation themselves.
\ts\*
\p
\v 27 And Moses let his father-in-law go, and he went into his own land.

\c 19
\p
\v 1 In the third month from the people of Israel exiting the land of Egypt, on the same day, they entered the wilderness of Sinai.
\v 2 And they departed from Rephidim, and they entered the wilderness of Sinai, and they camped in the wilderness. And Israel camped there in front of the mountain.

\ts\*
\p
\v 3 And Moses went up to God, and Yahweh called to him from the mountain, saying, “Thus you shall speak to the house of Jacob, and you shall tell the sons of Israel:
\v 4 ‘You yourselves saw what I did to the Egyptians, how I carried you on the wings of eagles and brought you to myself.
\v 5 And now, if you listen intently to my voice and keep my covenant, then you will be my possession from among all peoples. For all the earth is mine,
\v 6 and you yourselves will be my kingdom of priests and holy nation.’ These are the words that you shall speak to the sons of Israel.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 7 And Moses came and summoned the elders of the people. And he set before their faces all these words that Yahweh had commanded him.
\v 8 And all the people responded together, and they said, “We will do everything that Yahweh has said.” And Moses brought the words of the people back to Yahweh.
\ts\*
\p
\v 9 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Look, I will come to you in a thick cloud so that the people may hear when I speak with you and may also trust in you forever.” And Moses told the words of the people to Yahweh.
\ts\*
\p
\v 10 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Go to the people and make them holy today and tomorrow, and have them wash their clothing,
\v 11 and they will be prepared for the third day; for on the third day Yahweh will come down to Mount Sinai before the eyes of all the people.

\ts\*
\v 12 And you shall set boundaries for the people all around, saying, ‘Watch yourselves climbing on the mountain or touching on its edge. Every mountain toucher shall certainly be killed.
\v 13 No hand shall touch that one. Instead, he shall be stoned or he shall be shot. Whether animal or human, he shall not live.’ At the prolonged sound of the horn, they shall ascend on the mountain.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 14 And Moses went down from the mountain to the people. And he made the people holy, and they washed their clothing.
\v 15 And he said to the people, “Be prepared by the third day; you shall not come near to a woman.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 16 And it happened on the third day, when it was the morning, there were thunder and lightning and a heavy cloud on the mountain, and an extremely strong horn sound. And all the people who were in the camp were trembling.
\v 17 And Moses brought the people out from the camp to meet God, and they stationed themselves at the bottom of the mountain.
\ts\*
\v 18 And Mount Sinai smoked—all of it—because Yahweh descended on it in fire. And its smoke went up like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain trembled mightily.

\ts\*
\v 19 And it happened, the sound of the horn went very strong. Moses was speaking, and God was answering him in a voice.
\ts\*
\p
\v 20 And Yahweh descended on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain, and Yahweh called Moses to the top of the mountain. And Moses ascended.
\v 21 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Go down and warn the people lest they break through to Yahweh to see and many from them fall.
\v 22 And furthermore, the priests, the ones who come near to Yahweh, they shall make themselves holy lest Yahweh bursts out against them.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 23 And Moses said to Yahweh, “The people are not able to come up on Mount Sinai, for you yourself warned us, saying: ‘Set boundaries on the mountain and set it apart.’”
\ts\*
\p
\v 24 And Yahweh said to him, “Go, climb down. And you shall come back up, you and Aaron with you; and the priests and the people shall not break through to come up to Yahweh, lest he burst out against them.”

\p
\v 4 You shall not make for yourself a carved figure or the likeness of anything that is in heaven above or that is in the earth beneath or that is in the water under the earth.
\v 5 You shall not bow down to them and you shall not serve them, for I, Yahweh your God, am a jealous God. I visit the iniquity of the fathers on the sons on the third and on the fourth of the haters of me.
\v 6 But I show covenant faithfulness to thousands, to lovers of me and to keepers of my commandments.

\ts\*

\v 7 You shall not lift up the name of Yahweh your God with emptiness, for Yahweh will not leave unpunished anyone who lifts up my name with emptiness.

\v 8 Remember the Sabbath day, to set it apart to me.
\v 9 Six days you may labor and do all your work,
\v 10 but the seventh day is a Sabbath for Yahweh your God. You shall not do any work, you or your son or your daughter, your male servant or your female servant or your cattle or the foreigner who is within your gates.
\v 11 For in six days Yahweh made the heavens and earth, the sea, and everything that is in them, and rested on the seventh day. Therefore Yahweh blessed the Sabbath day and set it apart.

\ts\*
\p
\v 12 Honor your father and your mother, so that your days may be long on the land that Yahweh your God is giving you.

\v 13 You shall not murder.

\ts\*
\p
\v 18 All the people were seeing the thundering and the lightning and the sound of the horn and the mountain smoking. And the people saw it, and they trembled, and they stood from a distance.
\v 19 They said to Moses, “You speak to us and let us listen! But do not let God speak to us, lest we die.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 20 And Moses said to the people, “Do not be afraid, for God has come to test you so that the fear of him may be above your faces and so that you do not sin.”

\v 21 So the people stood far off, and Moses approached toward the thick darkness where God was.

\ts\*

\ts\*
\v 24 You shall make an altar of earth for me, and you shall sacrifice on it your burnt offerings, and peace offerings, sheep, and oxen. In every place where I cause my name to be remembered, I will come to you and bless you.

\v 3 If he came by himself, he shall go free by himself; if he is the husband of a wife, then his wife shall go free with him.
\ts\*
\v 4 If his master gave him a wife and she bore him sons or daughters, the wife and her children are her master’s, and he must go out by himself.
\v 5 But if the servant plainly says, “I love my master, my wife, and my children; I shall not go out free,”
\v 6 then his master shall bring him to God. He shall bring him to a door or to a doorpost, and his master shall bore his ear through with an awl. Then he shall serve him forever.

You shall make them surrounded with ornamental settings of gold.

\ts\*
\v 24 And you shall put all these on the palms of Aaron and on the palms of his sons, and you shall raise them as a raised offering before the face of Yahweh.

\v 34 And if any meat of the consecration or any of the bread remains until the morning, then you shall burn the remainder with fire. It shall not be eaten, because it is set apart.

\ts\*

\v 40 For the first lamb: a tenth of fine flour mixed with pressed oil (the fourth part of a hin) and a drink offering: the fourth part of a hin of wine.

\v 9 You shall not offer up strange incense or a burnt offering or a grain offering on it. And you shall not pour a drink offering on it.

\v 11 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 12 “When you lift up the head of the sons of Israel to count them, then each man shall give the ransom of his life to Yahweh when counting them. And there will not be a plague among them when counting them.
\v 13 Every passer over to the counted ones shall give this: half of a shekel, according to the shekel of the sanctuary (the shekel is 20 gerahs). The half shekel is an offering to Yahweh.
\ts\*
\v 14 Every passer over to the counted ones, from a son of 20 years and up, shall give the contribution of Yahweh.
\v 15 The rich shall not increase, and the poor shall not decrease from the half-shekel for giving the contribution of Yahweh to cover over your lives.

\v 17 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,

\ts\*
\v 19 And Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet in it.
\v 20 When they go into the tent of meeting, they shall wash with water, and they will not die. Also when they go near to the altar to serve by causing a fire offering to Yahweh to smoke,

\v 26 And you shall anoint with it the tent of meeting and the Box of the Testimony
\v 27 and the table and all of its utensils and the lampstand and its equipment and the altar of incense

\v 32 It shall not be poured on the body of a man, and you shall not make anything like it with its formula. It is holy; it shall be holy to you.
\v 33 A man that mixes its like or that puts any of it on a stranger shall be cut off from his people.’”

\ts\*
\p
\v 34 And Yahweh said to Moses, “Take to yourself spices—stacte, and onycha, and galbanum—spices and pure frankincense. They shall each be in equal amounts.
\v 35 And you shall make it {into} incense, an ointment, the work of an ointment mixer: salted, pure, holy.
\v 36 And you shall pulverize some of it until pulverized. And you shall put some of it before the face of the testimony in the tent of meeting, where I will meet with you. It will be a holiest holy thing to you.

\v 6 And behold, I have given with him Oholiab son of Ahisamak, from the tribe of Dan. And I have put skill into the hearts of all of the skilled of heart, and they shall make all that I have commanded you:

The profaner of it shall surely be put to death, for every worker of work on it, that person shall be cut off from his people.

\ts\*
\p
\v 18 And as he finished speaking with him on the mountain of Sinai, he gave to Moses the two tablets of the Testimony, tablets of stone, written by the finger of God.


\ts\*

\c 32
\p
\v 1 And the people saw that Moses delayed in coming down from the mountain, and the people gathered themselves around Aaron and said to him, “Arise, make gods for us that shall go before our faces, for this Moses, the man who brought us up from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him.”
\p
\v 2 And Aaron said to them, “Tear off the rings of gold that are on the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters and bring them to me.”
\v 3 And all the people tore the rings of gold off themselves that were on their ears and brought them to Aaron.
\v 4 And he took it from their hand, and fashioned it with a tool, and he made a calf of molten metal. And they said, “These are your gods, Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt.”

\ts\*
\v 5 And Aaron saw, and he built an altar before the face of it, and Aaron proclaimed and said, “Tomorrow will be a festival to Yahweh.”
\v 6 And they arose early the next day and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings. And the people sat down to eat and to drink and got up to play.

\ts\*
\p
\v 7 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, “Go! Descend! For your people, whom you brought up from the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves.
\v 8 They have quickly turned from the way that I commanded them. They have made a calf of molten metal for themselves and have bowed before it and sacrificed to it. And they have said, ‘These are your gods, Israel, that brought you up from the land of Egypt.’”

\ts\*
\v 9 And Yahweh said to Moses, “I have seen this people, and behold, it is a people hard of neck.
\v 10 So now, leave me alone! And let my nose burn against them, and I will destroy them. And I will make you into a great nation.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 11 But Moses entreated the face of Yahweh his God. And he said, “Yahweh, why does your nose burn against your people whom you have brought out from the land of Egypt with great power and with a strong hand?
\v 12 Why should the Egyptians say, saying, ‘He brought them out with evil intent, to kill them in the mountains and to destroy them from on the face of the ground’? Turn from your burning nose and repent from the evil to your people.
\v 13 Remember Abraham and Isaac and Israel, your servants that you swore to them by yourself and spoke to them, ‘I will cause your descendants to increase as the stars of the heavens, and I will give to your descendants all this land of which I have spoken. And they will inherit it forever.’”
\v 14 Then Yahweh repented from the evil that he had spoken to do to his people.

\ts\*
\p
\v 15 And Moses turned and went down from the mountain and the two tablets of the testimony {were} in his hand. The tablets were written on both their sides, on this {side} and on that {side} they were written.
\v 16 And the tablets, they {were} the work of God. And the writing, it {was} the writing of God, {it} was engraved on the tablets.

\v 17 And Joshua heard the noise of the people in its shouting, and he said to Moses, “{There is} the noise of war in the camp.”
\p
\v 18 But Moses said,
\q “There is not the sound of singing of strength,
\q and there is not the sound of singing of weakness,
\q the sound of singing I am hearing.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 19 And it happened, as he approached to the camp, that he saw the calf and dancing, and the nose of Moses burned, and he threw the tablets from his hands and shattered them under the mountain.
\v 20 And he took the calf that they had made and burned {it} in the fire and ground {it} until it was fine and scattered {it} on the face of the water and caused the sons of Israel to drink {it}.

\ts\*
\p
\v 21 And Moses said to Aaron, “What did this people do to you, that you have brought a great sin on them?”
\p
\v 22 And Aaron said, “Do not let {your} nose burn, my lord. You know the people, that it {is/was} in evil.
\v 23 And they said to me, ‘Make for us a god that will go before our faces. As for this Moses, the man that brought us up from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has happened to him.’
\v 24 And I said to them, ‘Whoever has gold, take it off yourself.’ And they gave {it} to me, and I threw it in the fire, and this calf came out.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 25 And Moses saw the people, that it was let loose, for Aaron had let it loose, to mockery by the risers-up against them.
\v 26 And Moses stood in the gate of the camp and said, “Who {is} for Yahweh, to me!” And all of the sons of Levi gathered themselves to him.
\v 27 And he said to them, “Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: ‘Each man put his sword on his side. Pass through and return from gate to gate in the camp and kill each his brother and each his companion and each his neighbor.’”

\ts\*
\v 28 And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses. And on that day about 3, 000 men from the people fell.
\v 29 And Moses said, “Fill your hand for Yahweh today! For a man {was} against his son and against his brother and for putting a blessing on yourselves today.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 30 And it happened the next day that Moses said to the people, “You have sinned a great sin. And now I will go up to Yahweh. Perhaps I can atone for your sin.”
\v 31 And Moses returned to Yahweh and said, “Oh, this people has sinned a great sin and made themselves gods of gold.
\v 32 But now, if you forgive their sin; but if not, please blot me out of your book that you have written.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 33 But Yahweh said to Moses, “Whoever that sinned against me, I will blot him out from my book.
\v 34 So now go, lead the people to where I have spoken to you! Behold, my angel will go before your face. But on the day I visit them, then I will visit their sin on them.”

\v 35 And Yahweh plagued the people because they had made the calf (that Aaron made).

\v 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, “Go, arise from here, you and the people whom you have brought up from the land of Egypt to the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, ‘I will give it to your seed.’
\v 2 And I will send an angel before your face, and I will drive out the Canaanites, the Amorites and the Hittites and the Perizzites, Hivites and the Jebusites.

\v 8 And he made the breastpiece, the work of a skillful craftsman, like the work of the ephod, from gold, blue, and purple and worm of scarlet and twisted fine linen.
\v 9 It was square, folded double. They made the breastpiece, its length: a span; and its width: a span folded double.

\ts\*
\v 10 And they set in it four rows of precious stones. The first row {was} a row of a ruby, of a topaz, and of a garnet.
\v 11 And the second row: an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.
\v 12 And the third row: a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst.
\v 13 And the fourth row: a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper. {The stones were} surrounded by ornamental gold settings.

\ts\*
\v 14 And the precious stones {were} according to the names of the sons of Israel—they {were} according to their 12 names. Each {was like} the engraving of a signet according to its name—for the 12 tribes.
\ts\*
\p
\v 15 And they made twisted chains on the breastpiece, as a work of rope—pure gold.
\v 16 And they made two ornamental settings of gold and two rings of gold and put the two rings on the two ends of the breastpiece.

\ts\*
\v 17 And they attached the two chains of gold to the rings on the two ends of the breastpiece.
\v 18 And they attached two of the ends of the two chains to the two ornamental settings. And they attached those to the shoulder pieces of the ephod at the front of its face.
\ts\*
\v 19 And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends of the breastpiece, on the edge which is toward the inner side of the ephod.
\v 20 And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two shoulder pieces of the ephod on the bottom of the front of its face, close to its joining above the skillfully crafted waistband of the ephod.
\ts\*
\v 21 And they tied the breastpiece by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a cord of blue to be on the finely crafted waistband of the ephod, so the breastpiece could not become detached from {being} with the ephod just as Yahweh had commanded Moses.

\ts\*
\p
\v 22 And he made the robe of the ephod entirely of blue, the work of a weaver.
\v 23 The opening of the robe {was} in the middle of it like an opening of a garment. The edge for its opening was all around so that it could not tear.
\ts\*
\v 24 On the bottom hem of the robe they made pomegranates of twisted blue, purple, and scarlet yarn.
\v 25 And they made bells of pure gold, and they put the bells between the pomegranates all around on the bottom edge of the robe, between the pomegranates—
\v 26 a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate—all around on the hem of the robe for serving, just as Yahweh had commanded Moses.

\ts\*
\p
\v 27 And they made the tunics of fine linen for Aaron and for his sons, the work of a weaver,
\v 28 and the fine linen turban and the fine linen ornate headbands and the linen undergarments of fine twisted linen
\v 29 and the sash of fine linen and of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, the work of an embroiderer, just as Yahweh had commanded Moses.

\ts\*
\p
\v 30 And they made the rosette of the crown of holiness of pure gold and inscribed an inscription on it, like the engraving on a signet, “Holy to Yahweh.”
\v 31 And they put a cord of blue on it to attach it on the top of the turban, just as Yahweh had commanded Moses.

\ts\*
\p
\v 32 And all the service of the Dwelling, the tent of meeting, was finished. And the sons of Israel did according to all that Yahweh had commanded Moses; thus they did.
\v 33 And they brought the Dwelling to Moses: the tent and all its equipment and its clasps and its frames and its bars and its pillars and its bases;
\v 34 and the covering of reddened hides of rams and the covering of hides of sea-cows and the curtain of covering;
\v 35 the Box of the Testimony and the poles and the atonement lid;

\ts\*
\v 36 the table with all of its equipment and the bread of the faces;
\v 37 the pure lampstand with its lamps, lamps of the row, and all its accessories and the oil of the light;
\v 38 and the altar of gold and the oil of anointing and the incense of fragrance and the curtain of the entrance of the tent;
\v 39 the altar of bronze and the grate of bronze that {is} for it, its poles and all of its utensils, the basin and its base;
\ts\*
\v 40 the curtains of the courtyard, its pillars and bases and the curtain of the gate of the courtyard, its ropes and its tent pegs and all the items of the service of the Dwelling for the tent of meeting;
\v 41 finely-woven clothing for serving in the Holy Place, the clothing of holiness for Aaron the priest, and the clothing of his sons, to {be} priests.
\ts\*
\v 42 Thus the sons of Israel did all the work according to all that Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\v 43 And Moses saw all of the work, and behold, they had done it. Just as Yahweh had commanded, thus they had done. And Moses blessed them.

\p
\v 1 And Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,
\v 2 “On the first day of the month, in the first month, you shall raise up the Dwelling of the tent of meeting.

\ts\*
\v 3 And you shall place the Box of the Testimony there, and you shall cover over the box with the curtain.
\v 4 And you shall bring in the table and arrange its arrangement. And you shall bring in the lampstand and set up its lamps.

\ts\*
\v 5 And you shall put the altar of gold for incense before the face of the Box of the Testimony, and you shall place the curtain of the gate to the Dwelling.
\v 6 And you shall put the altar of the burnt offering before the face of the gate of the Dwelling, the tent of meeting.
\ts\*
\v 7 And you shall put the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar and put water there.
\v 8 And you shall set up the courtyard around it, and set up the curtain of the gate of the courtyard.
\ts\*
\p
\v 9 And you shall take the oil of anointing and anoint the Dwelling and everything that is in it. And you shall set apart it and all its furnishings, and it will be holy.
\v 10 And you shall anoint the altar of the burnt offering and all its utensils. And you shall set apart the altar, and the altar will be a holiest holy thing.
\v 11 And you shall anoint the basin and its base and set it apart.
\ts\*
\p
\v 12 And you shall bring Aaron and his sons to the gate of the tent of meeting and wash them with water.
\v 13 And you shall clothe Aaron with the garments of holiness and anoint him and set him apart, and he will serve as a priest to me.

\ts\*
\v 14 And you shall bring his sons and clothe them {with} tunics.
\v 15 And you shall anoint them just as you anointed their father, and they will serve as priests to me. And their anointing will cause them to be a priesthood forever throughout their generations.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 16 And Moses did according to all that Yahweh had commanded him. Thus he did.
\p
\v 17 And it was in the first month, the second year, on the first of the month {that} the Dwelling was raised up.
\ts\*
\v 18 And Moses raised up the Dwelling and placed its bases and set up its frames and placed its bars and set up its pillars.
\v 19 And he spread the tent over the Dwelling and put the covering of the tent over it on the top, just as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\ts\*
\v 20 And he took the testimony and put {it} into the box. And he put the poles on the box and put the atonement lid on the top of the box.
\v 21 And he brought the box into the Dwelling. And he set up the curtain of covering, and he covered over the Box of the Testimony, just as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\ts\*
\v 22 And he put the table into the tent of meeting, on the north side of the Dwelling, outside of the curtain.
\v 23 And he arranged on it the arrangement of bread before the face of Yahweh, just as Yahweh had commanded Moses.

\ts\*
\v 24 And he put the lampstand into the tent of meeting, across from the table, on the south side of the Dwelling.
\v 25 And he lifted up the lamps before the face of Yahweh, just as Yahweh had commanded Moses.

\ts\*
\v 26 And he put the altar of gold into the tent of meeting in front of the face of the curtain.
\v 27 And he caused smoke on it, incense of fragrance, just as Yahweh had commanded Moses.

\ts\*
\v 28 And he set up the curtain of the gate of the Dwelling.
\v 29 And he put the altar of the burnt offering at the gate of the Dwelling, the tent of meeting, and offered up on it the burnt offering and the grain offering, just as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\v 30 And he placed the basin between the tent of meeting and the altar, and he put water for washing there.
\v 31 And Moses, and Aaron, and his sons would wash their hands and their feet from it.
\v 32 Whenever they went into the tent of meeting and whenever they went close to the altar, they washed themselves, just as Yahweh had commanded Moses.
\ts\*
\v 33 And he raised up the courtyard around the Dwelling and the altar. And he set up the curtain of the gate of the courtyard. And Moses finished the work.

\ts\*
\p
\v 34 And the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory of Yahweh filled the Dwelling.
\v 35 And Moses was not able to go into the tent of meeting, because the cloud had settled on it and the glory of Yahweh had filled the Dwelling.
\ts\*
\v 36 And whenever the cloud was taken up from over the Dwelling, the sons of Israel would set out on all their travels,
\v 37 but if the cloud was not taken up, then they would not set out until the day it was taken up.
\v 38 For the cloud of Yahweh {was} over the Dwelling by day, and fire was on it by night, before the eyes of all the house of Israel in all their travels.
