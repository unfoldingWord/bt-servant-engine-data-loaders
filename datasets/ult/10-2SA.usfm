\c 1
\p
\v 1 And it happened after the death of Saul that David returned from striking Amalek. And David remained in Ziklag two days.
\v 2 And it happened on the third day that, behold, a man came from the camp, from with Saul, and his clothes were torn, and dirt {was} on his head. And it happened, when he came to David, that he fell to the ground and prostrated himself.

\ts\*
\p
\v 3 And David said to him, “Where from this are you coming?”

\ts\*
\p
And he said to him, “I have escaped from the camp of Israel.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 4 And David said to him, “How was the matter? Declare to me, please.”

\ts\*
\p
And he said that the people had fled from the battle, and also many from the people had fallen and died, and also Saul and Jonathan his son had died.

\ts\*
\v 5 And David said to the young man, the one declaring to him, “How do you know that Saul and Jonathan his son died?”

\ts\*
\p
\v 6 And the young man, the one declaring to him, said, “Happening to be, I happened to be on the mountain of Gilboa, and behold, Saul was leaning on his spear. And behold, the chariots and the masters of the horsemen had overtaken him.
\v 7 And he turned behind him, and he saw me. And he called to me, and I said, ‘Behold me.’

\ts\*
\p
\v 8 And he said to me, ‘Who {are} you?’

\ts\*
\p
And I said to him, ‘I {am} an Amalekite.’

\ts\*
\p
\v 9 And he said to me, ‘Please stand over me and kill me, for agony has seized me, for my life {is} still whole in me.’

\ts\*
\p
\v 10 So I stood over him and killed him, for I knew that he would not live after his having fallen. And I took the crown that {was} on his head and the band that {was} on his arm, and I have brought them here to my lord.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 11 And David seized his clothes and tore them, and also all of the men who {were} with him.
\v 12 And they mourned and wept and fasted until the evening for Saul and for Jonathan his son and for the people of Yahweh and for the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword.

\ts\*
\p
\v 13 And David said to the young man declaring to him, “Where from this {are} you?”

\ts\*
\p
And he said, “I {am} the son of a man, a foreigner, an Amalekite.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 14 And David said to him, “How did you not fear to stretch out your hand to destroy the anointed of Yahweh?”

\ts\*
\p
\v 15 And David called to one of the young men, and he said, “Approach, attack him!” And he struck him, and he died.
\v 16 And David said to him, “Your blood {is} on your head, for your mouth answered against you, saying, ‘I myself killed the anointed of Yahweh.’”

\ts\*
\p
\v 17 Then David lamented this lamentation for Saul and for Jonathan his son.
\v 18 And he said to teach the sons of Judah “The Bow.” Behold, it is written in the Book of Jashar:

\ts\*
\p
\v 19 “The splendor of Israel {is} slain on your high places!

\ts\*
\p
How the mighty have fallen!
\v 20 May they not declare {it} in Gath, may they not proclaim {it} in the streets of Ashkelon, lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph.

\ts\*
\p
\v 21 Mountains in Gilboa, {may} not dew and {may} not rain {be} upon you, nor fields of offerings, for there the shield of the mighty was loathed, the shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.

\ts\*
\p
\v 22 From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty, the bow of Jonathan did not turn itself back, and the sword of Saul did not return empty.
\v 23 Saul and Jonathan {were} being loved and delightful in their lives, and in their death they were not separated.

\ts\*
\p
They were swifter than eagles, they were mightier than lions.
\v 24 Daughters of Israel, weep for Saul, the one having clothed you {in} scarlet with delights, the one having put an ornament of gold on your clothing.

\ts\*
\p
\v 25 How the mighty have fallen in the midst of battle! Jonathan {is} slain on your high places.
\v 26 It is narrow to me concerning you, my brother Jonathan! You were very pleasant to me.

\ts\*
\p
Your love was more wonderful to me than the love of women.
\v 27 How the mighty have fallen and the weapons of war have perished!”

\ts\*

\c 2
\p
\v 1 And it happened after this that David inquired of Yahweh, saying, “Shall I go up into one of the cities of Judah?”

\ts\*
\p
And Yahweh said to him, “Go up.”

\ts\*
\p
And David said, “Where shall I go up?”

\ts\*
\p
And he said, “To Hebron.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 2 So David went up there, and also the two of his wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess and Abigail, the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.
\v 3 And his men who {were} with him, David brought up, a man and his house. And they dwelled in the cities of Hebron.

\ts\*
\v 4 And the men of Judah came, and they anointed David there as king over the house of Judah.

\ts\*
\p
And they declared to David, saying, “{It was} the men of Jabesh Gilead who buried Saul.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 5 And David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh Gilead, and he said to them, “Blessed {are} you by Yahweh, that you have done this kindness with your master, with Saul, and have buried him.

\ts\*
\v 6 And now, may Yahweh do kindness and faithfulness with you. And I myself will also do this good with you because you have done this thing.
\v 7 And now, may your hands be strong, and be sons of valor, for your master Saul has died, and also the house of Judah has anointed me as king over them.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 8 But Abner, the son of Ner, the commander of the army that {was} to Saul, took Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, and brought him over {to} Mahanaim.
\v 9 And he made him rule over Gilead and over the Ashurite and over Jezreel and over Ephraim and over Benjamin and over Israel, all of it.

\ts\*
\p
\v 10 Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, {was} a son of 40 years when he became king over Israel, and he reigned two years. Nevertheless, the house of Judah were behind David.
\v 11 And the number of the days that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.

\ts\*
\p
\v 12 Now Abner, the son of Ner, and the servants of Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
\v 13 And Joab, the son of Zeruiah, and the servants of David went out and encountered them together by the pool of Gibeon. And they sat down, these by the pool on this {side} and these by the pool on that {side}.

\ts\*
\p
\v 14 Then Abner said to Joab, “May the young men now arise and play to our faces.”

\ts\*
\p
And Joab said, “May they arise.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 15 So they arose and crossed over, 12 by number to Benjamin and to Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, and 12 from the servants of David.

\ts\*
\v 16 And they seized, a man his fellow by the head, and his sword in the side of his fellow, and they fell together. So one called that place Helkath Hazzurim, which {is} in Gibeon.

\ts\*
\p
\v 17 And the battle was severe to extremity on that day. And Abner and the men of Israel were struck to the face of the servants of David.

\ts\*
\p
\v 18 Now the three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab and Abishai and Asahel. And Asahel {was} light on his feet, like one of the gazelles that {are} in the field.
\v 19 And Asahel pursued after Abner, and he did not turn aside to go to the right or to the left from after Abner.
\v 20 And Abner turned behind him, and he said, “{Is} this you, Asahel?”

\ts\*
\p
And he said, “{It is} I.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 21 And Abner said to him, “Turn aside for yourself to your right or to your left and seize for yourself one of the young men and take for yourself his spoil.” But Asahel was not willing to turn from behind him.

\ts\*
\p
\v 22 And Abner continued still, saying to Asahel, “Turn aside for yourself from behind me. Why should I strike you to the ground? Then how would I lift my face to Joab your brother?”

\ts\*
\p
\v 23 But he refused to turn aside, so Abner struck him with the back end of the spear in the stomach, and the spear came out from his back. And he fell there, and he died under him. And it happened, every one coming to the place where Asahel fell there and died, that they stood.

\ts\*
\p
\v 24 But Joab and Abishai pursued after Abner, and the sun was coming in, and they themselves came to the hill of Ammah, which {is} on the face of Giah, the way of the wilderness of Gibeon.
\v 25 Now the sons of Benjamin had gathered themselves behind Abner, and they had become one troop. And they stood on the head of one hill.

\ts\*
\p
\v 26 And Abner called to Joab and said, “Shall the sword devour forever? Do you not know that it will be bitter at the last? So until when will you not say to the people to turn from after their brothers?”

\ts\*
\p
\v 27 And Joab said, “The life of God, that if you had not spoken, that then from the morning the people would have taken itself up, a man from after his brother.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 28 Then Joab blew on the shofar, and all of the people stood, and they did not still pursue after Israel, and they did not still continue to fight.

\ts\*
\p
\v 29 And Abner and his men walked through the Arabah all of that night, and they crossed the Jordan, and they walked all of the morning, and they came {to} Mahanaim.

\ts\*
\p
\v 30 And Joab returned from after Abner, and he assembled all of the people. And 19 men and Asahel were missing from the servants of David.
\v 31 But the servants of David had struck from Benjamin and among the men of Abner 360 men, they had died.
\v 32 And they took up Asahel, and they buried him in the tomb of his father, which {was in} Bethlehem. And Joab and his men walked all of the night, and it became light for them at Hebron.

\ts\*

\c 3
\p
\v 1 And the war was long between the house of Saul and between the house of David. And David was going and strong, but the house of Saul were going and weak.

\ts\*
\p
\v 2 Now sons were born to David in Hebron.

\ts\*
\p
And his firstborn was Amnon, to Ahinoam the Jezreelitess.

\ts\*
\p
\v 3 And his second {was} Chileab, to Abigail, the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.

\ts\*
\p
And the third {was} Absalom, the son of Maacah, the daughter of Talmai, the king of Geshur.

\ts\*
\p
\v 4 And the fourth {was} Adonijah, the son of Haggith.

\ts\*
\p
And the fifth {was} Shephatiah, the son of Abital.

\ts\*
\p
\v 5 And the sixth {was} Ithream, to Eglah, the wife of David.

\ts\*
\p
These were born to David in Hebron.

\ts\*
\p
\v 6 And it happened, when the war was between the house of Saul and between the house of David, that Abner was strengthening himself in the house of Saul.
\v 7 And a concubine {was} to Saul, and her name {was} Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah. And he said to Abner, “Why have you gone in to the concubine of my father?”

\ts\*
\p
\v 8 And it burned greatly to Abner concerning the words of Ishbosheth. And he said, “{Am} I the head of a dog that {is} to Judah? Today I am doing kindness with the house of Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends, and I have not delivered you into the hand of David. Yet today you charge against me the iniquity of a woman!

\ts\*
\v 9 Thus may God do to Abner, and thus may he add to him, if, according to what Yahweh has sworn to David, that thus I will do for him,
\v 10 to cause the kingdom to pass over from the house of Saul and to raise up the throne of David over Israel and over Judah, from Dan and to Beersheba.”
\v 11 And he was not able to return a further word {to} Abner, because of his fearing him.

\ts\*
\p
\v 12 And Abner sent messengers to David in place of him, saying, “To whom {is} the land?” saying, “Cut your covenant with me, and behold, my hand {will be} with you to make all of Israel turn to you.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 13 And he said, “Good, I, I will cut a covenant with you. Only one thing I am asking from you, saying, ‘You shall not see my face unless you bring Michal, the daughter of Saul, to my face when you come to see my face.’”
\v 14 And David sent messengers to Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, saying, “Give {me} my wife Michal, whom I betrothed to myself with 100 foreskins of Philistines.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 15 And Ishbosheth sent and took her from with {her} husband, from with Paltiel, the son of Laish.
\v 16 And her husband went with her, going and weeping after her, to Bahurim. Then Abner said to him, “Go, return.” So he returned.

\ts\*
\p
\v 17 Now the word of Abner had been with the elders of Israel, saying, “Both yesterday and the third day you were seeking David as king over you.
\v 18 And now, do {it}, for Yahweh spoke about David, saying, ‘By the hand of David my servant, I will save my people Israel from the hand of the Philistines and from the hand of all of their enemies.’”

\ts\*
\p
\v 19 And Abner had also spoken in the ears of Benjamin. Then Abner went also to speak in the ears of David in Hebron all that {had been} good in the eyes of Israel and in the eyes of all of the house of Benjamin.
\v 20 And Abner came to David {in} Hebron, and with him {were} 20 men. And David made a feast for Abner and for the men who {were} with him.

\ts\*
\v 21 Then Abner said to David, “Let me arise and go and gather to my lord the king all of Israel so they may cut a covenant with you so you may reign over all that your soul desires.” And David sent Abner away, and he went in peace.

\ts\*
\p
\v 22 And behold, the servants of David and Joab came from a raid, and they brought much plunder with them. But Abner, he {was} not with David in Hebron, for he had sent him away and he had gone in peace.
\v 23 And Joab and all of the army that {was} with him came, and they declared to Joab, saying, “Abner, the son of Ner, came to the king, and he sent him away, and he went in peace.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 24 And Joab came to the king, and he said, “What have you done? Behold, Abner came to you! Why {is} this, you have sent him away, and going, he has gone?
\v 25 You know Abner, the son of Ner, that he came to deceive you and to know your going out and your coming in and to know all that you are doing!”

\ts\*
\p
\v 26 And Joab went out from with David, and he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the cistern of Sirah. But David did not know.
\v 27 And Abner returned {to} Hebron, and Joab turned him aside to the middle of the gate to speak with him in quiet. And he struck him there {in} the stomach, and he died, for the blood of Asahel his brother.

\ts\*
\p
\v 28 And David heard after this, and he said, “I and my kingdom {are} innocent from with Yahweh forever from the blood of Abner, the son of Ner.
\v 29 May it writhe on the head of Joab and to all of the house of his father, and may not be cut off from the house of Joab one discharging or one stricken with leprosy or one holding onto a staff or one falling by the sword or a destitute of bread.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 30 Now Joab and Abishai his brother had murdered Abner because he had killed Asahel their brother at Gibeon in the battle.

\ts\*
\p
\v 31 And David said to Joab and to all of the people who {were} with him, “Tear your clothes and put on sackcloth and mourn to the face of Abner.” And King David was walking behind the bier.
\v 32 And they buried Abner in Hebron. And the king lifted up his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all of the people wept.

\ts\*
\p
\v 33 And the king lamented for Abner, and he said, “Should Abner have died like the death of a fool?
\v 34 Your hands were not bound, and your feet were not put in shackles. As falling to the face of sons of wickedness, you have fallen.”

\ts\*
\p
And all of the people added to weep for him.
\v 35 Then all of the people came to make David eat bread while {it was} still day, but David swore, saying, “Thus may God do to me, and thus may he add, that if to the face of the coming in of the sun I taste bread or any of a thing.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 36 And all of the people noticed, and it was good in their eyes, as everything that the king did was good in the eyes of all of the people.
\v 37 So all of the people and all of Israel knew on that day that it had not been from the king to kill Abner, the son of Ner.

\ts\*
\p
\v 38 And the king said to his servants, “Do you not know that a commander and great has fallen this day in Israel?
\v 39 And I {am} weak today, though anointed king. For these men, the sons of Zeruiah, {are} more harsh than I. May Yahweh repay the one doing evil according to his evil.”

\ts\*

\c 4
\p
\v 1 And the son of Saul heard that Abner had died in Hebron, and his hands dropped, and all of Israel was terrified.
\v 2 Now two men, commanders of troops, were {to} the son of Saul. The name of the one {was} Baanah, and the name of the second {was} Rechab, sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, from the sons of Benjamin, for Beeroth is also reckoned to Benjamin.
\v 3 (But the Beerothites had fled to Gittaim, and they have been sojourning there to this day.)

\ts\*
\p
\v 4 Now to Jonathan, the son of Saul, {was} a son, lame of feet. He was a son of five years when the report of Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel. And his nurse picked him up and fled. And it happened, when she hurried to flee, that he fell and became lame. And his name {was} Mephibosheth.

\ts\*
\p
\v 5 And the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, went, and they came about the heat of the day to the house of Ishbosheth, and he was lying {on} the bed of noon.
\v 6 And behold, they came to the midst of the house, takers of wheat, and they struck him in the stomach. And Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped.

\ts\*
\p
\v 7 For they entered the house, and he was lying on his bed in the chamber of his bed, and they struck him, and they killed him, and they removed his head. And they took his head, and they walked the way of the Arabah all of the night.

\ts\*
\v 8 And they brought the head of Ishbosheth to David {at} Hebron, and they said to the king, “Behold, the head of Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, your enemy who sought your life. Now Yahweh has given to my lord the king vengeance this day against Saul and against his seed.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 9 But David answered Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and he said to them, “The life of Yahweh, who rescued my life from every distress,
\v 10 that the one declaring to me, saying, ‘Behold, Saul is dead,’ and in his eyes he was like a bringer of {good} news, that I seized him, and I killed him at Ziklag, which {was} me giving him a reward for good news.

\ts\*
\v 11 How much more, when men of wickedness have murdered a man of righteousness in his house on his bed! And now, shall I not seek his blood from your hand and consume you from the earth?”

\ts\*
\p
\v 12 And David commanded the young men, and they killed them, and they cut off their hands and their feet, and they hung {them} beside the pool in Hebron. But the head of Ishbosheth, they took and buried in the grave of Abner in Hebron.

\ts\*
\p

\c 5
\p
\v 1 And all of the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron. And they spoke, saying, “Behold us, we {are} your bone and your flesh.
\v 2 Both yesterday and the third day, when Saul was king over us, you, you were the one bringing out and bringing in Israel. And Yahweh said to you, ‘You, you will shepherd my people Israel, and you, you will become the ruler over Israel.’”

\ts\*
\p
\v 3 Then all of the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and King David cut for them a covenant in Hebron to the face of Yahweh. And they anointed David as king over Israel.

\ts\*
\p
\v 4 David {was} a son of 30 years when he became king. He reigned 40 years.
\v 5 In Hebron, he reigned over Judah seven years and six months. And in Jerusalem, he reigned 33 years over all of Israel and Judah.

\ts\*
\p
\v 6 And the king and his men went {to} Jerusalem, to the Jebusite, the dweller of the land. And he spoke to David, saying, “You will not come here, but surely the blind and the lame will turn you away,” saying, “David will not come here.”
\v 7 But David captured the stronghold of Zion. (It {is} the City of David.)

\ts\*
\p
\v 8 And David said on that day, “Anyone striking the Jebusite, then let him approach through the water shaft the lame and the blind, hated by the soul of David.” (Therefore they say, “The blind and the lame shall not come into the house.”)

\ts\*
\p
\v 9 And David dwelled in the stronghold, and he called it the City of David. And David built around {it}, from the Millo and toward the house.
\v 10 And David went, going and becoming great, for Yahweh, the God of Armies, {was} with him.

\ts\*
\p
\v 11 And Hiram, the king of Tyre, sent messengers to David, and trees of cedar and craftsmen of wood and craftsmen of stone of wall. And they built a house for David.
\v 12 Then David knew that Yahweh had established him as king over Israel and that he had lifted up his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel.

\ts\*
\p
\v 13 And David again took concubines and wives at Jerusalem after his coming from Hebron. And again sons and daughters were born to David.
\v 14 And these {are} the names of the ones born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua and Shobab and Nathan and Solomon
\v 15 and Ibhar and Elishua and Nepheg and Japhia
\v 16 and Elishama and Eliada and Eliphelet.

\ts\*
\p
\v 17 And the Philistines heard that they had anointed David as king over Israel, and all of the Philistines went up to seek David. And David heard, and he went down to the stronghold.
\v 18 And the Philistines came, and they spread themselves out in the Valley of the Raphaites.

\ts\*
\v 19 And David inquired of Yahweh, saying, “Shall I go up to the Philistines? Will you give them into my hand?”

\ts\*
\p
And Yahweh said to David, “Go up, for giving, I will give the Philistines into your hand.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 20 So David came {to} Baal Perazim, and David struck them there. And he said, “Yahweh has broken through my enemies to my face like the breach of waters.” Therefore he called the name of that place Baal Perazim.
\v 21 And they abandoned their idols there, and David and his men took them away.

\ts\*
\p
\v 22 And the Philistines resumed again to go up, and they spread themselves out in the Valley of the Raphaites.
\v 23 And David inquired of Yahweh, and he said, “You shall not go up. Go around to behind them, and you shall come to them from opposite the balsam trees.

\ts\*
\v 24 And it will be, when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then you shall act determinedly, for then Yahweh will go out to your face to strike the camp of the Philistines.”
\v 25 And David did thus, just as Yahweh commanded him. And he struck the Philistines from Geba to your coming {to} Gezer.

\ts\*

\c 6
\p
\v 1 And David again gathered all of the chosen in Israel, 30, 000.
\v 2 And David arose and went, and all of the people who {were} with him, from Baalah of Judah to bring up from there the Box of God, whose name is called {by} the name of Yahweh of Armies, dweller of the cherubim upon it.

\ts\*
\v 3 And they mounted the Box of God on a new cart, and they bore it from the house of Abinadab, which {was} on the hill. And Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, were guiding the new cart.
\v 4 And they bore it from the house of Abinadab, which {was} on the hill, with the Box of God, and Ahio was walking to the face of the Box.
\v 5 And David and all of the house of Israel were celebrating to the face of Yahweh with all woods of cypress and with lyres and with harps and with tambourines and with sistrums and with cymbals.

\ts\*
\p
\v 6 And they came to the threshing floor of Nacon, and Uzzah reached out to the Box of God and held it, for the oxen stumbled.
\v 7 And the nose of Yahweh burned against Uzzah, and God struck him there for the fault. And he died there by the Box of God.

\ts\*
\p
\v 8 And it burned to David because Yahweh had broken out an outbreak against Uzzah. And he called that place Perez Uzzah, to this day.

\ts\*
\p
\v 9 And David feared Yahweh on that day, and he said, “How shall the Box of Yahweh come to me?”

\ts\*
\v 10 And David was not willing to bring to himself the Box of Yahweh to the City of David. So David turned it aside {to} the house of Obed Edom the Gittite.
\v 11 And the Box of Yahweh remained {in} the house of Obed Edom the Gittite three months. And Yahweh blessed Obed Edom and all of his house.

\ts\*
\p
\v 12 And it was declared to King David, saying, “Yahweh has blessed the house of Obed Edom and all who {are} to him for the sake of the Box of God.” So David went, and he brought up the Box of God from the house of Obed Edom {to} the City of David with joy.
\v 13 And it happened, when the carriers of the Box of Yahweh had stepped six steps, that he sacrificed an ox and a fatling.

\ts\*
\v 14 And David danced to the face of Yahweh with all of {his} strength. And David was girded {with} an ephod of linen.
\v 15 And David and all of the house of Israel were bringing up the Box of Yahweh with shouting and with the sound of the shofar,

\ts\*
\p
\v 16 and the Box of Yahweh was entering the City of David. But Michal, the daughter of Saul, looked down through a window, and she saw King David leaping and dancing to the face of Yahweh, and she despised him in her heart.

\ts\*
\p
\v 17 And they brought the Box of Yahweh, and they set it in its place in the midst of the tent that David had pitched for it. And David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings to the face of Yahweh.

\ts\*
\v 18 And David finished offering the burnt offering and the peace offerings, and he blessed the people in the name of Yahweh of Armies.
\v 19 And he distributed to all of the people, to all of the multitude of Israel, to man and to woman, to a man one cake of bread and one date cake and one raisin cake. And all of the people went, a man to his house.

\ts\*
\p
\v 20 Then David returned to bless his house. And Michal, the daughter of Saul, came out to meet David, and she said, “How the king of Israel honored himself today, who uncovered himself today to the eyes of the female servants of his servants, as uncovering himself, one of the worthless uncovers himself!”

\ts\*
\p
\v 21 But David said to Michal, “To the face of Yahweh, who chose me instead of your father and instead of all of his house to appoint me leader over the people of Yahweh, over Israel, yes, I celebrated to the face of Yahweh!
\v 22 And I will humble myself more than this, and I will be lowly in my eyes. But with the female servants {about} whom you spoke, with them, I will be honored.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 23 And to Michal, the daughter of Saul, {there} was not a child to her to the day of her death.

\c 7
\p
\v 1 And it happened, when the king dwelled in his house and Yahweh gave rest to him from all around, from all of his enemies,
\v 2 that the king said to Nathan the prophet, “See, please, I am dwelling in a house of cedars, but the Box of God is dwelling in the midst of a curtain.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 3 And Nathan said to the king, “All that {is} in your heart, go, do, for Yahweh {is} with you.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 4 But it happened, during that night, that the word of Yahweh was to Nathan, saying,

\ts\*
\p
\v 5 “Go, and you shall say to my servant, to David, ‘Thus says Yahweh, “You, will you build for me a house for my dwelling?

\ts\*
\v 6 For I have not lived in a house from the day of my bringing up the sons of Israel from Egypt and to this day, but I have been going about in a tent and in a dwelling.
\v 7 In any {place} where I went about with all of the sons of Israel, did I speak a word with one of the scepters of Israel whom I commanded to shepherd my people Israel, saying, ‘Why have you not built for me a house of cedars’?”’

\ts\*
\p
\v 8 And now, thus shall you say to my servant, to David, ‘Thus says Yahweh of Armies, “I, I took you from the pasture, from after the flock, to become a ruler over my people, over Israel.
\v 9 And I have been with you in every {place} where you have gone, and I have cut off all of your enemies from your face. And I will make for you a great name, like the name of the great who {have been} on the earth.

\ts\*
\v 10 And I have established a place for my people, for Israel, and I will plant him that he may dwell under him, and he will not tremble anymore, and the sons of wickedness will not continue to afflict him as at first,
\v 11 and from the day when I commanded judges over my people Israel.

\ts\*
\p
And I will give rest to you from all of your enemies. And Yahweh declares to you that Yahweh will make a house for you.
\v 12 When your days are full and you lie down with your fathers, then I will raise up after you your seed who will come forth from your belly, and I will establish his kingdom.
\v 13 He, he will build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom to forever!
\v 14 I myself will be a father to him, and he himself will be a son to me, that when he sins, then I will correct him with the rod of men and with the blows of the sons of man.

\ts\*
\v 15 But my covenant faithfulness will not turn away from you as I turned it away from with Saul, whom I turned away from your face.
\v 16 And your house and your kingdom will be confirmed to forever to your face. Your throne will be established to forever.”’”

\ts\*
\p
\v 17 According to all of these words and according to all of this vision, thus Nathan spoke to David.

\ts\*
\p
\v 18 And King David went,

\ts\*
\p
and he sat to the face of Yahweh, and he said, “Who {am} I, my Lord Yahweh, and what {is} my house, that you have brought me to here?
\v 19 And this was yet small in your eyes, my Lord Yahweh, for you have spoken even about the house of your servant to afar. And this {is} the law of man, my Lord Yahweh!

\ts\*
\p
\v 20 And what more shall David continue to say to you? But you, you know your servant, my Lord Yahweh.

\ts\*
\v 21 For the sake of your word and according to your heart, you have done all this greatness, to make your servant know {this}.

\ts\*
\p
\v 22 Therefore, you are great, my Lord Yahweh, for {there is} none like you and {there is} no God except you, in all that we have heard with our ears.
\v 23 And who {is} like your people, like Israel, the one nation on earth whose God went to redeem for himself as a people and to make for himself a name and to do greatness for you and {things} being feared for your land, from the face of your people whom you redeemed for yourself from Egypt, nations and its gods?

\ts\*
\v 24 And you established for yourself your people Israel as a people for yourself to forever. And you yourself, Yahweh, became God to them.

\ts\*
\p
\v 25 And now, Yahweh God, the word that you have spoken concerning your servant and concerning his house, raise up to forever, and do just as you have spoken.
\v 26 And may your name be great to forever, saying, ‘Yahweh of Armies {is} God over Israel,’ and the house of your servant David will be established to your face.

\ts\*
\p
\v 27 For you, Yahweh of Armies, {are} the God of Israel. You have uncovered the ear of your servant, saying, ‘I will build a house for you.’ Therefore, your servant has found his heart to pray this prayer to you.
\v 28 And now, my Lord Yahweh, you {are} he, the God, so your words are true. And you have spoken concerning this good your servant.
\v 29 And now, take pleasure and bless the house of your servant to be to your face forever. For you, my Lord Yahweh, you have spoken and from your blessing the house of your servant will be blessed forever.”

\v 1 And it happened after this, that David struck the Philistines, and he subdued them. And David took Metheg Ammah from the hand of the Philistines.

\ts\*
\p
\v 2 And he struck Moab, and he measured them with a rope, making them lie on the ground. And he measured two ropes to kill and the fullness of the rope to let live. And Moab became servants to David, lifters of tribute.

\ts\*
\p
\v 3 And David struck Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, the king of Zobah, when he went to restore his hand at the River.
\v 4 And David took from him 1, 700 horsemen and 20, 000 men on foot. And David hamstrung all of the chariots, but he left from them 100 chariots.

\ts\*
\p
\v 5 And Aram of Damascus came to help Hadadezer, the king of Zobah. And David struck 22, 000 men among Aram.
\v 6 And David put garrisons in Aram of Damascus, and Aram became servants to David, lifters of tribute. And Yahweh saved David in all that he went.

\ts\*
\p
\v 7 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants of Hadadezer, and he brought them {to} Jerusalem.
\v 8 And from Betah and from Berothai, the cities of Hadadezer, King David took bronze, making very much.

\ts\*
\p
\v 9 And Toi, the king of Hamath, heard that David had struck all of the army of Hadadezer.
\v 10 And Toi sent Joram his son to King David to ask about him regarding peace and to bless him because he had fought with Hadadezer and had struck him. For Hadadezer had been a man of war of Toi. And in his hand were vessels of silver and vessels of gold and vessels of bronze.

\ts\*
\p
\v 11 King David also consecrated them to Yahweh, with the silver and the gold that he consecrated from all of the nations that he had subdued,
\v 12 from Aram and from Moab and from the sons of Ammon and from the Philistines and from Amalek and from the plunder of Hadadezer, the son of Rehob, the king of Zobah.

\ts\*
\p
\v 13 And David made a name when he returned from his striking Aram in the Valley of Salt, 18, 000.

\ts\*
\p
\v 14 And he put garrisons in Edom. In all of Edom, garrisons there. And it happened, all of Edom {became} servants to David. And Yahweh saved David in all that he went.

\ts\*
\p
\v 15 And David was king over all of Israel. And it happened, David did justice and righteousness for all of his people.
\v 16 And Joab, the son of Zeruiah, {was} over the army, and Jehoshapat, the son of Ahilud, {was} the recorder.
\v 17 And Zadok, the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech, the son of Abiathar, {were} priests, and Seraiah {was} the scribe.
\v 18 And Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, both the Cherethites and the Pelethites, and the sons of David were priests.

\c 9
\p
\v 1 And David said, “{Is it} that there is still {one} who remains to the house of Saul, that I may do covenant faithfulness with him for the sake of Jonathan?”

\ts\*
\p
\v 2 Now to the house of Saul {was} a servant, and his name {was} Ziba. And they called him to David. And the king said to him, “{Are} you Ziba?”

\ts\*
\p
And he said, “Your servant.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 3 And the king said, “{Is there} no longer a man to the house of Saul, that I may do with him the covenant faithfulness of God?”

\ts\*
\p
And Ziba said to the king, “A son {is} still to Jonathan, lame of feet.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 4 And the king said to him, “Where {is} he?”

\ts\*
\p
And Ziba said to the king, “Behold, he {is at} the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, in Lo-Debar.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 5 Then King David sent, and he brought him from the house of Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lo-Debar.

\ts\*
\p
\v 6 And Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to David, and he fell on his face, and he prostrated himself.

\ts\*
\p
And David said, “Mephibosheth.”

\ts\*
\p
And he said, “Behold your servant.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 7 And David said to him, “Do not fear, for doing, I will do covenant faithfulness with you for the sake of Jonathan your father. And I will restore to you all of the field of Saul your father, and you yourself will eat bread at my table continually.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 8 And he prostrated himself, and he said, “What {is} your servant, that you should turn to a dead dog that {is} like me?”

\ts\*
\p
\v 9 And the king called to Ziba, the young man of Saul, and he said to him, “All that was to Saul and to all of his house, I have given to the son of your master.
\v 10 And you shall work the land for him, you and your sons and your servants, and you shall bring, that {there} will be bread for the son of your master, that he may eat it. And Mephibosheth, the son of your master, shall eat bread continually at my table.” (Now to Ziba {were} 15 sons and 20 servants.)

\ts\*
\p
\v 11 And Ziba said to the king, “According to all that my lord the king commands his servant, thus shall your servant do.” And Mephibosheth was eating “at my table” like one from the sons of the king.

\ts\*
\p
\v 12 Now to Mephibosheth {was} a young son, and his name {was} Mica. And all of the dwelling of the house of Ziba {were} servants to Mephibosheth.
\v 13 But Mephibosheth dwelled in Jerusalem, for he was continually eating at the table of the king. And he {was} lame, the two of his feet.

\c 10
\p
\v 1 And it happened after this that the king of the sons of Ammon died, and Hanun his son reigned in place of him.
\v 2 And David said, “I will do kindness with Hanun the son of Nahash, just as his father did kindness with me.” And David sent by the hand of his servants to console him concerning his father.

\ts\*
\p
And the servants of David entered the land of the sons of Ammon.
\v 3 And the commanders of the sons of Ammon said to Hanun their master, “In your eyes, is David honoring your father, since he has sent consolers to you? {Is it} not in order to explore the city and to spy on it and to overthrow it {that} David has sent his servants to you?”
\v 4 So Hanun took the servants of David, and he shaved half of their beard, and he cut their garments in the middle, to their buttocks, and he sent them away.

\ts\*
\p
\v 5 And they declared to David, and he sent to meet them, for the men were greatly humiliated. And the king said, “Stay in Jericho until your beard has grown, then you shall return.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 6 And the sons of Ammon saw that they had made themselves stink to David. So the sons of Ammon sent and hired Aram of Beth Rehob and Aram of Zoba, 20, 000 footsoldiers, and the king of Maacah, 1, 000 men, and a man of Tob, 12, 000 men.

\ts\*
\p
\v 7 And David heard, and he sent Joab and all of the army, the mighty.
\v 8 And the sons of Ammon came out and arrayed {for} battle {at} the entrance of the gate. And Aram of Zobah and Rehob and a man of Tob and Maacah {were} by themselves in the field.

\ts\*
\p
\v 9 And Joab saw that the faces of the battle were against him from before and from behind, and he chose from all of the chosen of Israel, and he arrayed {them} to meet Aram.
\v 10 And the rest of the people he put in the hand of Abishai his brother, and he arrayed {them} to meet the sons of Ammon.

\ts\*
\v 11 And he said, “If Aram is stronger than me, then you shall be to me for salvation, but if the sons of Ammon are stronger than you, then I will come to save you.
\v 12 Be strong, and let us use our strength for the sake of our people and for the sake of the cities of our God. And may Yahweh do the good in his eyes.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 13 Then Joab and the people who {were} with him approached for battle against Aram, and they fled from his face.
\v 14 And the sons of Ammon saw that Aram had fled, and they fled from the face of Abishai, and they entered the city. Then Joab returned from against the sons of Ammon, and he came {to} Jerusalem.

\ts\*
\p
\v 15 And Aram saw that it had been struck to the face of Israel, and they gathered themselves together.
\v 16 And Hadadezer sent, and he brought out Aram that {was} from beyond the River, and they came {to} Helam. And Shobach, the commander of the army of Hadadezer, {was} to their faces.

\ts\*
\p
\v 17 And it was declared to David, and he gathered all of Israel, and he crossed the Jordan, and he came toward Helam. And Aram arrayed themselves to meet David, and they fought with him.
\v 18 And Aram fled from the face of Israel, and David killed from Aram 700 charioteers and 40, 000 horsemen. And he struck Shobach, the commander of his army, and he died there.
\v 19 And all of the kings, servants of Hadadezer, saw that they had been struck to the face of Israel, and they made peace with Israel, and they served them.

\ts\*
\p
And Aram feared to save the sons of Ammon anymore.

\c 11
\p
\v 1 And it happened, at the return of the year, at the time of the going out of kings, that David sent Joab and his servants with him and all of Israel, and they destroyed the sons of Ammon, and they besieged against Rabbah. But David stayed in Jerusalem.

\ts\*
\p
\v 2 And it happened, at the time of the evening, that David arose from his bed and walked about on the roof of the house of the king. And from the roof he saw a woman bathing. And the woman {was} very good of appearance.
\v 3 And David sent and inquired about the woman. And one said, “Is this not Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?”
\v 4 And David sent messengers, and he took her. And she came to him, and he lay with her. (Now she had been sanctifying herself from her uncleanness.) And she returned to her house.
\v 5 Αnd the woman became pregnant, and she sent and declared to David, and she said, “I {am} pregnant.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 6 And David sent to Joab, “Send Uriah the Hittite to me.” So Joab sent Uriah to David.
\v 7 And Uriah came to him, and David asked about the welfare of Joab and about the welfare of the people and about the welfare of the war.
\v 8 And David said to Uriah, “Go down to your house, and wash your feet.” And Uriah went out from the house of the king, and a gift {from} the king went out after him.

\ts\*
\v 9 But Uriah lay down {at} the entrance of the house of the king with all of the servants of his master, and he did not go down to his house.

\ts\*
\p
\v 10 And they declared to David, saying, “Uriah did not go down to his house.” And David said to Uriah, “Are you not coming from a journey? Why did you not go down to your house?”

\ts\*
\p
\v 11 And Uriah said to David, “The Box and Israel and Judah are dwelling in tents, and my master Joab and the servants of my master {are} camping on the face of the field. And I, shall I go to my house to eat and to drink and to lie with my wife? Your life, and the life of your soul, I will not do this thing!”

\ts\*
\p
\v 12 And David said to Uriah, “Stay here today also, and tomorrow I will send you back.” So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem on that day and into the next day.
\v 13 And David called to him, and he ate to his face, and he drank, and he got him drunk. But he went out in the evening to lie down in his bed with the servants of his master, and he did not go down to his house.

\ts\*
\p
\v 14 And it happened in the morning that David wrote a letter to Joab, and he sent {it} by the hand of Uriah.
\v 15 And he wrote in the letter, saying, “Put Uriah in the front of the face of the strongest battle, and turn them back from behind him so he will be struck and die.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 16 And it happened, when Joab looked at the city, that he put Uriah in the place where he knew that men of valor {were} there.
\v 17 And the men of the city came out, and they fought with Joab, and some of the people from the servants of David fell. And Uriah the Hittite also died.

\ts\*
\p
\v 18 And Joab sent, and he declared to David all of the things of the battle.
\v 19 And he commanded the messenger, saying, “When you have finished to speak to the king all of the things of the battle,
\v 20 it will be, if the heat of the king rises and he says to you, ‘Why did you draw near to the city to fight? Did you not know that they would shoot from the wall?

\ts\*
\v 21 Who struck Abimelech, the son of Jerubbesheth? Did not a woman throw a piece of a millstone onto him from the wall, and he died in Thebez? Why did you draw near to the wall?’ then you shall say, ‘Your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead.’”

\ts\*
\p
\v 22 So the messenger went, and he came and declared to David all that Joab had sent him {to say}.
\v 23 And the messenger said to David that “the men became strong against us and they came out against us {to} the field, but we were against them to the entrance of the gate.

\ts\*
\v 24 And the shooters shot at your servants from the wall, and some of the servants of the king died, and also your servant Uriah the Hittite died.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 25 And David said to the messenger, “Thus you shall say to Joab, ‘May this matter not be bad in your eyes, for like this and like this the sword devours. Strengthen your battle against the city and destroy it.’ So strengthen him.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 26 And the wife of Uriah heard that Uriah her man had died. And she lamented for her husband.
\v 27 And the mourning passed, and David sent and gathered her to his house, and she became a wife to him, and she bore a son to him. But the thing that David had done was bad in the eyes of Yahweh.

\ts\*

\c 12
\p
\v 1 And Yahweh sent Nathan to David. And he came to him, and he said to him, “Two men were in one city, one rich and one poor.
\v 2 To the rich {one} was flock and herd very greatly.
\v 3 But to the poor {man} {was} not anything except one little ewe that he had bought. And he nourished it, and it grew up together with him and with his sons. It would eat from his morsel, and it would drink from his cup, and it would lie down in his lap. And it was like a daughter to him.

\ts\*
\p
\v 4 Now a traveler came to the rich man, and he spared to take from his flock or from his herd to prepare for the wayfarer having come to him, but he took the ewe of the poor man, and he prepared it for the man having come to him.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 5 And the nose of David burned greatly against the man, and he said to Nathan, “The life of Yahweh, that the man having done this {is} a son of death!
\v 6 Now he shall restore the ewe fourfold because he did this thing and because he did not spare.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 7 And Nathan said to David, “You {are} the man. Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel: ‘I, I anointed you as king over Israel, and I, I delivered you from the hand of Saul.
\v 8 And I gave to you the house of your master, and the wives of your master into your lap, and I gave to you the house of Israel and Judah. And if {this had been} little, then I would have added to you like them and like them.

\ts\*
\v 9 Why have you despised the word of Yahweh to do evil in my eyes? You struck Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and you took his wife for yourself as a wife, and you murdered him with the sword of the sons of Ammon.
\v 10 And now, the sword will not turn away from your house to forever, because you despised me and took the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be a wife for you.’

\ts\*
\p
\v 11 Thus says Yahweh, ‘Behold me, raising up harm against you from your house. And I will take your wives to your eyes, and I will give {them} to your neighbor. And he will lie with your wives to the eyes of this sun.
\v 12 For you, you did {this} in secret, but I, I will do this thing before all of Israel and before the sun.’”

\ts\*
\p
\v 13 And David said to Nathan, “I have sinned against Yahweh.”

\ts\*
\p
And Nathan said to David, “Yahweh has also taken away your sin. You will not die.
\v 14 Nevertheless, because spurning, you have spurned the enemies of Yahweh with this thing, also the son born to you dying, will die.”
\v 15 Then Nathan went to his home.

\ts\*
\p
And Yahweh struck the child whom the wife of Uriah had borne to David, and he became sick.
\v 16 And David sought God on behalf of the boy. And David fasted a fast, and he went in and lodged and lay on the ground.
\v 17 And the elders of his house arose upon him to make him arise from the ground, but he was not willing, and he would not eat bread with them.

\ts\*
\p
\v 18 And it happened on the seventh day that the child died, and the servants of David were afraid to declare to him that the child had died, for they said, “Behold, while the child was living, we spoke to him, but he did not listen to our voice. So how shall we say to him, ‘The child has died’? For he will do harm.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 19 And David saw that his servants were whispering together, and David realized that the child had died. So David said to his servants, “Has the child died?”

\ts\*
\p
And they said, “He has died.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 20 Then David arose from the ground, and he washed, and he anointed {himself}, and he changed his clothes, and he entered the house of Yahweh, and he prostrated himself. Then he went to his house, and he asked, and they set out bread for him, and he ate.

\ts\*
\p
\v 21 And his servants said to him, “What {is} this thing that you have done? For the sake of the living child you fasted and wept, but when the child died, you arose and ate bread.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 22 And he said, “When yet the child {was} alive, I fasted and wept, for I said, ‘Who knows? Yahweh may be gracious to me, and the child may live.’
\v 23 But now, he is dead. Why {is} this, {that} I should fast? Am I able to bring him back again? I am going to him, but he, he will not return to me.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 24 And David consoled Bathsheba his wife, and he came to her and lay with her. And she bore a son, and he called his name Solomon. And Yahweh loved him.
\v 25 And he sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet, and he called his name Jedidiah because of Yahweh.

\ts\*
\p
\v 26 And Joab fought with Rabbah of the sons of Ammon, and he captured the city of the kingdom.
\v 27 And Joab sent messengers to David, and he said, “I have fought against Rabbah. Also, I have captured the city of waters.
\v 28 And now, gather the rest of the people and encamp against the city and capture it, lest I myself capture the city and my name be called to it.

\ts\*
\p
\v 29 So David gathered all of the people, and he went to Rabbah. And he fought with it, and he captured it.
\v 30 And he took the crown of their king from his head, and its weight {was} a talent of gold, and a precious stone, and it became on the head of David. And he brought out the plunder of the city, very much.

\ts\*
\v 31 But the people who {were} in it, he brought out, and he set {them} with the saw and with picks of iron and with axes of iron, and he made them pass through at the brick kiln. And thus he did to all of the cities of the sons of Ammon. And David and all of the people returned {to} Jerusalem.

\ts\*
\p

\c 13
\p
\v 1 And it happened after this that to Absalom, the son of David, {was} a beautiful sister, and her name {was} Tamar, and Amnon, the son of David, loved her.

\ts\*
\p
\v 2 And it narrowed to Amnon, so that he made himself sick over Tamar his sister. For she {was} a virgin, so it was difficult in the eyes of Amnon to do anything to her.

\ts\*
\p
\v 3 Now to Amnon {was} a friend, and his name {was} Jonadab, the son of Shimeah the brother of David. And Jonadab {was} a very cunning man.
\v 4 And he said to him, “Why {are} you so weak, son of the king, by morning, by morning? Will you not declare to me?”

\ts\*
\p
And Amnon said to him, “I am loving Tamar, the sister of Absalom my brother.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 5 And Jonadab said to him, “Lie down on your bed and pretend to be sick. And your father will come to see you, and you shall say to him, ‘Please let Tamar my sister come and let her serve me bread, and let her make the food to my eyes so that I may see, and I will eat from her hand.’”

\ts\*
\p
\v 6 So Amnon lay down, and he pretended to be sick. And the king came to see him, and Amnon said to the king, “Please let Tamar my sister come, and let her make to my eyes a couple of pancakes, and I will eat from her hand.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 7 So David sent to Tamar at the house, saying, “Please go {to} the house of Amnon your brother and make food for him.”
\v 8 So Tamar went {to} the house of Amnon her brother, and he was lying down. And she took the dough, and she kneaded {it}, and she made pancakes to his eyes, and she cooked the pancakes.
\v 9 And she took the pan, and she poured {them} out to his face, but he refused to eat.

\ts\*
\p
And Amnon said, “Make every man go out from me.” So every man went out from him.

\ts\*
\p
\v 10 Then Amnon said to Tamar, “Bring the food {to} the bedroom, and I will eat from your hand.” So Tamar took the pancakes that she had made and brought {them} into the bedroom to Amnon her brother.
\v 11 And she brought {them} near to him to eat, and he seized her, and he said to her, “Come, lie with me, my sister.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 12 And she said to him, “No, my brother, do not humble me, for it is not done thus in Israel. Do not do this wickedness!

\ts\*
\v 13 And I, where would I bring my shame? And you, you would be like one of the wicked {ones} in Israel. And now, please, speak to the king, for he would not withhold me from you.”
\v 14 But he was not willing to listen to her voice. And he was stronger than she, and he humbled her, and he lay with her.

\ts\*
\p
\v 15 Then Amnon hated her {with} very great hatred, so that the hatred {with} which he hated her {was} greater than the love {with} which he had loved her. And Amnon said to her, “Arise, go.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 16 But she said to him, “No, because this great evil, to send me away, than the other that you did to me.”

\ts\*
\p
But he was not willing to listen to her.
\v 17 And he called his young man, the one attending him, and he said, “Now send this {one} away from me outside, and lock the door behind her.”

\ts\*
\v 18 Now a long robe {was} on her, for thus the virgin daughters of the king dressed {in} garments. And the one attending him brought her outside, and he locked the door behind her.
\v 19 And Tamar put ashes on her head, and she tore the long robe that {was} on her, and she put her hand on her head, and she went, going and she cried out.

\ts\*
\p
\v 20 And Absalom her brother said to her, “Has Amnon your brother been with you? And now, my sister, keep silent, he {is} your brother. Do not set your heart to this matter.” And Tamar dwelled and was desolate {in} the house of Absalom her brother.

\ts\*
\p
\v 21 And King David heard all of these things, and it burned to him greatly.
\v 22 But Absalom did not speak with Amnon to evil or to good, for Absalom hated Amnon for the reason that he had humbled Tamar his sister.

\ts\*
\p
\v 23 And it happened after two years of days that shearers were to Absalom in Baal Hazor, which {is} near Ephraim. And Absalom called to all of the sons of the king.
\v 24 And Absalom went to the king, and he said, “Behold, please, shearers {are} to your servant. May the king and his servants please go with your servant.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 25 And the king said to Absalom, “No, my son, please let not all of us go, and let us not be heavy to you.” Then he urged him, but he was not willing to go, but he blessed him.

\ts\*
\p
\v 26 And Absalom said, “If not, may Amnon my brother please go with us.”

\ts\*
\p
And the king said to him, “Why should he go with you?”
\v 27 But Absalom urged him, so he sent Amnon and all of the sons of the king with him.

\ts\*
\p
\v 28 And Absalom commanded his young men, saying, “See, now, when Amnon {is} good of heart with wine, and I say to you, ‘Strike Amnon!’ then you shall kill him. Do not fear. {Is it} not that I, I have commanded you? Be courageous and be sons of valor.”
\v 29 And the young men of Absalom did to Amnon just as Absalom had commanded. And all of the sons of the king arose, and they rode, a man on his mule, and they fled.

\ts\*
\p
\v 30 And it happened, they {were} on the road, and the report came to David, saying, “Absalom has struck all of the sons of the king, and not one of them is left.”
\v 31 And the king arose, and he tore his clothes, and he lay on the ground, and all of his servants were standing, torn of clothes.

\ts\*
\p
\v 32 But Jonadab, the son of Shimeah the brother of David, answered and said, “May my lord not say, ‘All of the young men, the sons of the king, have been killed,’ for Amnon alone has died. For it was placed on the mouth of Absalom from the day of his humbling Tamar his sister.
\v 33 And now, may my lord the king not put the matter to his heart, saying, ‘All of the sons of the king have died,’ for only Amnon has died.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 34 (Now Absalom had fled.) And the young man watching lifted his eyes, and he saw, and behold, many people were coming from the road behind him, from the side of the mountain.

\ts\*
\p
\v 35 And Jonadab said to the king, “Behold, the sons of the king are coming. As your servant spoke, thus it is.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 36 And it happened, as he finished speaking, that behold, the sons of the king came, and they lifted up their voice and wept. And the king and all of his servants also wept a very great weeping.

\ts\*
\p
\v 37 But Absalom fled, and he went to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son all of the days.

\ts\*
\p
\v 38 And Absalom fled, and he went {to} Geshur, and he was there three years.
\v 39 And it ceased, David the king to go out against Absalom, for he was comforted concerning Amnon, that he had died.

\ts\*
\p

\c 14
\p
\v 1 Now Joab the son of Zeruiah knew that the heart of the king {was} against Absalom.
\v 2 And Joab sent {to} Tekoa, and he brought a wise woman from there. And he said to her, “Please mourn, and please put on clothes of mourning. And you shall not anoint {yourself} {with} oil, but you shall be like this woman mourning many days for one having died.”
\v 3 And you shall come to the king, and you shall speak to him according to this word.” And Joab put the words in her mouth.

\ts\*
\p
\v 4 So the Tekoite woman spoke to the king. And she fell on her nose to the ground, and she prostrated herself, and she said, “Save, O king!”

\ts\*
\p
\v 5 And the king said to her, “What {is} to you?”

\ts\*
\p
And she said, “Truly I {am} a woman, a widow, for my husband has died.
\v 6 And to your maidservant {were} two sons. But the two of them fought in the field, and {there was} no deliverer between them. And the one struck him, the one, and he killed him.

\ts\*
\v 7 And behold, all of the clan has arisen against your maidservant, and they have said, ‘Give the one having struck his brother, and we will kill him for the life of his brother whom he slew, and let us destroy the heir also.’ And they would quench my coal that remains, without leaving to my husband a name or remnant on the face of the ground.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 8 And the king said to the woman, “Go to your house, and I, I will command concerning you.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 9 And the Tekoite woman said to the king, “On me, my lord the king, {be} the iniquity, and on the house of my father, and {may} the king and his throne {be} innocent.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 10 And the king said, “The one speaking to you, then bring him to me, and he will not continue to touch you further.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 11 And she said, “May the king please remember Yahweh your God, from the increasing of the avenger of blood to destroy. Then they will not destroy my son.”

\ts\*
\p
And he said, “The life of Yahweh, if from the hair of your son should fall to the ground!”

\ts\*
\p
\v 12 And the woman said, “May your maidservant please speak a word to my lord the king.”

\ts\*
\p
And he said, “Speak.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 13 And the woman said, “Then why have you devised like this against the people of God? For from speaking this word, the king {is} like the guilty, in that the king has not brought back his banished one.
\v 14 For dying, we will die, and like water spilled on the ground that is not gathered. But God does not take away life, but he devises devices so that the banished will not be banished from him.

\ts\*
\p
\v 15 “And now that I have come to speak this word to my lord the king, {it is} because the people have frightened me. And your maidservant said, ‘Let me now speak to the king. Perhaps the king will do the word of his female servant.
\v 16 For the king will listen to deliver his female servant from the palm of the man {who is} to destroy me and my son together from the inheritance of God.’

\ts\*
\p
\v 17 Then your maidservant said, ‘Now the word of my lord the king will be for rest, because like an angel of God, so {is} my lord the king, to understand good and evil.’ And may Yahweh your God be with you!’”

\ts\*
\p
\v 18 And the king answered and said to the woman, “Now do not hide from me a thing that I am asking you.”

\ts\*
\p
And the woman said, “May my lord the king please speak.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 19 And the king said, “{Is} the hand of Joab with you in all of this?”

\ts\*
\p
And the woman answered and said, “The life of your soul, my lord the king, if there is turning to the right or turning to the left from all that my lord the king has spoken. For your servant Joab, he, he commanded me, and he, he put all of these words in the mouth of your maidservant.
\v 20 In order to turn the face of the matter, your servant Joab did this thing. But my master {is} wise like the wisdom of an angel of God, to know everything that {is} in the land.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 21 And the king said to Joab, “Behold, I will now do this thing. So go, bring back the young man Absalom.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 22 And Joab fell on his face to the ground, and he prostrated himself, and he blessed the king. And Joab said, “Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your eyes, my lord the king, that the king does the word of his servant.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 23 And Joab arose and went to Geshur, and he brought Absalom {to} Jerusalem.
\v 24 Now the king had said, “He may return to his house, but my face he shall not see.” So Absalom returned to his house, but the face of the king he did not see.

\ts\*
\p
\v 25 Now {there} was not a handsome man like Absalom in all of Israel to praise greatly. From the sole of his foot and to his pate, no blemish was on him.
\v 26 And when he shaved his head (and it was at the end of years to years that he would shave, because {it was} heavy on him, so he would shave it) and he weighed the hair of his head, 200 shekels by the stone of the king.

\ts\*
\p
\v 27 And to Absalom were born three sons and one daughter, and her name {was} Tamar. She was a woman beautiful of appearance.

\ts\*
\p
\v 28 And Absalom lived in Jerusalem two years, days, but the face of the king he did not see.
\v 29 So Absalom sent to Joab to send him to the king, but he was not willing to come to him. So Absalom sent again a second time, but he was not willing to come.

\ts\*
\v 30 So he said to his servants, “See, the property of Joab {is} to my hand, and barley {is} to him there. Go and burn it with fire.” So the servants of Absalom burned the property with fire.

\ts\*
\p
\v 31 And Joab arose, and he came to Absalom, to the house, and he said to him, “Why did your servants burn with fire the property that {is} to me?”

\ts\*
\p
\v 32 And Absalom said to Joab, “Behold, I sent to you, saying, ‘Come here, that I may send you to the king, saying, “Why have I come from Geshur? {It would be} better for me {if} I {were} still there.”’ And now, let me see the face of the king, but if iniquity is in me, then let him kill me.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 33 So Joab came to the king, and he declared to him. And he called to Absalom, and he came to the king, and he prostrated himself to him on his nose to the ground to the face of the king. And the king kissed Absalom.

\ts\*
\p

\c 15
\p
\v 1 And it happened after this that Absalom made for himself a chariot and horses and 50 men running to his face.
\v 2 And Absalom would arise early, and he would stand at the hand of the way of the gate. And it happened, {when} any man to whom was a dispute came to the king for judgment, then Absalom would call to him, and he would say, “Where from this city {are} you?” And he would say, “Your servant {is} from one of the tribes of Israel.”

\ts\*
\v 3 Then Absalom would say to him, “See, your matter {is} good and right, but there is not a hearer for you from with the king.”
\v 4 And Absalom would say, “Who will appoint me a judge in the land, that every person to whom was a dispute and a judgment would come to me, and I would do him justice?”

\ts\*
\p
\v 5 And it happened, when a man approached to prostrate himself to him, that he would stretch out his hand and take hold of him and kiss him.
\v 6 And Absalom acted according to this matter for all of Israel who came to the king for judgment. And Absalom stole the heart of the men of Israel.

\ts\*
\p
\v 7 And it happened at the end of 40 years that Absalom said to the king, “Please may I go, and may I fulfill in Hebron my vow that I vowed to Yahweh.
\v 8 For your servant vowed a vow when I was living in Geshur in Aram, saying, ‘If bringing back, Yahweh brings me back {to} Jerusalem, then I will serve Yahweh.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 9 And the king said to him, “Go in peace.” So he arose and went to Hebron.

\ts\*
\p
\v 10 Then Absalom sent spies among all of the tribes of Israel, saying, “When you hear the sound of the shofar, then you shall say, ‘Absalom reigns in Hebron!’”

\ts\*
\v 11 Now 200 men from Jerusalem had gone with Absalom, called and walking in their innocence, and they did not know any of the matter.
\v 12 And Absalom sent {for} Ahithophel the Gilonite, the counselor of David, from his city, from Giloh, while he sacrificed the sacrifices. And it happened, the conspiracy {became} strong, and the people were going and many with Absalom.

\ts\*
\p
\v 13 And a declarer came to David, saying, “The heart of a man of Israel {is} behind Absalom.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 14 And David said to all of his servants who {were} with him in Jerusalem, “Arise, and let us flee, for there will not be for us an escape from the face of Absalom. Hurry to go, lest he hurry and overtake us and bring harm upon us and strike the city to the mouth of the sword.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 15 And the servants of the king said to the king, “According to all that my lord the king chooses, behold your servants.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 16 And the king went out, and all of his house {was} at his feet. And the king left ten women, concubines, to keep the house.
\v 17 And the king went out, and all of the people {were} at his feet. And they stopped {at} the farthest house.
\v 18 And all of his servants were passing by at his hand. And all of the Cherethites and all of the Pelethites and all of the Gittites, the 600 men who had come at his foot from Gath, were passing by to the face of the king.

\ts\*
\p
\v 19 But the king said to Ittai the Gittite, “Why are you also going with us? Return and dwell with the king, for you {are} a foreigner and you {are} also an exile to your place.
\v 20 Yesterday {was} your coming, and today shall I make you wander with us to go, when I am going upon where I am going? Return, and make your brothers return. {May} kindness and faithfulness {be} with you.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 21 But Ittai answered the king and said, “The life of Yahweh and the life of my lord the king, surely in the place where my lord the king will be there, whether to death, whether to life, that there your servant shall be.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 22 And David said to Ittai, “Go and pass by.” So Ittai the Gittite passed by, and all of his men and all of the little {ones} who {were} with him.

\ts\*
\p
\v 23 And all of the land was weeping {with} a great voice, and all of the people were crossing, and the king was crossing, over the Valley of Kidron, and all of the people were crossing to the face of the way of the wilderness.

\ts\*
\p
\v 24 And behold, Zadok and all of the Levites with him were also carrying the Box of the Covenant of God. And they set down the Box of God, but Abiathar went up until all of the people had finished passing from the city.

\ts\*
\p
\v 25 And the king said to Zadok, “Bring back the Box of God {to} the city. If I find favor in the eyes of Yahweh, then he will bring me back, and he will make me see it and his habitation.
\v 26 But if he says thus, ‘I do not delight in you,’ behold me, may he do to me just as {is} good in his eyes.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 27 And the king said to Zadok the priest, “Are you seeing? Return {to} the city in peace, and Ahimaaz your son and Jonathan the son of Abiathar, your two sons, with you.
\v 28 See, I will be waiting at the fords of the wilderness until word comes from you to declare to me.”
\v 29 So Zadok and Abiathar brought the Box of God back {to} Jerusalem, and they stayed there.

\ts\*
\p
\v 30 And David was going up onto the Mount of Olives, going up and weeping, and his head was covered, and he was walking barefoot. And all of the people who {were} with him covered, a man his head, and they went up, going up and weeping.
\v 31 And {to} David one declared, saying, “Ahithophel {is} among the conspirators with Absalom.” And David said, “Please, Yahweh, make foolish the counsel of Ahithophel.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 32 And it happened, David came to the top, where one would prostrate himself to God there, and behold, meeting him {was} Hushai the Archite. His robe was torn, and dirt {was} on his head.
\v 33 And David said to him, “If you pass along with me, you will become a burden to me.
\v 34 But if you return {to} the city and say to Absalom, ‘I {am} your servant, O king. I was the servant of your father, and {as} I {was} previously, and now, so I {will be} your servant,’ then you will break up the counsel of Ahithophel for me.

\ts\*
\v 35 {Will} not Zadok and Abiathar the priests {be} with you there? And may it be, every word that you hear from the house of the king, declare to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests.
\v 36 Behold, with them there {are} the two of their sons, Ahimaaz to Zadok and Jonathan to Abiathar. And you shall send to me by their hand every word that you hear.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 37 So Hushai the friend of David came {to} the city. And Absalom came {to} Jerusalem.

\ts\*
\p

\c 16
\p
\v 1 And David passed over a little from the top, and behold, meeting him {was} Ziba, the young man of Mephibosheth, and a pair of saddled donkeys, and on them 200 {loaves of} bread and 100 clusters of raisins and 100 summer fruit and a skin of wine.

\ts\*
\p
\v 2 And the king said to Ziba, “What {are} these to you?”

\ts\*
\p
And Ziba said, “The donkeys {are} for the house of the king to ride, and the bread and the summer fruit {are for} the young men to eat, and the wine {is for} the faint in the wilderness to drink.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 3 And the king said, “And where {is} the son of your master?”

\ts\*
\p
And Ziba said to the king, “Behold, he is staying in Jerusalem, for he said, ‘Today, the house of Israel will return the kingdom of my father to me.’”

\ts\*
\p
\v 4 And the king said to Ziba, “Behold, to you {is} all that {was} to Mephibosheth.”

\ts\*
\p
And Ziba said, “I prostrate myself. May I find favor in your eyes, my lord the king.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 5 And King David came to Bahurim. And behold, a man from the clan of the house of Saul was coming out from there, and his name {was} Shimei, the son of Gera. {He} was coming out, coming out and cursing.
\v 6 And he stoned David with stones and all of the servants of King David, and all of the people and all of the mighty {were} on his right and on his left.

\ts\*
\v 7 And thus Shimei said in his cursing, “Get out, get out, man of blood, man of wickedness!
\v 8 Yahweh has brought back upon you all of the blood of the house of Saul, in whose place you are king, and Yahweh has given the kingdom into the hand of Absalom your son. And behold you in your evil, for you {are} a man of blood.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 9 And Abishai the son of Zeruiah said to the king, “Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king? Please, let me go over and let me remove his head.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 10 And the king said, “What to me and to you, sons of Zeruiah? If he curses because Yahweh has said to him, ‘Curse David,’ then who shall say, ‘Why have you done thus’?”

\ts\*
\p
\v 11 And David said to Abishai and to all of his servants, “Behold, my son, who came out from my belly, is seeking my life. And how much more that now a Benjaminite! Leave him alone and let him curse, if Yahweh has spoken to him.
\v 12 Perhaps Yahweh will look at my affliction, and Yahweh will return good to me in place of his cursing this day.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 13 So David and his men walked on the road, and Shimei was walking on the side of the hill beside him, walking and he cursed, and he stoned with stones beside him, and he dusted with dust.
\v 14 And the king and all of the people who {were} with him came, weary. And he refreshed himself there.

\ts\*
\p
\v 15 And Absalom and all of the people, a man of Israel, came {to} Jerusalem, and Ahithophel {was} with him.
\v 16 And it happened, when Hushai the Archite, the friend of David, came to Absalom, that Hushai said to Absalom, “May the king live! May the king live!”

\ts\*
\p
\v 17 And Absalom said to Hushai, “{Is} this your loyalty to your friend? Why did you not go with your friend?”

\ts\*
\p
\v 18 And Hushai said to Absalom, “No, but whom Yahweh has chosen, and this people, and every man of Israel, to him I will be, and with him I will stay.

\ts\*
\v 19 And second, I, before whom shall I serve? {Is it} not to the face of his son? Just as I served to the face of your father, thus I will be to your face.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 20 And Absalom said to Ahithophel, “Give counsel for yourselves. What shall we do?”

\ts\*
\p
\v 21 And Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Go in to the concubines of your father whom he left to keep the house, and all of Israel will hear that you have made yourself stink with your father, and the hands of all who {are} with you will become strong.”

\ts\*
\v 22 So they spread a tent for Absalom on the roof, and Absalom went in to the concubines of his father to the eyes of all of Israel.

\ts\*
\p
\v 23 Now the counsel of Ahithophel that he counseled in those days {was} just as if one inquired of the word of God. Thus {was} all of the counsel of Ahithophel, both to David and to Absalom.

\ts\*
\p

\c 17
\p
\v 1 And Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Please let me choose 12, 000 men, and let me arise and pursue after David tonight.
\v 2 And I will come upon him, and he {will be} weary and weak of hands, and I will make him tremble, and all of the people who {are} with him will flee. And I will strike the king alone.
\v 3 And I will make all of the people return to you. Like the returning of all {is} the man whom you are seeking. All of the people will be {at} peace.”
\v 4 And the word was right in the eyes of Absalom and in the eyes of all of the elders of Israel.

\ts\*
\p
\v 5 But Absalom said, “Please also call to Hushai the Archite, and let us hear what {is} in his mouth, even he.”
\v 6 And Hushai came to Absalom, and Absalom spoke to him, saying, “According to this word, Ahithophel has spoken. Shall we do his word? If not, you speak.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 7 And Hushai said to Absalom, “The counsel that Ahithophel has counseled on this occasion is not good.”

\ts\*
\v 8 And Hushai said, “You, you know your father and his men, that they {are} warriors and they {are} bitter of soul, like a bear bereaved in the field. And your father {is} a man of war, so he will not lodge with the people.”
\v 9 Behold, he has now hidden himself in one of the pits or in one of the places. And it will be, when {some} among them fall in the beginning, the hearer will hear and say, ‘A slaughter has happened among the people who {are} behind Absalom.’
\v 10 And even he, a son of valor whose heart {is} like the heart of a lion, melting, he will melt, because all of Israel knows that your father {is} a warrior and {they} who {are} with him {are} sons of valor.

\ts\*
\p
\v 11 Therefore I counsel, being gathered, all of Israel shall be gathered to you, from Dan and to Beersheba, like the sand that {is} by the sea for multitude. And your face shall be going into the battle.
\v 12 And we will come upon him in one of the places where he may be found there, and we {will be} upon him just as the dew falls upon the ground. And not even one will be left of him or of any of the men who {are} with him.

\ts\*
\v 13 And if he gathers himself into a city, then all of Israel will bring ropes to that city, and we will drag it to the wadi until that not even a pebble will be found there.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 14 And Absalom and all of the men of Israel said, “The counsel of Hushai the Archite {is} better than the counsel of Ahithophel.” For Yahweh had appointed to break up the good counsel of Ahithophel for the sake of Yahweh bringing harm to Absalom.

\ts\*
\p
\v 15 Then Hushai said to Zadok and to Abiathar, the priests, “Like this and like this Ahithophel counseled Absalom and the elders of Israel, but like this and like this I, I have counseled.
\v 16 And now, send quickly and declare to David, saying, ‘Do not lodge tonight at the fords of the wilderness, but also crossing over, cross over, lest the king be swallowed and all of the people who {are} with him.’”

\ts\*
\p
\v 17 Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz were staying at En Rogel, and a maidservant would go and declare to them, and they, they would go and declare to King David, for they were not able to be seen entering the city.
\v 18 But a young man saw them, and he declared to Absalom. So the two of them went {in} haste, and they came to the house of a man in Bahurim, and to him {was} a well in his courtyard, and they went down there.

\ts\*
\v 19 And the woman took and stretched out a covering over the face of the well, and she spread grain over it, so the matter was not known.

\ts\*
\p
\v 20 And the servants of Absalom came to the woman {at} the house, and they said, “Where {are} Ahimaaz and Jonathan?”

\ts\*
\p
And the woman said to them, “They crossed over the brook of waters.” And they sought, but they did not find, so they returned {to} Jerusalem.

\ts\*
\p
\v 21 And it happened after they went that they came up from the well, and they went and declared to King David. And they said to David, “Arise and cross over the waters in haste, for according to this Ahithophel has counseled against you.”
\v 22 So David and all of the people who {were} with him arose and crossed the Jordan until the light of dawn, until not one was missing who had not crossed the Jordan.

\ts\*
\p
\v 23 And Ahithophel saw that his counsel was not done, and he saddled his donkey, and he arose and went to his house, to his city, and he commanded about his house, and he hanged himself, and he died. And he was buried in the grave of his father.

\ts\*
\p
\v 24 And David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom crossed the Jordan, he and all of the men of Israel with him.
\v 25 And Absalom appointed Amasa over the army in place of Joab. Now Amasa {was} the son of a man and his name {was} Ithra the Israelite, who had gone in to Abigail, the daughter of Nahash, the sister of Zeruiah the mother of Joab.
\v 26 And Israel and Absalom camped {in} the land of Gilead.

\ts\*
\p
\v 27 And it happened, when David came to Mahanaim, that Shobi, the son of Nahash, from Rabbah of the sons of Ammon and Machir, the son of Ammiel, from Lo Debar and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim,
\v 28 beds and basins and vessels of the potter and wheat and barley and flour and roasted grain and beans and lentils and roasted beans
\v 29 and honey and curds and sheep and cheese of cattle, they brought to David and to the people who {were} with him to eat, for they said, “The people {will be} hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness.”

\ts\*
\p

\c 18
\p
\v 1 And David counted the people who {were} with him, and he set over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds.
\v 2 And David sent out the people, a third in the hand of Joab and a third in the hand of Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, the brother of Joab, and a third in the hand of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the people, “Going out, I will go out, I too, with you.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 3 But the people said, “You shall not go out, for if fleeing, we flee, they will not set a heart to us. Even if half of us die, they will not set a heart to us. For now {there are} ten thousand like us. And now, {it is} better that you be help for us from the city.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 4 And the king said to them, “What is good in your eyes, I will do.”

\ts\*
\p
And the king stood at the hand of the gate, and all of the people went out by hundreds and by thousands.
\v 5 And the king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, “Gently for me with the young man, with Absalom.” And all of the people heard when the king commanded all of the commanders about the matter of Absalom.

\ts\*
\p
\v 6 And the people went out {to} the field to meet Israel, and the battle was in the Forest of Ephraim.
\v 7 And the people of Israel were struck there to the face of the servants of David. And the striking there was great on that day, 20, 000.
\v 8 And the battle was scattered there over the face of all of the land. And the forest made more to consume among the people than what the sword consumed on that day.

\ts\*
\p
\v 9 And Absalom was met to the face of the servants of David. Now Absalom was riding on the mule, and the mule came under the branches of a great oak tree, and his head was caught in the oak tree, and he was put between the heavens and between the earth, and the mule that {was} under him passed on.

\ts\*
\p
\v 10 And one man saw, and he declared to Joab, and he said, “Behold, I saw Absalom hung on an oak tree.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 11 And Joab said to the man declaring to him, “And behold, you saw, so why did you not strike him there to the ground? For {it was} to me to give to you ten silver and one belt.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 12 And the man said to Joab, “Even if I were weighing on my palm a thousand silver, I would not stretch out my hand against the son of the king. For in our ears the king commanded you and Abishai and Ittai, saying, ‘Guard who {is} upon the young man Absalom.’
\v 13 Otherwise I would have done wrong against my life, for every matter is not hidden from the king, and you, you would have stationed yourself from before {me}.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 14 And Joab said, “I will not wait thus to your face.” And he took three spears in his palm, and he thrust them into the heart of Absalom, he still {being} alive in the heart of the oak tree.
\v 15 And ten young men, carriers of the weapons of Joab, surrounded {him}. And they struck Absalom, and they killed him.

\ts\*
\p
\v 16 Then Joab blew on the shofar, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel, for Joab restrained the people.
\v 17 And they took Absalom, and they threw him into a great pit in the forest, and they set up a very great heap of stones over him. And all of Israel fled, a man to his tent.

\ts\*
\p
\v 18 Now while he was living, Absalom had taken and set up for himself a pillar, which {was} in the Valley of the King. For he said, “{There is} no son to me in order to make {people} remember my name.” And he called the pillar according to his name, and it is called the Hand of Absalom to this day.

\ts\*
\p
\v 19 And Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok, said, “Please let me run and let me bring news {to} the king, for Yahweh has judged him out of the hand of his enemies.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 20 But Joab said to him, “You {are} not a man of news this day, but you will bring news another day. But this day you will not bring news, because the son of the king is dead.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 21 Then Joab said to the Cushite, “Go, declare to the king what you have seen.” And the Cushite prostrated himself to Joab, then he ran.

\ts\*
\p
\v 22 And again Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok, resumed and said to Joab, “But whatever may be, please let me run, I too, after the Cushite.”

\ts\*
\p
And Joab said, “Why {is} this, you running, my son, when for you {there is} no news finding?”

\ts\*
\p
\v 23 “But whatever may be, let me run.”

\ts\*
\p
And he said to him, “Run.” And Ahimaaz ran the way of the plain, and he passed the Cushite.

\ts\*
\p
\v 24 Now David was sitting between the two gates, and the watcher went to the roof of the gate, on the wall, and he lifted his eyes, and he saw, and behold, a man running by himself.
\v 25 And the watcher called and declared to the king. And the king said, “If {he is} by himself, news {is} in his mouth.” And he came, coming and near.

\ts\*
\p
\v 26 And the watcher saw another man running, and the watcher called to the gatekeeper and said, “Behold, a man running by himself.”

\ts\*
\p
And the king said, “This {one} is also bringing news.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 27 And the watcher said, “I am seeing the running of the first like the running of Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok.”

\ts\*
\p
And the king said, “This {is} a good man, and he comes with good news.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 28 And Ahimaaz called and said to the king, “Peace!” And he prostrated himself to the king with his nose to the ground. And he said, “Blessed be Yahweh your God, who has enclosed the men who lifted their hand against my lord the king.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 29 And the king said, “{Is} peace to the young man, to Absalom?”

\ts\*
\p
And Ahimaaz said, “I saw a great tumult when Joab sent the servant of the king and your servant, but I do not know what.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 30 And the king said, “Turn aside, station yourself thus.” And he turned aside, and he stood.

\ts\*
\p
\v 31 And behold, the Cushite came. And the Cushite said, “May my lord the king receive the good news that Yahweh has judged you today out of the hand of all of the ones having arisen against you.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 32 And the king said to the Cushite, “{Is} peace to the young man, to Absalom?”

\ts\*
\p
And the Cushite said, “May the enemies of my lord the king and all who arise against you for harm be like the young man.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 33 And the king trembled, and he went up to the upper room of the gate, and he wept. And thus he said as he went: “My son Absalom! My son, my son, Absalom! Who will give my dying myself in place of you? Absalom, my son, my son!”

\ts\*
\p

\ts\*
\p

\c 19
\p
\v 1 And it was declared to Joab, “Behold, the king is weeping and mourning for Absalom.”
\v 2 And the victory on that day became mourning for all of the people, for the people heard on that day, saying, “The king is grieved because of his son.”

\ts\*
\v 3 And the people stole away on that day to enter the city, as ashamed people steal away when they flee in battle.
\v 4 And the king covered his face, and the king cried out {with} a loud voice, “My son Absalom! Absalom, my son, my son!”

\ts\*
\p
\v 5 And Joab came to the king, {to} the house, and he said, “Today you have shamed the faces of all of your servants, the ones having rescued your life today and the life of your sons and your daughters and the life of your wives and the life of your concubines,
\v 6 by loving the ones hating you and by hating the ones loving you. For you have declared today that the commanders and servants {are} nothing to you. For I know today that if Absalom {were} alive and all of us were dead today, that then {it would be} right in your eyes.

\ts\*
\v 7 But now, arise, go out and speak to the heart of your servants, for I swear by Yahweh, if you are not going out, if a man will lodge with you tonight, and this {will be} more trouble for you than all of the trouble that has come on you from your youth until now.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 8 So the king arose and sat in the gate.

\ts\*
\p
And they declared to all of the people, saying, “Behold, the king is sitting in the gate.” And all of the people came to the face of the king. But Israel had fled, a man to his tent.

\ts\*
\p
\v 9 And it happened, all of the people were contending in all of the tribes of Israel, saying, “The king delivered us from the palm of our enemies, and he, he rescued us from the palm of the Philistines. But now he has fled from the land, away from Absalom.
\v 10 But Absalom, whom we anointed over us, has died in the battle. And now, why are you being silent about bringing back the king?”

\ts\*
\p
\v 11 And King David sent to Zadok and to Abiathar, the priests, saying, “Speak to the elders of Judah, saying, ‘Why are you the last to bring back the king to his house? For the word of all of Israel has come to the king, to his house.
\v 12 You {are} my brothers. You {are} my bone and my flesh. So why are you last to bring back the king?’

\ts\*
\v 13 And to Amasa you shall say, ‘{Are} you not my bone and my flesh? Thus may God do to me, and thus may he add, if you are not the commander of the army to my face all of the years in place of Joab.’”

\ts\*
\p
\v 14 And he inclined the heart of every man of Judah as one man. And they sent to the king, “Return, you and all of your servants.”
\v 15 And the king returned, and he came to the Jordan.

\ts\*
\p
And Judah came to Gilgal to go to meet the king to bring the king across the Jordan.
\v 16 And Shimei, the son of Gera, the Benjaminite, who {was} from Bahurim, hurried and came down with a man of Judah to meet King David,
\v 17 and 1, 000 men {were} with him from Benjamin. And Ziba, the young man of the house of Saul, and his 15 sons and his 20 servants {were} with him. And they rushed {into} the Jordan to the face of the king.
\v 18 And they crossed the ford to bring over the house of the king and to do the good in his eyes.

\ts\*
\p
And Shimei, the son of Gera, fell to the face of the king when he crossed in the Jordan.
\v 19 And he said to the king, “May my lord not reckon iniquity to me, and may you not remember that your servant committed iniquity on the day that my lord the king went out from Jerusalem, for the king to set {it} to his heart.
\v 20 For your servant knows that I, I have sinned, and behold, I have come today, the first of all of the house of Joseph to come down to meet my lord the king.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 21 And Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, answered and said, “In place of this, shall not Shimei be killed? For he cursed the anointed of Yahweh.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 22 And David said, “What to me and to you, sons of Zeruiah, that you have become an adversary to me today? Shall a man be killed in Israel today? For do I not know that I {am} king over Israel today?”
\v 23 And the king said to Shimei, “You shall not die.” And the king swore to him.

\ts\*
\p
\v 24 And Mephibosheth, the son of Saul, came down to meet the king. And he had not done his feet, and he had not done his mustache, and he had not washed his clothes from the day the king went up to the day that he came in peace.
\v 25 And it happened that he came {from} Jerusalem to meet the king. And the king said to him, “Why did you not go with me, Mephibosheth?”

\ts\*
\p
\v 26 And he said, “My lord the king, my servant deceived me, for your servant said, ‘Let me saddle a donkey for myself, and let me ride on it, and let me go with the king.’ For your servant {is} lame.
\v 27 And he slandered your servant to my lord the king. But my lord the king {is} like an angel of God, so do the good in your eyes.
\v 28 For all of the house of my father was nothing except men of death to my lord the king, but you set your servant among the eaters at your table. So what right is there still for me to cry out more to the king?”

\ts\*
\p
\v 29 And the king said to him, “Why do you still speak your words? I have said, ‘You and Ziba shall divide the field.’”

\ts\*
\p
\v 30 And Mephibosheth said to the king, “Let him even take the whole, after that my lord the king has come in peace to his house.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 31 And Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim. And he crossed the Jordan with the king to send him {across} the Jordan.
\v 32 Now Barzillai had aged greatly, a son of 80 years. And he, he had sustained the king in his stay in Mahanaim, for he {was} a very great man.
\v 33 And the king said to Barzillai, “You, cross over with me, and I will sustain you with me in Jerusalem.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 34 But Barzillai said to the king, “How many {will be} the days of the years of my life, that I should go up with the king {to} Jerusalem?
\v 35 I {am} a son of 80 years today. Do I know between good to bad? Or does your servant taste what I eat or what I drink? Or do I still hear the voice of the {male} singers or the {female} singers? So why should your servant become a further burden to my lord the king?”
\v 36 According to a little your servant will go across the Jordan with the king. But why will the king reward me this reward?

\ts\*
\v 37 Please let your servant return, and let me die in my city by the grave of my father and my mother. But behold your servant Chimham. Let him cross over with my lord the king, and do for him what {is} good in your eyes.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 38 And the king said, “Chimham shall cross over with me, and I, I shall do for him the good in your eyes. And all that you choose upon me, I shall do for you.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 39 And all of the people crossed the Jordan, and the king crossed. And the king kissed Barzillai, and he blessed him, and he returned to his place.

\ts\*
\p
\v 40 And the king passed on to Gilgal, and Chimham passed on with him. And all of the people of Judah brought the king over, and also half of the people of Israel.

\ts\*
\p
\v 41 And behold, all of the men of Israel were coming to the king, and they said to the king, “Why did our brothers, the men of Judah, steal you away and bring the king and his house across the Jordan and all of the men of David with him?”

\ts\*
\p
\v 42 And each man of Judah answered to a man of Israel, “Because the king {is} near to me. And why this, it burns to you about this matter? Eating, have we eaten from the king? Or being taken, has it been taken for us?”

\ts\*
\p
\v 43 And a man of Israel answered a man of Judah, and he said, “Ten hands {are} to me in the king, and also in David, I more than you. So why have you despised me? Was not my word first, to bring back my king to me?”

\ts\*
\p
But the word of a man of Judah was harsher than the word of a man of Israel.

\ts\*
\p

\c 20
\p
\v 1 And a man of wickedness was met there, and his name {was} Sheba, the son of Bichri, a man of Benjamin. And he blew on a shofar, and he said, “{There} is no portion to us in David, and no inheritance {is} to us in the son of Jesse. A man to his tents, Israel!”

\ts\*
\p
\v 2 And all of the men of Israel went up from after David {to} after Sheba, the son of Bichri. But the men of Judah clung to their king from the Jordan and to Jerusalem.

\ts\*
\p
\v 3 And David came to his house {in} Jerusalem, and the king took the ten concubine wives whom he had left to keep the house, and he put them {in} a house of keeping, and he sustained them, but he did not go in to them. And they were confined until the day of their death, a widowhood of life.

\ts\*
\p
\v 4 And the king said to Amasa, “Call up the men of Judah to me, three days. And you, stand here.”
\v 5 And Amasa went to call up Judah, but he delayed beyond the appointment that he had appointed him.

\ts\*
\p
\v 6 And David said to Abishai, “Now Sheba, the son of Bichri, will harm us more than Absalom. You, take the servants of your lord and pursue after him, lest he find fortified cities for himself and remove our eyes.”
\v 7 And the men of Joab and the Cherethites and the Pelethites and all of the warriors went out after him. And they went out from Jerusalem to pursue after Sheba, the son of Bichri.

\ts\*
\p
\v 8 They {were} near the great stone that {is} in Gibeon, and Amasa came to their faces. Now Joab was girded {with}his garment {as} his clothing, and on him {was} a belt of a sword strapped on his waist in its sheath. And he, he went out, and it fell.

\ts\*
\p
\v 9 And Joab said to Amasa, “Peace {to} you, my brother?” And the right hand of Joab held onto the beard of Amasa to kiss him.
\v 10 But Amasa did not guard himself against the sword that {was} in the hand of Joab. And he struck him with it in the stomach, and his intestines poured out to the ground, and he did not do again to him, and he died. And Joab and Abishai his brother pursued after Sheba, the son of Bichri.

\ts\*
\p
\v 11 And a man from the young men of Joab stood beside him, and he said, “Whoever delights in Joab and whoever {is} to David, after Joab!”
\v 12 Now Amasa was rolling himself in blood in the midst of the road. And the man saw that all of the people stood. So he removed Amasa from the road {to} a field, and he threw a garment over him, because he saw everyone coming to him, that he stood.
\v 13 When he had pushed {him} from the road, each man passed on after Joab to pursue after Sheba, the son of Bichri.

\ts\*
\p
\v 14 And he passed through all of the tribes of Israel to Abel and Beth Maacah. And all of the Berites, now they gathered themselves, and they also came after him.
\v 15 And they came, and they besieged against him in Abel Beth Maacah. And they poured out a mound against the city, and it stood against the rampart. And all of the people who {were} with Joab were destroying to make the wall fall.
\v 16 But a wise woman called from the city, “Listen, listen! Please say to Joab, ‘Approach to here, and let me speak to you.’”

\ts\*
\p
\v 17 And he approached to her, and the woman said, “{Are you} Joab?”

\ts\*
\p
And he said, “I {am}.”

\ts\*
\p
And she said to him, “Hear the words of your female servant.”

\ts\*
\p
And he said, “I am listening.”
\v 18 So she spoke, saying, “Speaking, they spoke in former {times}, saying, ‘Inquiring, they shall inquire at Abel,’ and thus they ended.
\v 19 I {am} pacified and faithful {ones} of Israel. You are seeking to kill a city and a mother in Israel. Why will you devour the inheritance of Yahweh?”

\ts\*
\p
\v 20 And Joab answered and said, “Profane, profane to me if I should devour or if I should destroy!
\v 21 The matter {is} not thus, but a man from the hill country of Ephraim—Sheba, the son of Bichri, is his name—has lifted his hand against the king, against David. Give him alone, and let me go from the city.”

\ts\*
\p
And the woman said to Joab, “Behold, his head will be thrown to you over the wall.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 22 And the woman came to all of the people in her wisdom, and they cut off the head of Sheba, the son of Bichri, and they threw {it} to Joab. And he blew on the shofar, and they dispersed from the city, a man to his tent. And Joab returned {to} Jerusalem, to the king.

\ts\*
\p
\v 23 Now Joab {was} over all of the army of Israel. And Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, {was} over the Cherethites and over the Pelethites.
\v 24 And Adoniram {was} over the forced labor, and Jehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud, {was} the recorder.
\v 25 And Sheva {was} the scribe, and Zadok and Abiathar {were} priests.
\v 26 And also Ira the Jairite was a priest to David.

\ts\*
\p

\c 21
\p
\v 1 Now {there} was a famine in the days of David three years, year after year. And David sought the face of Yahweh, and Yahweh said, “To Saul and to the house {is} blood, because he killed the Gibeonites.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 2 And the king called to the Gibeonites, and he spoke to them. (Now the Gibeonites {were} not from the sons of Israel. Rather, they {were} from the remnant of the Amorite. And the sons of Israel had sworn to them, but Saul sought to strike them when he was jealous for the sons of Israel and Judah.)
\v 3 And David said to the Gibeonites, “What shall I do for you, and with what shall I atone, then bless the inheritance of Yahweh?”

\ts\*
\p
\v 4 And the Gibeonites said to him, “{There is} no silver or gold for us with Saul or with his house. And {there is} not for us a man to kill in Israel.”

\ts\*
\p
And he said, “What are you saying I shall do for you?”

\ts\*
\p
\v 5 And they said to the king, “The man who ended us and who intended against us {that} we should be destroyed from stationing ourselves in all of the border of Israel,
\v 6 let seven men from his sons be given to us, and we will hang them before Yahweh at Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of Yahweh.”

\ts\*
\p
And the king said, “I, I will give.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 7 Now the king had compassion on Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, because of the oath of Yahweh that {was} between them, between David and between Jonathan, the son of Saul.
\v 8 But the king took two of the sons of Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth, and five of the sons of Michal, the daughter of Saul, whom she bore to Adriel, the son of Barzillai the Meholathite.
\v 9 And he gave them into the hand of the Gibeonites, and they hanged them on the hill to the face of Yahweh, and the seven of them fell together. And they, they were killed in the days of the harvest, in the first {days}, at the beginning of the harvest of barley.

\ts\*
\p
\v 10 And Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, took sackcloth, and she spread it for herself against a rock, from the beginning of the harvest until water was poured on them from the heavens. And she did not allow a bird of the heavens to rest on them by day or a beast of the field by night.
\v 11 And it was declared to David what Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done.

\ts\*
\p
\v 12 And David went, and he took the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son from the lords of Jabesh Gilead, who had stolen them from the open area of Beth Shan, where the Philistines had hanged them there on the day the Philistines struck Saul at Gilboa.
\v 13 And he brought up from there the bones of Saul and the bones of Jonathan his son, and they gathered the bones of the hanged ones.

\ts\*
\p
\v 14 And they buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the land of Benjamin, in Zela, in the tomb of Kish his father. And they did all that the king commanded. And God was entreated for the land after this.

\ts\*
\p
\v 15 Now war was to the Philistines again with Israel. And David went down, and his servants with him, and they fought the Philistines. And David wearied.
\v 16 And Ishbi Benob, who {was} among the children of Rapha, and the weight of his spear {was} 300 {shekels} of bronze in weight, and he was girded {with} a new {weapon}, and he said to strike David.
\v 17 But Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, helped him, and he struck the Philistine, and he killed him. Then the men of David adjured him, saying, “You shall not go out with us to battle anymore, so you do not extinguish the lamp of Israel.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 18 And it happened after this that {there} was a battle again with the Philistines, at Gob. Then Sibbecai the Hushathite struck Saph, who {was} among the children of Rapha.

\ts\*
\p
\v 19 And {there} was battle again with the Philistines at Gob. And Elhanan, the son of Jaare Oregim the Bethlehemite, struck Goliath the Gittite, and the wood of his spear {was} like the beam of weavers.

\ts\*
\p
\v 20 And {there} was battle again at Gath, and {there} was a man of stature, and the digits of his hands and the digits of his feet {were} six and six, 24 {in} number. And he also was born to Rapha.
\v 21 And he taunted Israel, and Jonathan, the son of Shimeah, the brother of David, struck him.

\ts\*
\p
\v 22 These four were born to Rapha in Gath. And they fell by the hand of David and by the hand of his servants.

\ts\*
\p

\c 22
\p
\v 1 And David spoke to Yahweh the words of this song on the day Yahweh delivered him from the palm of all of his enemies and from the palm of Saul.
\v 2 And he said, “Yahweh {is} my rock and my stronghold and my deliverer, mine.
\v 3 God of my rock, I take refuge in him, my shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold and my refuge, my savior, you save me from violence.

\ts\*
\p
\v 4 {To} the one being praised I call, {to} Yahweh, and I am saved from my enemies.
\v 5 For the waves of death surrounded me, the torrents of wickedness terrified me.
\v 6 The cords of Sheol surrounded me, the snares of death confronted me.

\ts\*
\p
\v 7 In my distress I called {to} Yahweh, and to my God I called. And he heard my voice from his temple, and my cry {was} in his ears.
\v 8 Then the earth shook and trembled. The foundations of the heavens quaked and shook themselves, because it burned to him.
\v 9 Smoke went up from his nose, and fire from his mouth devoured. Coals from him burned.
\v 10 And he lowered the heavens, and he came down, and a dark cloud {was} under his feet.
\v 11 And he rode on a cherub, and he flew. He was seen on the wings of the wind.
\v 12 And he set darkness, the booths around him {were} a gathering of waters, clouds of the skies.
\v 13 From the brightness before him, coals of fire burned.
\v 14 Yahweh thundered from the heavens, the Most High uttered his voice.
\v 15 And he sent out arrows, and he scattered them, lightning, and he panicked them.
\v 16 And the valleys of the sea were seen, the foundations of the world were uncovered, at the rebuke of Yahweh, from the blast of the breath of his nose.

\ts\*
\p
\v 17 He stretched out from the height, he took hold of me. He drew me out of many waters.
\v 18 He delivered me from my strong enemy, from the ones hating me, for they were stronger than me.
\v 19 They confronted me on the day of my calamity, but Yahweh was my support.
\v 20 And he brought me out to an open space.

\ts\*
\p
He delivered me because he delighted in me.
\v 21 Yahweh has rewarded me according to my righteousness. According to the cleanness of my hands, he has given back to me.
\v 22 For I have kept the ways of Yahweh, and I have not been wicked from my God.
\v 23 For all of his judgments {are} before me, and his statutes, I have not turned away from them.
\v 24 And I have been blameless toward him, and I have kept myself from my iniquity.
\v 25 And Yahweh has given back to me according to my righteousness, according to my cleanness before his eyes.

\v 26 To the faithful you show yourself faithful; with the mighty blameless, you show yourself blameless.
\v 27 With the purified, you show yourself pure, but with the crooked, you show yourself cunning.
\v 28 And you save a lowly people, but your eyes {are} against the ones being high, you bring {them} down.

\ts\*
\p
\v 29 For you {are} my lamp, Yahweh, and Yahweh lightens my darkness.
\v 30 For by you, I run {after} a troop.

\ts\*
\p
By my God, I leap {over} a wall.
\v 31 This God, his way {is} perfect. The word of Yahweh is refined. He {is} a shield to all of the ones taking refuge in him.
\v 32 For who {is} God except Yahweh? And who {is} a rock except our God?
\v 33 This God {is} my fortress of strength, and he makes my way perfect,
\v 34 making my feet like a deer, and he makes me stand on my high places,
\v 35 training my hands for war, and my arms bend a bow of bronze.
\v 36 And you give to me the shield of your salvation, and your answer makes me great.
\v 37 You enlarge my step under me, and my feet do not slip.

\ts\*
\p
\v 38 I pursue my enemies, and I destroy them, and I do not return until I have ended them.
\v 39 And I devour them, and I shatter them, and they do not arise, but they fall under my feet.
\v 40 And you gird me {with} valor for war; you make the ones rising up under me bow down.
\v 41 And my enemies, you give to me the back of {their} neck; the ones hating me, and I destroy them.
\v 42 They look, but {there is} no one saving; to Yahweh, but he does not answer them.
\v 43 And I beat them like the dust of the earth.

\ts\*
\p
Like the mud of the streets, I pulverize them, I stomp them.
\v 44 And you rescue me from the disputes of my people. You keep me as the head of nations. People I did not know serve me.
\v 45 Sons of the foreigner come cringing to me. At the hearing of an ear, they hear me.
\v 46 Sons of the foreigner fade away, and they come trembling from their fortresses.

\ts\*
\p
\v 47 Yahweh {is} alive! And blessed {be} my rock, and may the God of the rock of my salvation be exalted,
\v 48 the God giving vengeance to me and bringing down peoples under me
\v 49 and bringing me out from my enemies.

\ts\*
\p
And from the ones arising {against} me, you lift me up; from a man of violences, you deliver me.
\v 50 Therefore I thank you, Yahweh, among the nations, and I sing praise to your name,
\v 51 the one magnifying the salvation of his king and doing covenant faithfulness to his anointed, to David, and to his seed until forever.”

\v 1 Now these {are} the last words of David. An oracle of David the son of Jesse, and an oracle of the man raised {to} height, the anointed of the God of Jacob, and the delightful {one} of the songs of Israel.

\v 2 “The Spirit of Yahweh spoke by me, and his word {was} on my tongue.
\v 3 The God of Israel spoke to me, the Rock of Israel said, ‘A righteous one ruling over man {is} ruling {in} the fear of God,
\v 4 and {is} like the light of morning, {when} the sun rises, a morning {with} no clouds, {like} grass from the earth from brightness after rain.’

\ts\*
\p
\v 5 For {is} not my house thus with God? For he has made a covenant with me forever, ordered in everything and secured. For all my salvation and every desire, surely will he not make {it} sprout?
\v 6 But the wicked, all of them, {will be} like a thorn thrown away because they do not take in the hand.
\v 7 But the man {who} touches them will be filled {with} iron or the wood of a spear. And burning, they will be burned in the fire in place.”

\ts\*

\v 8 These {are} the names of the warriors who {were} to David. Josheb Basshebeth the Tahchemonite {was} the head of the Three. He was lifting his spear against 800, slain at one time.

\ts\*
\p
\v 9 And after him {was} Eleazar the son of Dodo, the son of Ahohi, among the three warriors with David. When they taunted the Philistines, they had gathered themselves there for battle, and the men of Israel went up,
\v 10 he, he arose and struck the Philistines until his hand tired and his hand clung to the sword. And Yahweh did great salvation on that day, and the people returned after him only to plunder.

\ts\*
\p
\v 11 And after him {was} Shammah, the son of Agee the Hararite. Now the Philistines gathered themselves to Lehi, and a portion of the field there was full {of} lentils, and the people fled from the face of the Philistines.
\v 12 But he stationed himself in the midst of the portion, and he delivered it, and he struck the Philistines. And Yahweh did great salvation.

\ts\*
\p
\v 13 And three from the head Thirty went down, and they came to the harvest, to David, to the cave of Adullam. And a troop of Philistines was camping in the Valley of the Raphaites.
\v 14 And David {was} then in the stronghold, and a garrison of the Philistines {was} then {in} Bethlehem.
\v 15 And David desired, and he said, “Who will give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem that {is} at the gate?”
\v 16 And the three warriors broke through the camp of the Philistines, and they drew water from the well of Bethlehem that {is} at the gate. And they carried {it} away and brought {it} to David. But he was not willing to drink it, and he poured it out to Yahweh.
\v 17 And he said, “Profane to me, Yahweh, from my doing this, the blood of the men having gone with their lives!” And he was not willing to drink it.

\ts\*
\p  These {things} the three warriors did.

\ts\*
\p
\v 18 And Abishai, the brother of Joab, the son of Zeruiah, he {was} the head of the three, and he was lifting his spear against 300, slain. And to him {was} a name among the Three.
\v 19 {Is it not} that he was the most honored of the three? And he became to them a commander. But he did not come to the Three.

\ts\*
\p
\v 20 And Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, {was} a son of a man of valor, many deeds, from Kabzeel. He, he struck the two Ariel of Moab. And he, he went down and struck a lion in the midst of the pit on a day of snow.
\v 21 And he himself struck a man of Egypt, a man of appearance. Now in the hand of the Egyptian {was} a spear, and he went down against him with a staff. But he seized the spear from the hand of the Egyptian, and he killed him with his spear.
\v 22 These {things}, Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada did. And to him {was} a name among the three warriors.
\v 23 More than the Thirty, he was honored, but to the Three, he did not come.

\ts\*

And David put him to his bodyguard.
\v 24 Asahel the brother of Joab {was} among the Thirty; Elhanan, the son of Dodo {of} Bethlehem;

\v 1 And the nose of Yahweh added to burn against Israel, and he incited David against them, saying, “Go, count Israel and Judah.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 2 And the king said to Joab, the commander of the army that {was} with him, “Go about, please, among all of the tribes of Israel, from Dan and to Beersheba, and muster the people, that I may know the number of the people.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 3 And Joab said to the king, “Now may Yahweh your God add to the people like them and like them a hundred times, and may the eyes of my lord the king be seeing. But my lord the king, why does he delight in this matter?”

\ts\*
\p
\v 4 But the word of the king prevailed against Joab and over the commanders of the army. So Joab and the commanders of the army went out to the face of the king to muster the people, Israel.

\ts\*
\p
\v 5 And they crossed the Jordan, and they camped at Aroer, south of the city that {is} in the midst of the wadi, Gad and to Jazer.
\v 6 And they came to Gilead and to the land of Tahtim Hodshi. And they came to Dan Jaan, and around to Sidon.
\v 7 And they came {to} the fortress of Tyre and {to} all of the cities of the Hivites and the Canaanites. And they went out to the Negev of Judah, {to} Beersheba.

\ts\*
\p
\v 8 So they went about in all of the land. And they came, at the end of nine months and twenty days, {to} Jerusalem.

\ts\*
\p
\v 9 And Joab gave the number of the mustering of the people to the king. And Israel was 800, 000 men of valor drawing the sword, and the men of Judah {were} 500, 000 men.

\ts\*
\p
\v 10 But the heart of David struck him after this, he had counted the people. And David said to Yahweh, “I have sinned greatly {by} what I have done. But now, Yahweh, please take away the iniquity of your servant, for I have acted very foolishly.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 11 And David arose in the morning, and the word of Yahweh was to Gad, the prophet, a seer of David, saying,
\v 12 “Go, and you shall say to David, ‘Thus says Yahweh, “Three I am lifting over you. Choose for yourself one from them, and I will do {it} to you.”’”

\ts\*
\p
\v 13 And Gad came to David, and he declared to him. Then he said to him, “Shall seven years of famine come to you in your land, or three months of your fleeing to the face of your enemies and he is pursuing you, or three days of plague being in your land? Now, know and see what word I shall return {to} the one having sent me.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 14 And David said to Gad, “Great distress {is} to me. Please, let us fall into the hand of Yahweh, for his mercies {are} many, but into the hand of man, do not let me fall.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 15 And Yahweh caused a plague in Israel from the morning and until the time of appointment. And from the people, from Dan and to Beersheba, 70, 000 men died.
\v 16 And the angel stretched out his hand {against} Jerusalem to destroy it, but Yahweh relented concerning the harm. And he said to the angel, the destroyer among the many people, “Now lower your hand.” And the angel of Yahweh was near the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.

\ts\*
\p
\v 17 And David spoke to Yahweh when he saw the angel, the striker among the people, and he said, “Behold, I, I have sinned, and I, I have committed iniquity. But these sheep, what have they done? Please, let your hand be against me and against the house of my father.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 18 And Gad came to David on that day, and he said to him, “Go up, set up an altar for Yahweh on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.”
\v 19 So David went up according to the word of Gad, just as Yahweh had commanded.
\v 20 And Araunah looked down, and he saw the king and his servants coming over to him. And Araunah went out, and he prostrated himself to the king, his nose to the ground.

\ts\*
\p
\v 21 And Araunah said, “Why has my lord the king come to his servant?”

\ts\*
\p
And David said, “To buy from you the threshing floor to build an altar for Yahweh, that the plague may be restrained from against the people.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 22 And Araunah said to David, “May my lord the king take and offer up the good in his eyes. See, the oxen for the burnt offering and the threshing instruments and the equipment of the oxen for wood.
\v 23 Everything, Araunah gives, O king, to the king.” And Araunah said to the king, “May Yahweh your God be pleased with you.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 24 And the king said to Araunah, “No, but buying, I will buy {it} from you for a price. For I will not offer to Yahweh my God burnt offerings for nothing.”

\ts\*
\p
So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for silver, 50 shekels.
\v 25 And David built an altar there for Yahweh, and he offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. And Yahweh was entreated for the land, and the plague was restrained from against Israel.
