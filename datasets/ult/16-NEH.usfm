\v 1 The words of Nehemiah the son of Hakaliah:
\p
And it happened in the month of Kislev, in year 20, that I myself was in Susa the citadel.
\v 2 And Hanani, one of my brothers, came, he and men from Judah. And I asked them about the Jews who escaped, who were left behind from the captivity, and about Jerusalem.
\p
\v 3 And they said to me, “The ones left behind, who were left behind from the captivity there in the province, are in great evil and in reproach. And the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its gates have been burned with fire.”
\p
\v 4 And it happened that, when I heard these words, I sat down and wept, and I mourned for days. And I was fasting and praying before the face of the God of heaven.
\p
\v 5 And I said, “Ah! Yahweh, the God of heaven, the great and fearsome God, who keeps the covenant and covenant faithfulness to those who love him and to those who keep his commandments:
\v 6 Please let your ear be attentive and your eyes opened to listen to the prayer of your servant that I am praying before your face today, day and night, on account of the sons of Israel, your servants. And I am confessing on account of the sins of the sons of Israel that we have sinned against you. Even I and the house of my father, we have sinned.
\v 7 With extreme corruption we have acted corruptly against you. And we have not kept the commandments, and the statutes, and the judgments that you commanded Moses your servant.
\p
\v 8 Please remember the word that you commanded Moses your servant, saying, ‘If you yourselves act unfaithfully, I myself will scatter you among the peoples.
\v 9 But if you return to me and keep my commandments and do them, although your banished ones are at the extremity of heaven, from there I will gather them and bring them to the place where I have chosen to cause my name to dwell there.’
\p
\v 10 And they are your servants and your people, whom you redeemed by your great power and by your strong hand.
\v 11 Ah! My Lord, please let your ear be attentive to the prayer of your servant and to the prayer of your servants, the ones who delight to fear your name. And please cause your servant to succeed today, and give him mercies before the face of this man.” Now as for me, I was a cupbearer for the king.

\c 2
\p
\v 1 And it happened that, in the month of Nisan, in year 20 of Artaxerxes the king, wine was before his face. And I lifted the wine, and I gave it to the king, and I was not unpleasant before his face.
\p
\v 2 And the king said to me, “Why is your face unpleasant? Now as for you, you are not sick. This is nothing except unpleasantness of heart.” And I was extremely much afraid.
\p
\v 3 And I said to the king, “May the king live to eternity! Why should not my face be unpleasant, when the city, the house of the graves of my fathers, is desolate, and its gates have been consumed by fire.”
\p
\v 4 And the king said to me, “For what is this you are seeking?” And I prayed to the God of heaven.
\p
\v 5 And I said to the king, “If it is good to the king, and if your servant is good before your face, that you would send me to Judah, to the city of the graves of my fathers, and I will build it.”
\p
\v 6 And the king said to me, with the queen sitting beside him, “Until when will be your journey? And when will you return?” And it was good before the face of the king, and he sent me, and I gave to him a time.
\p
\v 7 And I said to the king, “If it is good to the king, let letters be given to me for the governors of Beyond-the-River, that they will bring me across as far as where I enter into Judah;
\v 8 and a letter to Asaph, the keeper of the forest that belongs to the king, that he will give to me timbers to lay the beams of the gates of the citadel, which is for the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house into which I will enter.”
\p
And the king gave to me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.
\v 9 And I came to the governors of Beyond-the-River, and I gave to them the letters of the king. And the king sent with me officers of the army and horsemen.
\p
\v 10 And Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah, the servant, the Ammonite, heard. And it was evil to them, a great evil, that someone had come to seek good for the sons of Israel.
\v 11 And I came to Jerusalem, and I was there three days.
\p
\v 12 And I arose in the night, myself and a few men with me, and I did not tell anyone what my God had been giving to my heart to do for Jerusalem. Now there was no animal with me except the animal upon which I was riding.
\v 13 And I went out at the gate of the valley at night, even to the face of the spring of the dragon, and to the gate of dung. And I was looking intently at the walls of Jerusalem, seeing that they were broken down, and its gates had been consumed by fire.\f + \fq they were broken down \ft or perhaps \fqa the broken-down places \ft (Hebrew Ketiv).\f*
\v 14 And I crossed to the gate of the spring and to the pool of the king, but there was no place for the animal under me to pass.
\v 15 And I was going up by the wadi at night, and I was looking intently at the wall. And I turned back, and I came in at the gate of the valley, and I returned.
\p
\v 16 Now the prefects did not know where I had gone or what I was doing. And until this time I had not yet told the Jews, or the priests, or the nobles, or the prefects, or the rest of the doers of the work.
\p
\v 17 And I said to them, “You see the evil that we are in, that Jerusalem is desolate and its gates have been burned by fire. Come, and let us build the wall of Jerusalem, and we will no longer be a reproach.”
\v 18 And I declared to them the hand of my God, that it was good upon me, and also the words of the king that he had spoken to me.
\p
And they said, “We will rise up and build.” And they strengthened their hands for good.
\p
\v 19 And Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah, the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian heard, and they mocked us, and they despised us. And they said, “What is this thing that you are doing? Are you rebelling against the king?”
\p
\v 20 And I returned them a word, and I said to them: “The God of heaven, he will cause us to succeed, and we ourselves, his servants, will rise up and build. But for you there is neither share nor right nor memorial in Jerusalem.”

\p
\v 1 And it happened that, when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, it burned him, and he was very angry. And he mocked at the Jews.
\p
\v 2 And he spoke before the face of his brothers and the army of Samaria, and he said, “What are the feeble Jews doing? Will they restore for themselves? Will they sacrifice? Will they finish in a day? Will they bring to life the stones from piles of dust, when they have been burned?”
\p
\v 3 And Tobiah the Ammonite was beside him. And he said, “Yes, if a fox goes up on what they are building, then he would break down their wall of stones!”
\p
\v 4 Hear, our God, that we are a contempt, and cause their taunts to return on their heads! And give them for plunder in a land of captivity.
\v 5 And do not cover over their iniquity, and do not wipe out their sin from before your face, for they have provoked anger before the front of the builders.
\p
\v 6 So we built the wall, and all the wall was joined together up to half of it. And the heart of the people was for working.
\p
\v 7 And it happened that, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the health of the walls of Jerusalem was going up and the breaks were beginning to be closed, it burned them extremely.
\v 8 And all of them together conspired to come to fight against Jerusalem and to make confusion for it.
\v 9 And we prayed to our God. And we set up a guard on account of them, by day and by night against their faces.
\p
\v 10 And Judah said,
\q1 “The strength of the burden-bearers is failing, and there is much rubble.
\q2 And as for us, we are not able to build the wall.”
\m
\v 11 And our adversaries said, “They will not know, and they will not see until when we come into their midst and kill them. And we will cause the work to stop.”
\p
\v 12 And it happened that, when the Jews dwelling beside them came, they said to us ten times, “From all the places where you turn, they are on us!”\f + \fq From all the places where you turn, they are on us \ft meaning of Hebrew uncertain\f*
\p
\v 13 And I stationed from the lowest of places behind the wall, in the bare places; and I stationed the people by families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.
\v 14 And I looked, and I rose up, and I said to the nobles, and to the prefects, and to the rest of the people, “Do not be afraid of their faces. Remember my great and fearsome Lord! And fight for your brothers, your sons and your daughters, your wives and your houses.”
\p
\v 15 And it happened that, when our enemies heard that it was known to us, and God had frustrated their counsels, all of us returned to the wall, a man to his work.
\v 16 And it happened that, from that day, half of my young men were doing the work, and half of them were grasping, even the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the breastplates. And the officials were behind all the house of Judah.
\v 17 Those who were building the wall, and those who were carrying burdens, the loaders, they were doing the work with one of his hands and one grasping weaponry.
\v 18 And the builders: a man girded his sword to his loins and built. And the one who blew the ram’s horn was beside me.
\p
\v 19 And I said to the nobles and to the prefects and to the rest of the people, “The work is great and vast, and we are separated on the wall, a man far from his brother.
\v 20 At the place where you hear the sound of the ram’s horn, you shall gather to us there. Our God will fight for us.”
\p
\v 21 So we were doing the work. And half of them were grasping spears from the rising of the dawn until the coming out of the stars.
\v 22 Also, at that time I said to the people, “Let a man and his young man lodge the night in the midst of Jerusalem, and they will be for us by night a guard and by day a worker.”
\v 23 And neither I, nor my brothers, nor my young men, nor the men of the guard who were behind me, none of us stripped off our clothes, or a man his weapon at the water.\f + \fq or a man his weapon at the water \ft meaning of Hebrew uncertain\f*

\c 5
\p
\v 1 And there was a great outcry of the people and their wives against their brothers, the Jews.
\p
\v 2 And there were those who said, “Our sons and our daughters, we are many. And let us take grain, so we can eat, and we can live.”
\p
\v 3 And there were those who said, “We are mortgaging our fields and our vineyards and our houses so we can get grain during the famine.”
\p
\v 4 And there were those who said, “We have borrowed silver for the tribute of the king on our fields and our vineyards.
\v 5 And now, our flesh is as the flesh of our brothers, our sons are as their sons. And behold, we are putting our sons and our daughters into bondage as slaves. There are those even of our daughters who have been put into bondage, and there is nothing to God in our hand, for our fields and our vineyards belong to others.”
\p
\v 6 And it burned me extremely when I heard their outcry and these words.
\v 7 And my heart reigned over me, and I contended with the nobles and with the prefects. And I said to them, “You are lending interest, a man against his brother!” And I put forth a great assembly against them.
\p
\v 8 And I said to them, “We ourselves, according to our ability, have bought back our brothers, the Jews, the ones who were sold to the nations. But even you yourselves are selling your brothers, and they are being bought back by us!” Then they were silent, and they did not find a word.
\p
\v 9 And I said, “This thing that you are doing is not good. Should you not walk in the fear of our God, because of the reproach of the nations, our enemies?\f + \fq And I said \ft or perhaps \fqa And he said \ft (Hebrew Ketiv).\f*
\v 10 Also, even I, my brothers, and my young men are lending against them silver and grain. Please, let us forsake this interest!
\v 11 Please, even today, return to them their fields, their vineyards, their olive orchards, and their houses, and a hundred of the silver and the grain, the new wine, and the oil that you are lending against them.”
\p
\v 12 And they said, “We will return, and we will seek nothing from them. Thus we will do according to what you say.” And I called the priests, and I caused them to swear to do according to this word.
\p
\v 13 Also, I shook out my bosom, and I said, “Thus may God shake out from his house and from his labor every man who does not cause this word to stand. And thus may he be shaken out and emptied.”
\p
And all the assembly said, “Amen!” And they praised Yahweh, and the people did according to this word.
\p
\v 14 Also, from the day that he appointed me to be their governor in the land of Judah, from year 20 even until year 32 of Artaxerxes the king, twelve years, I myself did not eat the bread of the governor, nor did my brothers.
\v 15 But the former governors who were before my face had been heavy on the people, and they took from them bread and wine, after forty silver shekels. Also, their young men had acted dominantly over the people. But I myself did not do thus, from the face of the fear of God.
\v 16 Yes, also I held fast to the work of this wall, and we did not buy a field. And all my young men were gathered there for the work.
\p
\v 17 Now the Jews and the prefects were 150 men at my table, with the ones coming to us from the nations that were around us.
\v 18 And what was made for one day was one bull, six choice sheep, and birds were made for me, and between ten days all kinds of wine in abundance. So with this I did not seek the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy on this people.
\p
\v 19 Remember me, my God, for good, all that I have done for this people.

\c 6
\p
\v 1 And it happened, when it was heard by Sanballat and Tobiah, and by Geshem the Arabian, and by the rest of our enemies, that I had built the wall and a break was not remaining in it (although until that time I had not set up the doors in the gates),
\v 2 that Sanballat and Geshem sent to me, saying, “Come, and let us appoint a time to meet together among the villages in the valley of Ono.” And they were thinking to do evil to me.
\p
\v 3 And I sent messengers to them, saying, “I am doing a great work, and I am not able to go down. Why should the work stop while I abandon it and go down to you?”
\p
\v 4 And they sent to me according to this word four times, and I turned them back according to this word.
\p
\v 5 Then Sanballat sent his young man to me a fifth time according to this word, and an opened letter was in his hand.
\v 6 In it was written, “It is heard among the nations, and Gashmu is saying, that you and the Jews are thinking to rebel, therefore you are building the wall. And you are becoming a king over them, according to these words.
\v 7 And also, you have set up prophets to call out concerning you in Jerusalem, saying, ‘A king is in Judah!’ And now, it will be heard by the king according to these words. So now, come, and let us consult together.”
\p
\v 8 And I sent to him, saying, “No such thing has been done according to these words that you are saying, but you are inventing them out of your own heart.”
\p
\v 9 For all of them were frightening us, saying, “Their hands will drop from the work, and it will not be done.” So now, strengthen my hands.
\p
\v 10 Now as for me, I entered the house of Shemaiah, the son of Delaiah, the son of Mehetabel, and he was confined. And he said, “Let us appoint a time to meet in the house of God, in the midst of the temple. And let us shut the doors of the temple, for they are coming to kill you. Yes, at night they are coming to kill you.”
\p
\v 11 And I said, “Should a man such as I run away? And who, such as I, is it that could go in to the temple and live? I will not go in!”
\p
\v 12 And I recognized, and behold, God had not sent him. But he spoke the prophecy against me, for Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.
\v 13 For this purpose he was hired, so that I would be afraid, and I would do thus and sin. And it might become an evil name to them, so that they could reproach me.
\p
\v 14 My God, remember Tobiah, and Sanballat according to these deeds of his, and also Noadiah the prophetess, and the rest of the prophets who are frightening me.
\p
\v 15 And the wall was finished on 25 of Elul, on day 52.
\v 16 And it happened that, when all our enemies heard, all the nations that were around us were afraid, and they fell extremely in their eyes. And they knew that this work was done by our God.
\v 17 Also, in those days, the nobles of Judah were multiplying their letters going to Tobiah, and those belonging to Tobiah were coming to them.
\v 18 For many in Judah were masters of oath to him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah. And Jehohanan his son had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah.
\v 19 Also, they were saying his good deeds before my face, and they were taking out my words to him. Tobiah sent letters to frighten me.


\c 7
\p
\v 1 And it happened that, when the wall was built and I had set up the doors, the gatekeepers and the ones who sang and the Levites were appointed.
\v 2 And I gave Hanani, my brother, and Hananiah, the official for the citadel, charge over Jerusalem. For he was according to a faithful man, and he feared God more than many.
\p
\v 3 And I said to them, “Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun becomes hot. And while they are still standing, let them shut the doors, and they must bar them. And set up watches for those who dwell in Jerusalem, a man in his watch, and a man in front of his house.”
\p
\v 4 Now the city was wide on two hands and great, and the people were few in the midst of it. And there were no built houses.
\v 5 And my God gave to my heart, and I gathered together the nobles and the prefects and the people to be enrolled by genealogy. And I found the book of the genealogy for the ones who came up at the first.
\p
And I found written in it:
\p
\v 6 “These are the sons of the province, the ones who went up from the captivity of the exiles, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon exiled. And they returned to Jerusalem and to Judah, a man to his city,

\v 62 The sons of Delaiah, the sons of Tobiah, the sons of Nekoda, were 642.
\p
\v 63 And from the priests: the sons of Habaiah; the sons of Hakkoz; the sons of Barzillai, who took a wife from the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and he was called by their name.
\p
\v 64 These ones sought their record among the ones who were enrolled by genealogy, but it was not found. And they were desecrated from the priesthood.
\v 65 And the Tirshatha said to them that they must not eat from the holiest holy food until the priest stood with Urim and Thummim.
\p
\v 66 All the assembly, as one, was 42, 360:

\v 72 And what the remnant of the people gave was 20, 000 gold darics, and 2, 000 silver minas, and 67 tunics of priests.”
\b
\p
\v 73 And the priests, and the Levites, and the gatekeepers, and the ones who sang, and some from the people, and the Nethinim, and all Israel dwelt in their cities. And the seventh month came, and the sons of Israel were in their cities.

\c 8
\p
\v 1 And all the people gathered as one man to the open area that is before the face of the gate of water. And they said to Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which Yahweh had commanded Israel.
\v 2 And Ezra the priest brought the law before the face of the assembly of both men and women and all who were understanding to hear, on day one of the seventh month.
\v 3 And he read it aloud before the face of the open area that is before the face of the gate of water, from the light until the middle of the day, in front of the men and the women, and the ones who were understanding. And the ears of all the people listened to the book of the law.
\v 4 And Ezra the scribe stood on a platform of wood that they had made for the purpose. And beside him stood: Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Uriah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and from his left, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malkijah, and Hashum, and Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, Meshullam.
\v 5 And Ezra opened the book before the eyes of all the people, for he was higher than all the people. And as soon as he opened it, all the people stood.
\p
\v 6 And Ezra blessed Yahweh the great God. And all the people answered, “Amen! Amen!” with their hands uplifted. And they knelt and prostrated themselves to Yahweh, nostrils to the ground.
\v 7 And Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites were causing the people to understand the law. And the people were in their place.
\v 8 And they read aloud carefully from the book, from the law of God, and set the interpretation. And they understood the reading.\f + \fq and set the interpretation \ft meaning of Hebrew uncertain\f*
\p
\v 9 And Nehemiah, who was the Tirshatha, and Ezra, the priest, the scribe, and the Levites who were causing the people to understand, said to all the people: “Today is holy; it belongs to Yahweh your God. Do not mourn and do not weep.” For all the people were weeping after they heard the words of the law.
\p
\v 10 And he said to them, “Go, eat the fat and drink the sweet, and send portions to those for whom nothing is prepared, for today is holy, belonging to our Lord. And do not grieve, for, the joy of Yahweh, it is your strength.”
\p
\v 11 And the Levites caused all the people to be silent, saying, “Hush, for today is holy. And do not grieve.”
\p
\v 12 And all the people went to eat and to drink and to send away portions and to make a great rejoicing, for they understood the words that had been made known to them.
\p
\v 13 And on the second day, the heads of the fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites were gathered to Ezra the scribe, even to give attention to the words of the law.
\v 14 And they found written in the law that Yahweh commanded by the hand of Moses: that the sons of Israel should live in huts during the feast in the seventh month;
\v 15 and that they should cause others to hear and cause a sound to pass throughout all their cities and in Jerusalem, saying, “Go out to the mountain, and bring branches of olive, and branches of oil trees, and branches of myrtle, and branches of palms, and branches of leafy trees, to make huts, as it is written.”
\p
\v 16 And the people went out and brought and made huts for themselves, a man on his roof, and in their courtyards, and in the courtyards of the house of God, and in the open area of the gate of water, and in the open area of the gate of Ephraim.
\v 17 And all the assembly, the ones who returned from the captivity, made huts, and they dwelt in the huts. For the sons of Israel had not done thus from the days of Joshua the son of Nun until that day. And there was extremely great rejoicing.
\v 18 And he read aloud from the book of the law of God, day by day, from the first day to the last day. And they made a seven-days feast, and on the eighth day an assembly, according to the ordinance.


\c 9
\p
\v 1 And on day 24 of this month the sons of Israel were gathered in fasting and in sackcloth, and dust was upon them.
\v 2 And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all the sons of a foreigner. And they stood, and they confessed concerning their sins and the iniquities of their fathers.
\v 3 And they rose up in their place, and they read aloud the book of the law of Yahweh their God a fourth of the day, and a fourth of the day were confessing and prostrating themselves to Yahweh their God.
\p
\v 4 And Jeshua rose up on the stairs of the Levites, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, Kenani. And they cried out with a loud voice to Yahweh their God.
\v 5 And the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, Pethahiah, said:
\p
“Rise up! Bless Yahweh your God from eternity to eternity! And may they bless your glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise.
\v 6 You alone are he, Yahweh: you yourself made the heavens, the heavens of the heavens and all their host, the earth and all that is on it, the seas and all that is in them; and you cause all of them to live; and the host of the heavens prostrates themselves to you.\f + \fq the heavens of the heavens \ft meaning of Hebrew uncertain\f*\f + \fq all their host \ft meaning of Hebrew uncertain\f*
\p
\v 7 You are he, Yahweh, the God who chose Abram. Also, you brought him out from Ur of the Chaldees. Also, you made his name ‘Abraham.’
\v 8 Also, you found his heart faithful before your face: and cut with him the covenant, to give the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites, and the Girgashites, to give to his seed; and you have caused your words to stand, for you are righteous.
\p
\v 9 And you saw the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and you heard their cry at the sea of reeds.
\v 10 And you gave signs and wonders to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all the people of his land, because you knew that they were acting presumptuously toward them. And you made for yourself a name, as it is this day.
\v 11 And you split open the sea before their face, and they passed through the midst of the sea on the dry land. And you cast their pursuers into the depths, like a stone in mighty waters.
\v 12 And you led them with a pillar of cloud by day, and with a pillar of fire by night to shine for them on the way in which they should go.
\v 13 And you came down on the mountain of Sinai and spoke with them from heaven. And you gave to them just judgments and laws of truth, good statutes and commandments.
\v 14 And you made known to them your holy sabbath. And you charged them with commandments, and statutes, and a law, by the hand of Moses your servant.
\v 15 And you gave to them bread from heaven for their hunger, and you brought out for them water from a rock for their thirst. And you said to them to go in to possess the land that you had raised your hand to give to them.
\p
\v 16 But they and our fathers, they acted presumptuously. And they stiffened their neck and did not listen to your commandments.
\v 17 And they refused to hear, and they did not remember your wonderful deeds that you performed with them. And they stiffened their neck and in their rebellion chose a head in order to return to their servitude. But you are a God of forgiveness, gracious and compassionate, long of nostrils and abounding in covenant faithfulness, and you did not forsake them.
\v 18 Even when they made for themselves a calf image and said, ‘This is your God who brought you up from Egypt,’ and they performed great blasphemies,
\v 19 still you, in your great mercies, did not forsake them in the wilderness. He did not take away the pillar of cloud from over them by day to lead them on the way, nor the pillar of fire by night to shine for them and on the way in which they should go.
\v 20 And you gave your good spirit to give them insight. And you did not withhold your manna from their mouth, and you gave them water for their thirst.
\v 21 And you sustained them forty years in the wilderness; they did not lack. Their clothes did not wear out, and their feet did not swell.
\v 22 And you gave to them kingdoms and peoples, and you allocated to them as far as the corners. And they took possession of the land of Sihon, even the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og, the king of Bashan.
\v 23 And you multiplied their sons like the stars of the heavens. And you brought them to the land that you said to their fathers to enter in order to possess it.
\p
\v 24 And the sons went in and possessed the land, and before their face you subdued the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites. And you gave them into their hands, and their kings, and the peoples of the land, to do with them according to their will.
\v 25 And they captured fortified cities and fat ground. And they possessed houses full of all good things, hewn cisterns, vineyards, and olive orchards, and food trees in abundance. And they ate and were satisfied and grew fat and reveled in your great goodness.
\p
\v 26 And they disobeyed and rebelled against you, and they cast your law behind their back. And they killed your prophets, who testified against them in order to bring them back to you. And they performed great blasphemies.
\v 27 And you gave them into the hand of their adversaries, and they harassed them. And in the time of their distress they cried out to you, and you yourself heard from heaven. And, according to your many mercies, you gave to them saviors, and they saved them from the hand of their adversaries.
\p
\v 28 And after rest belonged to them, they returned to doing evil before your face. And you left them to the hand of their enemies, and they oppressed them. And they returned and cried out to you, and you yourself heard from heaven and delivered them many times according to your mercies.
\v 29 And you testified against them to bring them back to your law. But as for them, they acted presumptuously and did not listen to your commandments. And, concerning your judgments, they sinned against them, which, if a person does, then he will live by them. And they gave a stubborn shoulder, and stiffened their neck, and did not hear.
\p
\v 30 And you continued with them many years, and you testified against them with your spirit by the hand of your prophets, but they did not give an ear. And you gave them into the hand of the peoples of the lands.
\v 31 But, in your many mercies, you did not make a complete end of them, and you did not forsake them. For you are a gracious and merciful God.
\p
\v 32 So now, our God, the great, mighty, and fearsome God, who keeps the covenant and covenant faithfulness, do not let all the hardship be little before your face, that has found us, our kings, our leaders, and our priests, and our prophets, and our fathers, and all your people from the days of the kings of Assyria until this day.
\v 33 And you are righteous concerning all that has come upon us. For you have acted faithfully; but as for us, we have acted wickedly.
\v 34 And our kings, our leaders, our priests, and our fathers have not done your law. And they have not attended to your commandments or to your testimonies that you testified against them.
\v 35 And as for them, they did not serve you in their kingdom, and in your great goodness that you gave to them, and in the wide and fat land that you gave before their face. And they did not turn away from their evil deeds.
\p
\v 36 Behold us today; we are servants. And the land that you gave to our fathers, to eat its fruit and its goodness; behold us, we are servants in it!
\v 37 And its great produce belongs to the kings whom you have given to be over us in our sins, and to be ruling over our bodies and over our livestock, according to their will. And we are in great distress.
\v 38 And in all of this, we are cutting a faithful covenant, and writing even on a sealed document our leaders, our Levites, our priests.”

\p
\v 28 And the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the ones who sing, the Nethinim, and all the ones who were separating themselves from the peoples of the lands to the law of God, their wives, their sons and their daughters, all who were knowing, being able to understand,
\v 29 were clinging to their brothers, their nobles, and were entering into a curse and into an oath: to walk in the law of God, which was given by the hand of Moses the servant of God; and to keep and to do all the commandments of Yahweh our Lord, and his judgments and his statutes;
\v 30 and that we would not give our daughters to the peoples of the land, and we would not take their daughters for our sons;
\v 31 and, on the sabbath or on a holy day, we would not take from the peoples of the land, the ones bringing goods and all kinds of grain to sell on the day of the sabbath; and we would leave alone the seventh year and interest of every hand.
\v 32 Also, we caused to stand for us commandments to give over us a third of a shekel in a year for the service of the house of our God:
\v 33 for the bread in rows and the continual offering, and for the continual burnt offering, the sabbaths, the new moons, for the appointed times, and for the holy things, and for the sin offerings to cover over for Israel, and all the work of the house of our God.
\p
\v 34 And we cast lots among the priests, the Levites, and the people: concerning the offering of pieces of wood, to bring them to the house of our God, for the house of our fathers at the appointed times year by year, for burning on the altar of Yahweh our God as written in the law;
\v 35 and to bring the firstfruits of our soil and the firstfruits of all the fruit of every tree, year by year, to the house of Yahweh;
\v 36 and the firstborns of our sons and our livestock, as written in the law, even the firstborns of our herds and our flocks, to bring them to the house of our God, to the priests, the ones who minister in the house of our God.
\v 37 And we will bring: the first of our dough and our offerings, and the fruit of every tree, wine, and oil, for the priests, to the chambers of the house of our God; and a tithe of our soil for the Levites. And they, the Levites, will be the ones receiving tithes in all the cities of our labor.
\v 38 And a priest who is a son of Aaron will be with the Levites when the Levites receive tithes. And the Levites will bring a tithe of the tithe to the house of our God, to the chambers of the house of the treasury.
\v 39 For the sons of Israel and the sons of Levi shall bring to the chambers the offerings of grain, wine, and oil. And there shall be the vessels for the sanctuary, and the priests, the ones who are ministering, and the gatekeepers, and the ones who sing. And we shall not neglect the house of our God.

\p
\v 1 And the leaders of the people dwelt in Jerusalem. And the rest of the people cast lots to bring one out of ten to dwell in Jerusalem the holy city, and nine hands were in the cities.

\v 34 Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah.
\v 35 And some from the sons of the priests had trumpets: Zechariah, the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph;
\v 36 and his brothers, Shemaiah, and Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel and Judah, Hanani, with the instruments of song of David, the man of God. And Ezra the scribe was before their face.
\v 37 And by the gate of the spring and opposite them, they went up on the stairs of the city of David, at the ascent of the wall on top of the house of David and as far as the gate of water, east.
\v 38 And the second thanksgiving group, the one proceeding to the opposite direction, and I after it, with half of the people on top of the wall, on top of the tower of ovens even as far as the broad wall,
\v 39 and on top of the gate of Ephraim, and above the gate of old, and above the gate of fish and the tower of Hananel and the tower of the hundred, even as far as the gate of sheep: and they stood in the gate of the guard.
\v 40 And the two thanksgiving groups stood at the house of God: also I, and half of the prefects with me;
\v 41 and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, Hananiah, with trumpets;
\v 42 and Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malkijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the ones who sang made themselves heard, with Jezrahiah the overseer.
\v 43 And on that day they sacrificed great sacrifices, and they rejoiced, for God had made them glad with great rejoicing. Yes, even the women and the children rejoiced, so the rejoicing of Jerusalem was heard from far away.
\p
\v 44 And on that day men were appointed over the chambers for the storehouses, for the offerings, for the firstfruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them from the fields of the cities the portions of the law for the priests and for the Levites. For Judah rejoiced over the priests and over the Levites, the ones who were standing.
\v 45 And they kept the service watch of their God and the service watch of purification, also the ones who sang and the gatekeepers, according to the commandment of David and Solomon his son.
\v 46 For in the days of David and Asaph, from ancient time there was a head of the ones who sang, and songs of praise and thanksgiving to God.\f + \fq head \ft or perhaps \fqa heads \ft (Hebrew Qere).\f*
\v 47 And in the days of Zerubbabel and in the days of Nehemiah, all Israel was giving the portions of the ones who sang and the gatekeepers, as a daily matter in its day. And they were consecrating for the Levites, and the Levites were consecrating for the sons of Aaron.


\c 13
\p
\v 1 On that day it was read in the book of Moses, in the ears of the people, and it was found written in it, that no Ammonite or Moabite shall enter into the assembly of God until eternity.
\v 2 For they did not meet the sons of Israel with bread and with water. And he hired Balaam against them to curse them, but our God overturned the curse to a blessing.
\v 3 And it happened that, as soon as they heard the law, they separated all the mixed company from Israel.
\p
\v 4 Now, before the face of this, Eliashib the priest, nearly-related to Tobiah, was being put in the chamber of the house of our God.
\v 5 And he made for him a great chamber, and there previously they were putting offerings: the frankincense; and the vessels; and the tithes of the grain, the wine, and the oil, the commandment for the Levites, and the ones who sang, and the gatekeepers; and the offerings of the priests.
\v 6 And during all this I was not in Jerusalem. For I had gone to the king in year 32 of Artaxerxes, the king of Babylon. And at an end of days I requested leave from the king.
\p
\v 7 And I came to Jerusalem. And I noticed the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah by making for him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.
\v 8 And it was extremely evil to me, and I cast out all the things of the house of Tobiah from the storeroom to the outside.
\v 9 And I spoke, and they purified the chambers. And I returned to there the vessels of the house of God, with the offering and the incense.
\p
\v 10 And I knew that the portions of the Levites had not been given, and the Levites and the ones who sang, who did the work, had fled, a man to his field.
\v 11 And I contended with the prefects, and I said, “Why is the house of God forsaken?” And I gathered them and caused them to stand at their stations.
\v 12 And all Judah brought the tithe of the grain, and the wine, and the oil to the treasuries.
\v 13 And I appointed treasurers over the treasuries: Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah from the Levites; and at their hand was Hanan, the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah. For they were considered faithful, and it was for them to apportion to their brothers.
\p
\v 14 Remember me, my God, concerning this, and do not wipe out my faithful kindness that I have done for the house of my God and for its service watches.
\p
\v 15 In those days I saw in Judah ones treading winepresses on the sabbath, and ones bringing in grain-heaps, and ones loading onto donkeys, yes, even wine, grapes, and figs, and all kinds of loads, and ones bringing to Jerusalem on the day of the sabbath. And I protested on the day of their selling provisions.
\v 16 And the Tyrians who dwelt in it were bringing in fish and all kinds of merchandise and were selling them on the sabbath to the sons of Judah, even in Jerusalem.
\v 17 And I contended with the nobles of Judah. And I said to them, “What is this evil thing that you are doing, and profaning the day of the sabbath?
\v 18 Did not your fathers do thus, and our God brought all this evil on us and on this city? And you are increasing wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.”
\p
\v 19 And it happened that, when the gates of Jerusalem grew dark before the face of the sabbath, I spoke, and the doors were shut, and I said that they should not open them until after the sabbath. And I caused some from my young men to stand at the gates; a load could not enter on the day of the sabbath.
\v 20 And the ones who traded and the ones who sold all kinds of goods to sell lodged outside of Jerusalem a time or two.
\v 21 And I testified against them, and I said to them, “Why are you lodging in front of the wall? If you repeat, I will stretch out a hand on you!” From that time, they did not come on the sabbath.
\p
\v 22 And I said to the Levites that they should purify themselves and come keep the gates to consecrate the day of the sabbath.
\p
Remember me concerning this also, my God, and have pity on me according to the greatness of your covenant faithfulness.
\p
\v 23 In those days I also saw Jews who had given a dwelling to Ashdodite, Ammonite, and Moabite women.
\v 24 And their sons, half were speaking Ashdodite, and none of them were knowing to speak Hebrew, but according to the tongue of people group by people group.
\v 25 And I contended with them, and cursed them, and struck some of their men, and pulled out their hair. And I caused them to swear an oath by God: “If you give your daughters to their sons, or if you lift from their daughters for your sons, or for yourselves!
\v 26 Did not Solomon, the king of Israel, sin concerning these things? Yet among many nations there was no king like him: and he was beloved by his God, and God gave him as king over all Israel. The foreign women caused even him to sin.
\v 27 Should we then listen to you, to do all this great evil, to act unfaithfully toward our God and give a dwelling to foreign women?”\f + \fq Should we then listen to you \ft or perhaps \fqa Will it then be heard of you\f*
\p
\v 28 And one from the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite. And I caused him to flee from beside me.
\p
\v 29 Remember them, my God, on account of the defiling of the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites.
\p
\v 30 And I purified them from everything foreign. And I caused the service watches to stand: for the priests and for the Levites, a man in his work;
\v 31 and for the offering of pieces of wood at the appointed times; and for the firstfruits.
\p
Remember me, my God, for good.
