\ts\*

\c 1
\p
\v 1 The vision of Isaiah son of Amoz, which he saw concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, {and} Hezekiah, kings of Judah.

\ts\*
\q1
\v 2 Hear, heavens, and give ear, earth,
\q2 for Yahweh has spoken:
\q1 “Sons I have raised and brought up,
\q2 but they have rebelled against me.

\q1
\v 3 The ox knows his owner,
\q2 and the donkey the feeding trough of his master,
\q1 {but} Israel does not know;
\q2 my people does not understand.”
\b
\ts\*
\q1
\v 4 Woe, sinful nation,
\q2 people heavy of iniquity,
\q1 seed of evildoers,
\q2 sons who act corruptly!
\q1 They have abandoned Yahweh,
\q2 they have despised the Holy One of Israel,
\q2 they have estranged themselves from him.
\b
\ts\*
\q1
\v 5 Why should you still be beaten,
\q2 should you continue {in} rebellion?
\q1 The whole head {is} sick,
\q2 and the whole heart weak.

\q1
\v 6 From the sole of the foot and to the head
\q2 there is no health in it;
\q1 bruises and sores and fresh wounds;
\q2 they have not been pressed out,
\q1 and they have not been bandaged,
\q2 and they have not been softened with oil.
\b
\ts\*
\q1
\v 7 Your land {is} a desolation,
\q2 your cities burned {with} fire;
\q1 your field—in front of you
\q2 strangers are devouring it—
\q2 and {it is} a desolation as the overthrowing of strangers.

\q1
\v 8 And the Daughter of Zion is left
\q2 like a hut in a vineyard,
\q1 like a shed in a cucumber field,
\q2 like a besieged city.

\q1
\v 9 Had not Yahweh of hosts
\q2 left for us a few survivors,
\q1 we would have been like Sodom,
\q2 we would have been like Gomorrah.
\b
\ts\*
\q1
\v 10 Hear the word of Yahweh, rulers of Sodom;
\q2 give ear to the law of our God, people of Gomorrah:
\q1
\v 11 “What {is} the multitude of your sacrifices to me?”
\q2 says Yahweh.
\q1 “I have had enough of the burnt offerings of rams,
\q2 and the fat of fatted beasts,
\q1 and in the blood of bulls or lambs or goats
\q2 I do not delight.

\q1
\v 12 When you come to appear {before} my face,
\q2 who has required this from your hand,
\q2 to trample my courts?
\q1
\v 13 Do not continue to bring an offering of worthlessness;!
\q2 It is incense of abomination to me.
\q1 New moon and Sabbath, calling of assemblies—
\q2 I am not able {to bear} iniquity and festive assembly.

\q1
\v 14 Your new moons and your appointed feasts
\q2 my spirit hates;
\q1 they have become a burden to me.
\q2 I am weary of carrying.

\q1
\v 15 So when you spread out your hands,
\q2 I hide my eyes from you;
\q1 even though you multiply prayer,
\q2 I do not listen;
\q2 your hands are full of blood.
\b
\ts\*
\q1
\v 16 Wash, cleanse yourselves;
\q2
remove the evil of your deeds from before my eyes;
\q2
stop doing evil;
\q1
\v 17 learn to do good;
\q2
seek justice;
\q1
correct the oppressor;
\q2
carry out justice {for} the fatherless;
\q2
contend {for} the widow.”
\b
\ts\*
\q1
\v 18 “Come, now, and let us come to terms,”
\q2
says Yahweh.

\q1
“Though your sins are like scarlet,
\q2
they will be white like snow;

\q1
though they are red like crimson,
\q2
they will be like wool.

\q1
\v 19 If you agree and obey,
\q2
you will eat the good of the land,

\q1
\v 20 but if you refuse and rebel,
\q2
{by} the sword you will be eaten,”
\q2
for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken.
\b
\ts\*
\q1
\v 21 How the faithful city
\q2
has become a prostitute!

\q1
She who was full of justice—
\q2
righteousness lodged in her,
\q2
but now, murderers.

\q1
\v 22 Your silver has become dross,
\q2
your wine mixed with water.

\q1
\v 23 Your princes {are} rebels
\q2
and companions of thieves;

\q1
everyone loves bribes
\q2
and pursues payoffs.

\q1
They do not defend the fatherless,
\q2
and the cause of the widow does not come to them.
\b
\ts\*
\q1
\v 24 Thus {is} the declaration of the Lord Yahweh of hosts, the Mighty One of Israel:
\q2
“Woe! I shall gratify myself before my adversaries,
\q2
and avenge myself before my enemies;
\q1
\v 25 and turn my hand against you,
\q2
and refine your dross as {with} lye,
\q2
and take away all your impurity.

\q1
\v 26 And I shall restore your judges as at the first,
\q2
and your counselors as at the beginning;
\q1
 afterwards you will be called The City of Righteousness,
\q2
a faithful town.”
\b
\ts\*
\q1
\v 27 Zion will be redeemed by justice,
\q2
and her repentant ones by righteousness,
\q1
\v 28 but rebels and sinners {will be} crushed together,
\q2
and those who abandon Yahweh will come to an end,
\b
\ts\*
\q1
\v 29 For they will be ashamed of the sacred oak trees
\q2
which you desired,
\q2
and you will be embarrassed by the gardens that you have chosen.
\q1
\v 30 For you will be like an oak
\q2
whose leaf fades,
\q2
and like a garden that has no water.

\q1
\v 31 And the strong man will be like tinder,
\q2
and his work like a spark,

\q1
and both of them will burn together,
\q2
and none will quench {them}.
\ts\*

\c 2
\p
\v 1 The word that Isaiah son of Amoz perceived, concerning Judah and Jerusalem:
\p
\v 2 And it will be in the last days,
\q1
the mountain of the house of Yahweh
\q2 will be established as the head of the mountains,
\q1 and it will be raised up above the hills,
\q2
and all the nations will flow to it.

\m
\v 3 And many peoples will come and say,
\q1
“Come, and let us go up to the mountain of Yahweh,
\q2
to the house of the God of Jacob,

\q1
so he may teach us from his ways,
\q2
and we may walk in his paths.”

\q1
For from Zion will go the law,
\q2
and the word of Yahweh from Jerusalem.

\q1
\v 4 And he will judge between the nations,
\q2 and will render decisions for many peoples,
\q1 and they will hammer their swords into plowshares,
\q2 and their spears into pruning hooks;

\q1 nation will not lift up sword against nation,
\q2 and they will not learn war again.
\b
\ts\*
\q1
\v 5 House of Jacob,
\q2
come and let us walk in the light of Yahweh.
\b
\ts\*
\q1
\v 6 For you have abandoned your people,
\q2
O house of Jacob,

\q1 For they are filled with eastern things
\q2
and they practice divination like the Philistines,
\q2
and they shake hands with sons of foreigners.

\q1
\v 7 And its land is full of silver and gold,
\q2
and there is no limit to its wealth;

\q2 its land also is full of horses,
\q2
and there is no limit to its chariots,
\q1
\v 8 And its land is full of idols;
\q2
they worship the craftsmanship of its hands,
\q2
what its fingers have made.

\q1
\v 9 And a person will be bowed down,
\q2
and a man will fall down,
\q2
but do not raise them up!
\b
\ts\*
\q1
\v 10 Go into the rock
\q2
and hide in the ground
\q2 from the face of the terror of Yahweh
\q2
and from the glory of his majesty.

\q1
\v 11 The lofty eyes of man will be brought low,
\q2
and the pride of men brought down,
\q1 and Yahweh alone will be exalted on that day.

\q1
\v 12 For the day of Yahweh of hosts
\q2
{is} against everyone who is proud and raised up
\q2
and against every arrogant one—and he will be {brought} down—
\q1
\v 13 and against all the cedars of Lebanon,
\q2
high and lifted up,
\q2
and against all the oaks of Bashan

\q1
\v 14 and against all the high mountains
\q2
and against all the elevated hills
\q1
\v 15 and against every high tower
\q2
and against every fortified wall
\q1
\v 16 and against all the ships of Tarshish
\q2
and against all beautiful sailing vessels.

\q1
\v 17 And the pride of man will be brought low,
\q2
and the haughtiness of men will fall,
\q1 and Yahweh alone will be exalted on that day.
\q1
\v 18 And the idols will completely pass away.
\b
\ts\*
\q1
\v 19 And {men} will go into the caves of the rocks
\q2
and the holes of the ground,
\q1 from the face of the terror of Yahweh,
\q2
and from the glory of his majesty,
\q2
when he rises to awe the earth.

\q1
\v 20 On that day, man will throw away
\q2
his idols of silver and his idols of gold
\q1
which they made for himself to worship,
\q2
to diggers of holes and bats,
\q1
\v 21 going into the crevices of the rocks
\q2
and into the clefts of the ragged rocks,
\q1
from the face of the terror of Yahweh
\q2
and from the glory of his majesty,
\q2
when he rises to awe the earth.
\b
\ts\*
\q1
\v 22 Stop yourselves from {regarding} man,
\q2
whose breath {is} in his nose,
\q2
for what is he regarded as?

\ts\*

\c 3
\q1
\v 1 For behold the Lord Yahweh of hosts will take away from Jerusalem and from Judah
\q1 supply and support:
\q2 all the supply of bread
\q2 and all the supply of water,

\q1
\v 2 the mighty one and the man of war,
\q2 the judge and the prophet
\q2 and the diviner and the elder,
\q1
\v 3 the captain of fifty
\q2 and the exalted of face
\q1 and the counselor and the expert craftsman
\q2 and the skillful enchanter.
\b
\ts\*
\q1
\v 4 “And I shall place youths {as} their leaders,
\q2 and infants will rule over them.

\q1
\v 5 And the people will be oppressed,
\q2 a man by a man,
\q2 and a man by his neighbor;
\q1 the lad will insult the elderly,
\q2 and the dishonorable against the honorable.

\q1
\v 6 For a man will seize his brother
\q2 in the house of his father:
\q1 ‘You have a coat;
\q2 be our ruler,
\q1 and this ruin
\q2 {will be} under your hand.’
\q1
\v 7 On that day he will lift up, saying,
\q1 ‘I shall not be a healer,
\q2 and in my house there is no bread and there is no clothing.
\q1 You shall not appoint me
\q2 ruler of the people.’”
\b
\ts\*
\q1
\v 8 For Jerusalem has stumbled,
\q2 and Judah has fallen,
\q1 because their tongue and their deeds {are} against Yahweh,
\q2 defying the eyes of his glory.
\q1
\v 9 The appearance of their faces witnesses against them,
\q2 and they tell of their sin like Sodom;
\q2 they do not hide {it}.
\q1 Woe to their life!
\q2 For they have completed for themselves affliction.
\b
\ts\*
\q1
\v 10 Tell the righteous that {it will be} well,
\q2 for they will eat the fruit of their deeds.
\q1
\v 11 Woe to the wicked! {It will be} calamity,
\q2 for the recompense of his hands will be done to him.
\b
\ts\*
\q1
\v 12 My people—children {are} their oppressors,
\q2 and women rule over it.
\q1 My people, those who guide you lead astray
\q2 and consume the direction of your path.
\b
\ts\*
\q1
\v 13 Yahweh is positioned to contend
\q2 and is standing to judge the peoples.
\q1
\v 14 Yahweh will come with judgment
\q2 with the elders of his people and their leaders:
\q1 “And you, you have consumed the vineyard;
\q2 the plunder of the poor {is} in your houses.
\q1
\v 15 Why do you crush my people
\q2 and grind the faces of the poor?”
\q1 —the declaration of the Lord Yahweh of hosts.
\b
\ts\*
\q1
\v 16 And Yahweh said:
\q1 “Because the daughters of Zion are proud,
\q2 and they walk extending the neck,
\q2 and {with} flirting eyes,
\q1 walking and mincing their steps,
\q2 and tinkling their feet.
\q
\v 17 Then the Lord shall scrape
\q2 the heads of the daughters of Zion,
\q2 and Yahweh shall make their private parts naked.”
\b
\ts\*
\q1
\v 18 On that day the Lord will remove
\q2 the finery of the anklets and the headbands
\q2 and the crescent ornaments,

\q2
\v 19 the earrings and the bracelets and the veils,
\q1
\v 20 the headdresses and the anklets
\q2 and the sashes and the boxes of perfume and the amulets,

\q1
\v 21 the rings and the rings of the nose,
\q2
\v 22 the festive garments and the mantles and the cloaks and the purses,
\q1
\v 23 and the fine garments and the undergarments,
\q2 and the turbans and the shawls.
\b
\ts\*
\q1
\v 24 “And it will happen, instead of fragrance will be stench;
\q2 and instead of a sash, a rope;
\q1 and instead of styled hair, baldness;
\q2 and instead of a fine robe, a robe of sackcloth;
\q2 branding instead of beauty.
\q1
\v 25 Your men will fall by the sword,
\q2 and your strong men in war.
\q1
\v 26 And her gates will lament and mourn,
\q2 and she will be alone, sitting on the ground.


\ts\*

\c 4
\q1
\v 1 And seven women will take hold of
\q2 one man on that day, saying,
\q1 ‘Our food we shall eat
\q2 and our clothing we shall wear.
\q1 Only, call us your name;
\q2 remove our shame.’
\q1
\v 2 On that day the branch of Yahweh will be
\q2 beauty and glory,
\q1 and the fruit of the land
\q2 excellent and delightful
\q2 for the remnant of Israel.”
\b
\ts\*
\q1
\v 3 And the remainder in Zion
\q2 and the leftover in Jerusalem⁠—
\q1 "Holy" will be said of him,
\q2 everyone who is written for life in Jerusalem.
\q1
\v 4 Surely the Lord will wash away the filth of the daughters of Zion,
\q2 and cleanse the blood stains of Jerusalem from her midst,
\q2 by the spirit of judgment and the spirit of fire.
\b
\ts\*
\q1
\v 5 Then over all the sanctuary of Mount Zion
\q2 and over her assembly Yahweh will create
\q2 cloud by day and smoke
\q2 and the shining of a flaming fire by night
\q2 for a canopy over all the glory,
\q1
\v 6 and it will be a shelter for shade by day from the heat
\q2 and a refuge and a cover from the storm and rain.


\ts\*

\c 5
\q1
\v 1 Let me sing, please, to my beloved
\q2 a song of my beloved for his vineyard.
\q1 My beloved had a vineyard
\q2 on a hill of richness.
\q1
\v 2 And he dug it and cleared it
\q2 and planted it {with} choice vines,
\q1 and he built a tower in the middle of it
\q2 and also hewed a winepress in it.
\q1 And he waited for {it} to produce grapes,
\q2 but it produced wild grapes.
\b
\ts\*
\q1
\v 3 And now, dweller of Jerusalem
\q2 and man of Judah,
\q1 judge, please, between me and between my vineyard.
\q1
\v 4 What more could have been done for my vineyard,
\q2 that I have not done for it?
\q1 I waited for {it} to produce grapes⁠,
\q2 but why did it produce wild grapes?

\q1
\v 5 And now, please, I shall tell you
\q2 what I shall do to my vineyard:
\q1 I shall remove its hedge,
\q2 and it will be consumed.
\q1 I shall break down its wall,
\q2 and it will be trampled down.
\q1
\v 6 And I shall make it a desolation.
\q2 It will not be pruned or hoed,
\q2 and briers and thorns will spring up.
\q1 And I shall command the clouds
\q2 against raining rain on it.
\b
\ts\*
\q1
\v 7 For the vineyard of Yahweh of hosts
\q2 {is} the house of Israel,
\q1 and the man of Judah
\q2 his pleasant plant.
\q1 And he waited for justice,
\q2 but behold, slaughter;
\q1 for righteousness,
\q2 but behold, screaming.
\b
\ts\*
\q1
\v 8 Woe, those who join house to house,
\q2 field to field they approach
\q1 until {there is} no room,
\q2 and you are made to remain alone
\q2 in the midst of the land!
\m
\v 9 In my ears, Yahweh of hosts:
\q1 ‘Surely many houses will be empty—
\q2 great and good ones without an inhabitant.
\q1
\v 10 For a ten-yoke vineyard will yield one bath,
\q2 and a homer {of} seed will yield an ephah.’
\b
\ts\*
\q1
\v 11 Woe, those who rise up early in the morning \q2 to obtain strong drink,
\q1 those who loiter into the night
\q2 {as} wine inflames them,
\q1
\v 12 and whose feasts are harp and lyre,
\q2 tambourine and flute and wine,
\q1 but they do not regard the work of Yahweh,
\q2 and they have not discerned the doings of his hands.

\q1
\v 13 Therefore, my people are exiled
\q2 for lack of understanding,
\q1 and its honorable people are hungry,
\q2 and its parched multitude is thirsty.
\q1
\v 14 Therefore, Sheol has enlarged its appetite
\q2 and has opened its mouth without limit,
\q1 and its elite and its crowd will descend,
\q2 and its revelers and its happy.

\q1
\v 15 And man will be humbled, and mankind will be brought down,
\q2 and the eyes of the lofty will be brought down.
\q1
\v 16 And Yahweh of hosts will be exalted in justice,
\q2 and the Holy God will be holy by his righteousness.
\q1
\v 17 And the sheep will feed as in their pasture,
\q2 and goats will eat the ruins of the fatted.\f + \ft Some modern versions have \fqa and in the ruins, lambs will graze as foreigners\fqa*.\f*
\b
\ts\*
\q1
\v 18 Woe, those who pull in iniquity with cords of falsehood
\q2 and like {with} cart ropes, sin;
\q1
\v 19 who say, ‘Let him hurry,
\q2 let him hasten his work
\q2 so that we may see,
\q1 and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw near
\q2 and let it come and let us know.’
\b
\ts\*
\q1
\v 20 Woe, those who call evil good
\q2 and good evil,
\q1 who set darkness as light,
\q2 and light as darkness,
\q1 who set bitter as sweet,
\q2 and sweet as bitter!

\b
\ts\*
\q1
\v 21 Woe to those wise in their {own} eyes
\q2 and before their {own} faces, discerning.

\ts\*
\q1
\v 22 Woe, mighty men of wine-drinking,
\q2 and men of strength of liquor-mixing;
\q1
\v 23 who declare righteous the wicked for a bribe
\q2 and take away from the righteous his rights!

\q1
\v 24 Therefore, as the tongue of fire devours stubble
\q2 and the dry grass goes down in flame,
\q1 so their root will rot,
\q2 and their blossom will rise like dust.
\q1 For they have rejected the law of Yahweh of hosts,
\q2 and they have despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.

\q1
\v 25 Therefore, the nose of Yahweh burns against his people,
\q2 and he has reached out his hand against them and has struck them,
\q2 and the mountains tremble,
\q1 and their corpses become like garbage \q2 in the streets.
\b
\ts\*
\q1 In all these things, his nose does not turn away,
\q2 and still his hand is stretched out.
\b
\ts\*
\q1
\v 26 And he will lift up a signal for faraway nations
\q2 and will whistle for him from the end of the earth.
\q1 And behold, quick, swift it will come.

\q2
\v 27 None tires and none stumbles among it;
\q2 he does not slumber and does not sleep.
\q1 And the belts of their loins are not loose,
\q2 and the thongs of their sandals are not broken.
\q1
\v 28 For its arrows {are} sharp
\q2 and all its bows bent;
\q1 the hooves of its horses seem like flint,
\q2 and its chariot wheels like storms.

\q1
\v 29 Its roaring like a lion,
\q2 and it will roar like young lions.
\q1 And it will growl and seize the prey and drag {it} away,
\q2 and there will be no rescuer.
\q1
\v 30 And it will roar against it on that day
\q2 as the roar of the sea.
\q1 And {one} looks over the land,
\q2 and behold, darkness, suffering!
\q1 And the light will be darkened by the clouds.

\c 6
\p
\v 1 In the year of the death of King Uzziah, then I saw the Lord sitting on a throne, high and lifted up, and his hem filled the temple.
\v 2 The seraphim stood above him: six wings—six wings for each; with two covering its face and with two covering its feet, and with two it flew.
\v 3 And each {one} called to another and said,
\q1 “Holy, holy, holy, {is} Yahweh of hosts!
\q2 The whole earth {is} full of his glory.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 4 And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of the one who cried out, and the house was filled with smoke.
\ts\*
\p
\v 5 And I said,
\q1 “Woe to me! For I am doomed because I {am} a man of unclean lips,
\q1 and I live among a people of unclean lips,
\q1 because my eyes have seen the King, Yahweh of hosts!”

\ts\*
\m
\v 6 And one of the seraphim flew to me, and in his hand {was} a hot coal he had taken with the tongs from off the altar.
\v 7 And he caused {it} to touch on my mouth and said,
\q1 “Behold, this has touched on your lips,
\q2 and your guilt has been taken away and your sin atoned for.”

\ts\*
\m
\v 8 And I heard the voice of the Lord say, “Whom shall I send, and who will go for us?”
\ts\*
\p
And I said, “Here I {am}, send me.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 9 And he said, “Go and tell this people,
\q1 ‘Listen closely, but do not understand,
\q2 and see clearly, but do not perceive.’

\q1
\v 10 Fatten the heart of this people,
\q2 and dull its ears and dim its eyes.
\q1 Otherwise it might see with its eyes
\q2 and hear with its ears
\q1 and understand with its heart,
\q2 and turn and be healed.”

\ts\*
\m
\v 11 And I said, “Until when, Lord?”
\ts\*
\p
And he said:
\q1 “Until cities are desolate,
\q2 without inhabitants,
\q1 and the houses {are} without people,
\q2 and the land is a desolate waste,
\q1
\v 12 and Yahweh has driven the people far away,
\q2 and the desertion in the midst of the land is great.

\q1
\v 13 If a tenth {are} still in it,
\q2 then it will turn back and be consumed.
\q1 As an elm or as an oak
\q2 which, in being cut down,
\q2 {has} a stump for it,
\q1 the holy seed {is} its stump.”


\ts\*

\c 7
\p
\v 1 And it happened, in the days of Ahaz son of Jotham son of Uzziah, king of Judah, Rezin the king of Aram, and Pekah son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up {to} Jerusalem to war against it, but they could not prevail against it.
\v 2 And it was reported to the house of David, saying, “Aram stands by with Ephraim,” and his heart trembled, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the forest shake before the face of the wind.

\ts\*
\p
\v 3 And Yahweh said to Isaiah, “Go out, please, to meet Ahaz, you and your son Shear-Jashub, at the end of the channel of the upper pool, to the road of the field of the fuller.
\v 4 And say to him, ‘Be careful and calm, you shall not be afraid, and your heart shall not be soft from these two tails of smoldering firebrands, by the burning nose of Rezin and Aram, and the son of Remaliah.
\v 5 Because Aram, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah have planned evil against you, saying,
\v 6 “Let us go up against Judah and terrify her, and let us break into her and crown a king in her midst, the son of Tabeel.”’

\ts\*
\q1
\v 7 Thus the Lord Yahweh says,
\q2 It will not succeed, and it will not be,
\q1
\v 8 because the head of Aram {is} Damascus,
\q2 and the head of Damascus {is} Rezin.
\q1 And within 65 years,
\q2 Ephraim will be broken from {being} a people.

\v 10 And Yahweh continued to speak to Ahaz, saying,

\v 12 And Ahaz said, “I shall not ask, and I shall not test Yahweh.”

\v 13 And he said, “Listen, please, house of David. Is it too little for you to tire out the people, that you also tire out my God?

\v 16 For before the child knows to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land will be desolate, though you fear the faces of its two kings.
\v 17 Yahweh will bring the king of Assyria on you and on your people, and on the house of your father days that have not come since the day Ephraim turned away from Judah.”

\ts\*
\q1
\v 18 And it will happen on that day,
\q2 Yahweh will whistle for a fly
\q2 that {is} in the distant streams of Egypt,
\q2 and for a bee that {is} in the land of Assyria.
\q1
\v 19 And they will come and settle down, all of them,
\q2 in the valleys of desolation
\q1 and in the clefts of the rocks,
\q2 and in all the thornbushes, and in all the pastures.

\ts\*
\q1
\v 20 At that time the Lord will shave
\q2 with a razor the laborer beyond the river—
\q2 the king of Assyria—
\q1 the head and the hair of the legs,
\q2 and he will also scrape away the beard.
\q1
\v 21 And it will happen on that day,
\q2 a man will keep alive a young cow and two sheep.
\q1
\v 22 And it will happen, because of the abundance of milk produced,
\q2 he will eat curds,
\q1 for everyone left in the land
\q2 will eat curds and honey.

\q1
\v 23 And it will happen on that day,
\q2 {there} will be, {in} every place

\q2 it will be briers and thorns.
\q1
\v 24 One will go there with arrows and with bows,
\q2 because all the land will be briers and thorns.
\q1
\v 25 And all the hills that were cultivated with the hoe,
\q2 you will not go there {for} fear of the briers and thorns,
\q2 and it will be for sending out of cattle and for grazing of sheep.

\v 1 And Yahweh said to me, “Take for yourself a large tablet, and write on it with a chisel, ‘Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz.’
\v 2 And I shall cause faithful witnesses to attest for me, Uriah the priest, and Zechariah son of Jeberekiah.”
\v 3 And I went to the prophetess, and she conceived and bore a son. And Yahweh said to me, “Call his name Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz.
\v 4 For before the child knows to cry, ‘My father,’ and, ‘My mother,’ one will lift away the riches of Damascus and the plunder of Samaria before the face of the king of Assyria.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 5 And Yahweh continued to speak to me again, saying,
\v 6 “Because this people has refused the waters of Shiloah—those going gently—and rejoices {in} Rezin and the son of Remaliah,
\v 7 so therefore, behold: the Lord is bringing up on them the waters of the river, mighty and many—the king of Assyria and all his glory.

\q1 And it will come up over all its channels
\q2 and go over all its banks.

\q1
\v 8 And it will sweep into Judah, flooding and passing on,
\q2 until it touches your neck.

\q1
\v 9 Raise the war cry, peoples, and be terrified.
\q2 And give ear, all you distant of the land:
\q1 gird yourselves for war and be terrified
\q2 gird yourselves for war and be terrified.
\q1
\v 10 Be advised {with} advice, but it will be made useless;
\q2 speak a speech, but it will not stand,
\q2 for God {is} with us.

\ts\*
\m
\v 11 For thus Yahweh spoke to me, with a strong hand, and turned me away from walking in the way of this people, saying,
\q1
\v 12 Do not call a lie anything that this people calls a lie,
\q2 and its fear you will not fear, and do not be terrified.
\q1
\v 13 You shall sanctify Yahweh of hosts alone,
\q2 and he {is} your fear, and he {is} your terror.

\q1
\v 14 And he will become a sanctuary and a stone of striking
\q2 and a rock of stumbling
\q1 for both the houses of Israel,
\q2 a trap and a snare for the inhabitants of Jerusalem.
\q1
\v 15 And many will stumble over them
\q2 and fall and be broken and be ensnared and captured.

\ts\*
\m
\v 16 Bind up the testimony; seal the law for my disciples.
\v 17 And I shall wait for Yahweh, who hides his face from the house of Jacob, and I shall hope in him.
\v 18 Behold, I and the children whom Yahweh has given to me {are} for signs and for wonders in Israel from Yahweh of hosts, who lives on Mount Zion.

\ts\*
\p
\v 19 And when they say to you, “Consult with mediums and with soothsayers, the ones who chirp and mutter,” how can a people not consult with their God, but with the dead on behalf of the living?
\v 20 To the law and to the testimony! If they do not say as this thing, {it is} because they have no dawn,
\v 21 and will pass through it distressed and hungry. And it will happen when they are hungry, then they will become angry and curse their king and their God and turn upward.
\v 22 And they will look at the earth and behold: trouble and darkness, dimness, distress and gloom is scattered.

\ts\*

\c 9
\p
\v 1 For it will not cover over she who is distressed. In an earlier time he humiliated the land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, but later, he will glorify it, the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations.

\q1
\v 2 The people who walked in darkness
\q2 have seen a great light;
\q1 those who have lived in the land of darkness,
\q2 the light has shone on them.

\q1
\v 3 You have multiplied the nation itself;
\q2 you have increased its joy.
\q1 They rejoice before your face
\q2 like the joy at harvest time,
\q1 as they rejoice
\q2 when dividing the plunder.

\q1
\v 4 For the yoke of his burden
\q2 and the staff of his shoulder,
\q1 the rod of his oppressor,
\q2 you have broken as the day of Midian.
\q1
\v 5 For every boot treading loudly
\q2 and the garment rolled in blood
\q2 will be burned, fuel of fire.

\q1
\v 6 For to us a child is born,
\q2 to us a son is given,
\q2 and the rule will be on his shoulder;
\q1 and his name will be called Wonderful Counselor,
\q2 Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.
\q1
\v 7 Of the increase of {his} government and of peace there will be no end,
\q2 on the throne of David, and over his kingdom,
\q1 to establish it and sustain it
\q2 with justice and with righteousness from now and to eternity.
\q1 The zeal of Yahweh of hosts will do this.

\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 8 The Lord sent a word against Jacob,
\q2 and it fell on Israel.
\q1
\v 9 And the people will know, all of it,
\q2 Ephraim and the inhabitants of Samaria,
\q2 in pride and with an arrogant heart, saying,
\q1
\v 10 “The bricks have fallen, but we will rebuild {with} chiseled {stone};
\q2 the sycamores are felled, but we will replace {them with} cedars.”

\q1
\v 11 And Yahweh will raise up against him Rezin, the adversary,
\q2 and will stir up his enemies,
\q1
\v 12 the Arameans on the east, and the Philistines on the west,
\q2 and they will devour Israel with a whole mouth.
\ts\*
\b
\q1 In all these things, his nose does not draw back,

\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 13 And the people will not turn to him who struck it,
\q2 and they will not seek Yahweh of hosts.
\q1
\v 14 And Yahweh will cut off from Israel head and tail,
\q2 palm branch and reed {in} one day.
\q1
\v 15 The elder and the noble of face are the head,
\q2 and the prophet teaching lies is the tail.

\q1
\v 16 And the guides of this people have misled,
\q2 and its guided are swallowed up.
\q1
\v 17 Therefore, the Lord will not rejoice over their young men
\q2 and on their fatherless and widows he will not have compassion ,
\q1 since everyone is godless and an evildoer,
\q2 and every mouth speaks foolish things.
\ts\*
\b
\q1 In all these things, his nose does not draw back,
\q2 and his hand is still stretched out.

\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 18 For wickedness burns like a fire;
\q2 it devours the briers and thorns,
\q1 and it kindles the thickets of the forest,
\q2 and they mount up {in} a rising of smoke.
\q1
\v 19 Through the wrath of Yahweh of hosts the land is scorched,
\q2 and it will happen: the people as fuel of fire;
\q2 a man does not spare his brother.

\q1
\v 20 And they will devour on the right but be hungry,
\q2 and they will eat on the left but not be satisfied.
\q2 {Every} man will eat the flesh of his arm.
\q1
\v 21 Manasseh {to} Ephraim,

\ts\*

\c 10
\q1
\v 1 Woe, lawmakers of useless laws
\q2 and writers writing perverseness.
\q1
\v 2 suppressing the rights of the needy,
\q2 and robbing the justice of the poor of my people,
\q1 {making} widows become plunder,
\q2 and preying {on} the fatherless!

\q1
\v 3 And what will you do for the day of judgment,
\q2 and for the destruction coming from far away?
\q1 To whom will you flee for help,
\q2 and where will you leave your wealth?
\q1
\v 4 Only, they will crouch among the prisoners,

\ts\*
\b
\q1 In all these things, his nose does not turn back,
\q2 and his hand is still stretched out.

\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 5 Woe, Assyria, the club of my nose, and a rod
\q2 is in their hand {for} my fury!
\q1
\v 6 I send him against an arrogant nation
\q2 and against the people of my wrath.
\q1 I order him to plunder the plunder and to prey on the prey,
\q2 and to trample them, trodden like mud of the streets.

\q1
\v 7 And he does not think so,
\q2 and his heart does not consider thus,
\q1 for, to destroy {is} in his heart,
\q2 and to eliminate not a few nations.
\q1
\v 8 For he says,
\q2 “{Are} not all my princes kings?
\q1
\v 9 {Is} not Kalno like Carchemish?
\q2 Surely Hamath {is} not like Arpad?
\q2 Surely Samaria {is} not like Damascus?

\q1
\v 10 As my hand has reached idolatrous kingdoms,
\q2 and their carved figures {were} greater than Jerusalem and greater than Samaria,
\q1
\v 11 just as I did to Samaria and her vanities,
\q2 shall I not do so to Jerusalem and to her idols?”

\ts\*
\m
\v 12 And it will happen, when the Lord has finished all his work against Mount Zion and against Jerusalem, “I shall reckon with the fruit of the magnitude of the heart of the king of Assyria and the pride of the haughtiness of his eyes.”
\ts\*
\p
\v 13 For he says:
\q1 “‘By my strength and by my hand I acted,
\q2 and {it is} in my wisdom, for I was discerning.
\q1 But I have removed the boundaries of the peoples,
\q2 and I have stolen their treasures,
\q2 and like a bull I have brought down the inhabitants.

\q1
\v 14 And my hand has seized, as {from} a nest
\q2 the wealth of the nations,
\q1 and as one gathers abandoned eggs,
\q2 I gathered all the earth,
\q1 and none was fluttering a wing
\q2 or opening a mouth or chirping.’”

\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 15 Will the ax glorify itself against the one who swings it?
\q2 Will the saw praise itself over him who wields it?
\q1 As a rod could wield those who raise it!
\q2 As a club could lift up {what is} not wood!
\q1
\v 16 Therefore, the Lord Yahweh of hosts
\q2 will send thinness among his fattened ones
\q1 and instead of his glory, a burning will rage,
\q2 like the burning of fire.

\q1
\v 17 And the light of Israel will become a fire,
\q2 and his Holy One a flame,
\q1 and it will burn and devour
\q2 his thorns and his briers in one day.
\q1
\v 18 And the glory of his forest and his fruitful land,
\q2 he will consume from spirit and to flesh,
\q2 and it will be like the wasting away of the frail.
\q1
\v 19 And the remnant of the trees of his forest will be a number
\q2 that a child could count.

\ts\*
\m
\v 20 And it will happen on that day, the remnant of Israel and the refugees of the house of Jacob will not continue anymore to rely on its afflicter, but will indeed rely on Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel.
\v 21 A remnant will return, a remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God.
\v 22 For though your people, Israel, are like the sand of the seashore, a remnant of it will return. Decreed destruction flows down, righteousness.
\v 23 For {it is} finished and decreed: the Lord Yahweh of hosts is about to carry {it} out throughout all the land.

\ts\*
\p
\v 24 Therefore, thus says the Lord Yahweh of hosts, “My people who live {in} Zion, do not fear the Assyrian. He will strike you with the rod and raise his staff against you in the way of Egypt
\v 25 for just a very little {time}; then the fury and my nose will end on account of their destruction.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 26 And Yahweh of hosts will wield a whip against it, as the smiting of Midian at the rock of Oreb. And his rod {will be} over the sea, and he will lift it up in the way of Egypt.
\v 27 And it will happen on that day,
\q1 his burden {will be} lifted from your shoulder and his yoke from your neck,
\q2
and the yoke will be destroyed from the face of fatness. \f + \ft The last line of this verse is difficult because it does not seem to fit the context. Some modern versions leave out \fqa from the face of fatness\fqa*.\f*

passed through Migron;

\q1 Ramah trembles,
\q2 Gibeah of Saul flees.

\q1
\v 30 Lift up your voice, daughter of Gallim!
\q2 Give attention, Laishah, poor of Anathoth!

\q1
\v 31 Madmenah flees,
\q2 the inhabitants of Gebim take refuge.

\v 32 Yet, today he will stand at Nob
\q2 wave his hand
\q2 {against} the mountain of the daughter of Zion,
\q2 the hill of Jerusalem.

\q1
\v 33 Behold, the Lord Yahweh of hosts
\q2 will cut off the foliage with a crash,
\q1 and the tallest of the tall {will be} cut down,

\q1
\v 34 And he will chop down the thickets of the forest with an ax,
\q2 and Lebanon will fall with force.

\q1
\v 1 And a shoot will come out from the stump of Jesse,
\q2 and a branch from his roots will bear fruit.

\q2
the Spirit of wisdom and understanding,
\q1
the Spirit of instruction and might,

the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of Yahweh,

\q1
And not by what his eyes see will he judge;
\q2
and he will not decide by what his ears hear,
\q1
\v 4 but he will judge the lowly righteously
\q2
and decide for the poor of the earth fairly.

\q1
And he will strike the earth with the rod of his mouth,
\q2
and with the breath of his lips he will slay the wicked,
\q1
\v 5 and righteousness will be the belt for his waist,
\q2
and faithfulness the strap for his hips.

\q1
\v 6 And the wolf will live with the lamb,

\q1
\v 7 And the cow and the bear will graze together;
\q2
their young will lie down together,
\q2 and the lion will eat straw like the ox.

\q1
\v 8 And an infant will play over the hole of the snake,
\q2
and the weaned child will stretch his hand over the den of the serpent.

\q1
\v 9 They will not hurt and they will not destroy
\q2 on all my holy mountain,

the root of Jesse that is standing,

the Lord will again extend his hand,

and it may be walked on in sandals.

\q1
\v 3 In their streets they wear sackcloth;

\q1
\v 4 And Heshbon and Elealeh cry out;

\v 6 For the waters of Nimrim are a desolation;

\q1 the vegetation is finished;
\q2 the greenery is not.

\v 7 Therefore, the abundance they have made and their stores
\q2 they carry away over the brook of the poplars.

\v 9 Indeed I shall weep in the weeping of Jazer,

\q2 it has been revealed to them.
\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 2 Be silent, you inhabitants of the coast;
\q2 the merchant of Sidon,
\q2 who travels over the sea, has filled you.
\q1
\v 3 And on the great waters {was} the grain of Shihor;
\q2 the harvest of the Nile {was} her produce,
\q2 and it became the commerce of the nations.

\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 4 Be ashamed, Sidon; for the sea has spoken, \q2 the mighty one of the sea, saying,
\q1 “I have not labored and I have not given birth,
\q2 and I have not raised young men {nor} brought up young women.”
\q1
\v 5 When the report {comes} to Egypt,
\q2 they will be grieved concerning the report of Tyre.

\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 6 Cross over to Tarshish;
\q2 wail, you inhabitants of the coast.
\q1
\v 7 Is this your joyful one,
\q2 whose origin {is} from ancient times,
\q1 whose feet carried her
\q2 far away to settle?

\q1
\v 8 Who has planned this
\q2 against Tyre, the giver of crowns,
\q1 whose merchants {are} princes,
\q2 whose traders {are} the honored ones of the earth?
\q1
\v 9 Yahweh of hosts has planned it
\q2 to dishonor the pride of all the glory,
\q1 to shame all the honored ones of the earth.

\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 10 Cross over your land like the Nile,
\q2 you daughter of Tarshish.
\q2 {There is} no restraint anymore.
\q1
\v 11 He has reached out his hand over the sea;
\q2 he has shaken the kingdoms.
\q1 Yahweh has commanded to Canaan
\q2 to destroy its strongholds.
\q1
\v 12 And he said,
\q1 “You will not continue to rejoice again,
\q2 you oppressed virgin daughter of Sidon;
\q1 arise, pass over {to} Cyprus;
\q2 there also you will not have rest.”

\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 13 Behold, the land of the Chaldeans.
\q2 This people is naught.
\q1 The Assyrians have established it for wild animals.
\q2 They erected their siege towers;
\q1 they demolished its palaces;
\q2 they made it ruins.
\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 14 Howl, you ships of Tarshish;
\q2 for your refuge has been destroyed.

\ts\*
\m
\v 15 And it will happen on that day that Tyre will be forgotten 70 years, like the days of one king. After the end of 70 years it will happen in Tyre like {in} the song of the prostitute:
\q1
\v 16 Take a harp,
\q2 go about the city,
\q2 you forgotten prostitute;
\q1 play well,
\q2 multiply song,
\q2 so that you may be remembered.

\ts\*
\m
\v 17 And it will happen, from the end of 70 years, Yahweh will visit Tyre, and she will return to her wages and to her prostitution of all the kingdoms of the earth on the face of the ground.
\v 18 And her profits and earnings will be set apart to Yahweh. They will not be stored up or kept in the treasury, for her profits will be given to those who live in Yahweh’s presence and will be used to supply them with abundant food and so they can have the best quality clothing.


\ts\*

\c 24
\q1
\v 1 Behold, Yahweh is about to empty the earth
\q2 and devastate it
\q1 and desecrate its face
\q2 and scatter its inhabitants.
\q1
\v 2 And it will happen,
\q2 as with the people, so with the priest;
\q2 as with the servant, so with his master;
\q2 as with the maid, so with her mistress;
\q2 as with the buyer, so with the seller;
\q2 as with the lender, so with the borrower;
\q2 as with the creditor, so with the lender of it.

\q1
\v 3 The earth will be completely devastated
\q2 and completely stripped,
\q2 for Yahweh has spoken this word.

\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 4 The earth dries up, is withered,
\q2 the world shrivels up, is withered,
\q2 the heights of the people of earth waste away.
\q1
\v 5 And the earth is polluted under its inhabitants
\q2 because they have transgressed the laws,
\q1 violated the statutes,
\q2 broken the everlasting covenant.

\q1
\v 6 Therefore a curse devours the earth,
\q2 and its inhabitants are found guilty.
\q1 Therefore the inhabitants of the earth burn up,
\q2 and few people {are} left.
\q1
\v 7 The new wine dries up,
\q2 the vine withers,
\q2 all the merry-hearted groan.

\q1
\v 8 The joy of the tambourines stops,
\q2 the revelry of celebrators ceases,
\q2 the joy of the lyre stops.
\q1
\v 9 Not with song do they drink wine;
\q2 strong drink is bitter to its drinkers.

\q1
\v 10 The city of chaos has been broken down;
\q2 every house is closed up from entering.
\q1
\v 11 {There is} a crying in the streets because of the wine;
\q2 all joy is darkened;
\q2 the gladness of the land has disappeared.

\q1
\v 12 In the city is left a desolation,
\q2 and the gate is broken into a ruin.
\q1
\v 13 For thus {it} will be in the midst of the earth
\q2 among the nations,
\q1 as when an olive tree is beaten,
\q2 as the gleanings when the grape harvest is done.

\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 14 They will lift up their voices, sing for joy,
\q2 in the majesty of Yahweh joyfully shout from the sea.
\q1
\v 15 Therefore, in the east glorify Yahweh,
\q2 in the isles of the sea, the name of Yahweh, the God of Israel.

\q1
\v 16 From the edge of the earth
\q2 we have heard songs: “Glory to the righteous one!”
\ts\*
\b
\q1 And I said, “I waste away,
\q2 I waste away, woe to me!
\q1 The treacherous have dealt treacherously;
\q2 with treachery the treacherous have dealt treacherously.”

\q1
\v 17 Terror and the pit and the snare
\q2 {are} upon you, inhabitants of the earth.
\q1
\v 18 And he who flees from the sound of terror
\q2 will fall into the pit,
\q1 and he who comes up from the middle of the pit
\q2 will be caught in the snare.
\ts\*
\b
\q1 For the windows of the heavens will be opened,
\q2 and the foundations of the earth will shake.

\q1
\v 19 The earth will be utterly shattered,
\q2 the earth will be completely broken;
\q2 the earth will be violently shaken.
\q1
\v 20 The earth will violently stagger like a drunkard,
\q2 and it will sway back and forth like a hut.
\q1 And its sin will be heavy on it
\q2 and it will fall and never rise again.

\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 21 And it will happen on that day,
\q2 Yahweh will punish the host of the heaven on high,
\q2 and the kings of the earth on the earth.
\q1
\v 22 And they will be gathered together,
\q2 prisoners in a pit,
\q1 and they will be shut up in a prison,
\q2 and after many days they will be punished.
\q1
\v 23 Then the white one will be ashamed,
\q2 and the hot one disgraced,
\q1 for Yahweh of hosts will reign
\q2 on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem,
\q1 and before his elders {is his} glory.


\ts\*

\c 25
\q1
\v 1 Yahweh, you {are} my God,
\q2 I shall exalt you; I shall praise your name;
\q1 for you have done wonders
\q2 planned long ago {in} perfect faithfulness.
\q1
\v 2 For you have made a town into a heap,
\q2 a fortified city into a ruin,
\q1 a fortress of strangers from a town,
\q2 it will not be built forever.
\q1
\v 3 Therefore a strong people will glorify you;
\q2 a city of ruthless nations will fear you.

\q1
\v 4 For you have been a fortress for the poor,
\q2 a fortress for the needy in his distress,
\q1 a shelter from the storm, a shade from the heat.
\q2 For the breath of the ruthless {is} like a storm {against} a wall,
\q2
\v 5 \q2 like heat in a dry land.
\q1 You subdued the noise of foreigners,
\q2 {as} the heat by the shade of a cloud.
\q2 the song of the ruthless is answered.

\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 6 And Yahweh of hosts will make for all peoples on this mountain
\q2 a feast of fat things,
\q1 a feast of choice wines,
\q2 fat things {full} of marrow, strained wine.
\q1
\v 7 And he will consume on this mountain
\q2 the face of the veil covering over all peoples
\q1 and the web woven over all the nations;
\q2
\v 8 he will swallow up death forever.
\q1 And the Lord Yahweh will wipe away tears
\q2 from off all faces.
\q1 And the disgrace of his people he will take away from all the earth,
\q2 for Yahweh has spoken.

\ts\*
\m
\v 9 And it will be said on that day,
\q1 “Behold, this {is} our God;
\q2 we have hoped in him, and he saved us.
\q1 This {is} Yahweh; we have hoped in him,
\q2 we shall be glad and rejoice in his salvation.”
\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 10 For on this mountain the hand of Yahweh will rest;
\q2 and Moab will be trampled down in his place,
\q2 as straw is trampled down in a dunghill.

\q1
\v 11 And it will spread its hands in the midst of it,
\q2 as the swimmer spreads {his hands} to swim.
\q1 But he will bring down its pride with the skill of its hands.
\q1
\v 12 And your high fortress walls he will bring down,
\q2 bring low, cast to the ground, to the dust.


\ts\*

\c 26
\p
\v 1 On that day this song will be sung in the land of Judah:
\q1 We have a strong city,
\q1 he has made salvation
\q2 {its} walls and ramparts.
\q1
\v 2 Open the gates,
\q2 that the righteous nation, keeper of faith, may enter in.

\q1
\v 3 The mind supported, you guard {in} peace—peace!—
\q2 for he trusts in you.
\q1
\v 4 Trust in Yahweh forever;
\q2 for in Yah, Yahweh, {is} an everlasting rock.

\q1
\v 5 For he will bring down
\q2 the inhabitants on high,
\q2 the fortified city.
\q1 He will it lay low,
\q2 he will lay it low to the ground,
\q2 he will level it to the dust.
\q1
\v 6 It will be trampled down {by} foot,
\q2 the feet of the poor,
\q2 the steps of the needy.

\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 7 The way for the righteous {is} level, Righteous One;
\q2 the path of the righteous you flatten.
\q1
\v 8 Yes, {in} the path of your judgments,
\q2 Yahweh, we wait {for} you;
\q1 your name and your reputation
\q2 {are} the delight of the spirit.
\q1
\v 9 With my soul, I have longed for you in the night;
\q2 Indeed, my spirit within me seeks you earnestly.
\q1 For when your judgments {are} on the earth,
\q2 the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.

\q1
\v 10 Let the wicked be favored;
\q2 he will not learn righteousness:
\q1 In the land of uprightness he acts wickedly
\q2 and does not see the majesty of Yahweh.

\q1
\v 11 Yahweh, {when} your hand is lifted up,
\q2 they do not perceive.
\q1 Let them see and be ashamed by the zeal for the people,
\q2 by the fire consuming your adversaries.
\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 12 Yahweh, you will establish peace for us,
\q2 for you have indeed accomplished all our works for us.

\q1
\v 13 Yahweh our God, lords besides you have ruled us;
\q2 only by you we recognize your name.
\q1
\v 14 {They are} dead, they will not live;
\q2 {they are} deceased, they will not arise.
\q1 Indeed, you visited and destroyed them,
\q2 and eradicated every memory of them.

\q1
\v 15 You have increased the nation, Yahweh,
\q2 you have increased the nation; you are honored;
\q2 you have extended all the borders of the land.

\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 16 Yahweh, in distress they visited you {with} uttered prayers,
\q2 your discipline {was} on them.
\q1
\v 17 As a pregnant {woman} nearing birth
\q2 writhes {and} cries out in labor pains,
\q2 so we have been before your face, Yahweh.

\q1
\v 18 We have been pregnant, we have been in labor,
\q2 as if we have birthed wind.
\q2 We have not brought salvation to the earth,
\q2 and the inhabitants of the world have not fallen.

\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 19 Your dead will live; their corpses will arise.
\q2 Awake and sing for joy, dwellers of the dust,
\q1 for your dew {is} the dew of light,
\q2 and the earth will release the dead.
\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 20 Go, my people, enter into your rooms,
\q2 and shut your doors behind you;
\q1 hide a little while,
\q2 until the fury has passed by.
\q1
\v 21 For behold, Yahweh is about to come out of his place
\q2 to charge the iniquity of the inhabitants of the earth against it,
\q1 and the earth will uncover her bloodshed,
\q2 and will no longer cover over her slain.


\ts\*

\c 27
\q1
\v 1 On that day Yahweh,
\q2 with his hard and great and fierce sword,
\q1 will punish Leviathan the slithering serpent,
\q2 Leviathan the squirming serpent,
\q2 and he will kill the monster that {is} in the sea.
\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 2 On that day,
\q2 a delightful vineyard, sing of it!
\q1
\v 3 “I, Yahweh, guard it.
\q2 I water it every moment.
\q1 lest {anyone} hurts it,
\q2 night and day I guard it.

\q1
\v 4 I do not have anger.
\q2 Oh, if they would give me briers {and} thorns,
\q1 in battle I would march against them;
\q2 I would burn them all together.
\q1
\v 5 If he takes hold of my protection,
\q2 he makes peace with me;
\q2 he makes peace with me.

\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 6 In the coming {day}, Jacob will take root,
\q2 Israel will blossom and bud,
\q2 and they will fill the face of the earth with fruit.”

\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 7 As the attacking of his attacker, has he attacked?
\q2 Or, like the slaying of his slain, was he slayed?
\q1
\v 8 In a measure, in sending her out,
\q2 you have contended with her.
\q1 He released his fierce breath on an east-wind day.
\q1
\v 9 So in this the iniquity of Jacob will be covered,
\q2 for this {will be} all the fruit of the removal of his sin:
\q1 when he will make all the altar stones
\q2 as chalk stones, crushed to pieces.
\q2 No Asherah poles or incense altars will stand.

\q1
\v 10 For the fortified city is desolate,
\q2 the habitation is deserted and forsaken, like the wilderness.
\q1 There a calf feeds,
\q2 and there he lies down and consumes its branches.
\q1
\v 11 When its boughs are dry, they will be broken.
\q2 Women will come, make fires with them,
\q2 for it is not a people of understanding.
\q1 Therefore, its Maker will not have compassion on them,
\q2 and its creator will not be merciful to them.

\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 12 And it will happen on that day:
\q1 Yahweh will thresh
\q2 from the Euphrates River to the Wadi of Egypt,
\q1 and you will be gathered,
\q2 one {by} one, sons of Israel.
\q1
\v 13 And it will happen on that day:
\q2 a great trumpet will be blown,
\q1 and the perishing in the land of Assyria will come,
\q2 and the outcasts in the land of Egypt,
\q1 and they will bow down to Yahweh
\q2 on the holy mountain in Jerusalem.


\ts\*

\c 28
\q1
\v 1 Woe, proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim,
\q2 and the fading flower of its glorious splendor,
\q2 which {is} on the head of the lush valley of those overcome {with} wine!
\q1
\v 2 Behold, one mighty and strong for my Lord.
\q2 Like a storm of hail, a destructive windstorm,
\q1 like a storm of mighty overflowing waters;
\q2 he brings down to the ground with his hand.
\q1
\v 3 The proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim
\q2 will be trodden by feet.
\q1
\v 4 And the fading flower of his glorious splendor
\q2 which {is} on the head of the lush valley,
\q1 will be as the firstfruits before the summer,
\q2 that when an onlooker sees it,
\q2 while it is yet in his palm, he swallows it.

\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 5 On that day Yahweh of hosts will become
\q2 a crown of splendor and a diadem of beauty for the remainder of his people,
\q1
\v 6 and a spirit of justice for him who sits in judgment,
\q2 and for strength of those who turn back war at the gates.

\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 7 But even these reel with wine
\q2 and stagger with strong drink.
\q1 The priest and the prophet reel with strong drink,
\q2 and they are swallowed up by wine.
\q1 They stagger with strong drink,
\q2 staggering in vision,
\q2 reeling in decision.
\q1
\v 8 For, all tables are covered with vomit of excrement,
\q2 without a {clean} place.

\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 9 To whom will he teach knowledge,
\q2 and to whom will he explain the message?
\q1 Those weaned from milk,
\q2 those taken from the breasts?
\q1
\v 10 For {it is} precept upon precept,
\q2 precept upon precept,
\q1 line upon line,
\q2 line upon line,
\q1 here a little, there a little.

\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 11 Indeed, with mocking lips and a strange tongue
\q2 he will speak to this people,
\q1
\v 12 to which he said,
\q2 “This {is} the rest—leave it for the weary.”
\q1 And “this {is} the refreshing”—
\q2 but they were not willing to listen.

\q1
\v 13 So the word of Yahweh will be to them
\q1 precept upon precept,
\q2 precept upon precept,
\q1 line upon line,
\q2 line upon line,
\q1 here a little, there a little.
\q1 so that they may go and fall backward,
\q2
and be broken and ensnared and captured.

\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 14 Therefore, hear the word of Yahweh,
\q2 men of mocking,
\q1 rulers of this people,
\q2 who {are} in Jerusalem.
\q1
\v 15 For you have said, “We have cut a covenant {with} death,
\q2 and with Sheol we have made an agreement.
\q1 The cascading whip, when it passes through,
\q2 it will not come to us.
\q1 For we have made falsehood our refuge,
\q2 and in lies we shelter.”

\ts\*
\m
\v 16 Therefore, thus says the Lord Yahweh:
\q1 See, I shall lay in Zion a stone, a tried stone,
\q2 a precious cornerstone, a sure foundation.
\q1 He who believes
\q2 will not be ashamed.

\q1
\v 17 And I shall make justice the measuring stick,
\q2 and righteousness the plumbline.
\q1 And hail will sweep away the refuge of falsehood,
\q2 and the waters will drown the hiding place.

\q1
\v 18 And your covenant {with} death will be dissolved,
\q2 and your agreement {with} Sheol will not stand.
\q1 The cascading whip that passes through,
\q2 you will be overwhelmed by it.
\q1
\v 19 When it passes through, it will take you,
\q2 for it will pass through morning by morning, by day and night,
\q1 and to understand the message
\q2 will be only terror.

\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 20 For the bed {is} too short to stretch out {on},
\q2 and the blanket {too} narrow to wrap oneself.
\q1
\v 21 Yahweh will rise up as {on} Mount Perazim;
\q2 he will rouse himself as in the Valley of Gibeon
\q1 to do his work, his strange work,
\q2 and to perform his deed, his strange deed.

\q1
\v 22 And now, do not mock,
\q2 lest your bonds be tightened.
\q1 For I have heard: destruction is decreed
\q2 from the Lord Yahweh of hosts
\q2 over all the earth.

\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 23 Give ear and hear my voice;
\q2 listen closely and hear my words.
\q1
\v 24 Does a farmer plows all day to sow?
\q2 Does he break up and harrow the ground?

\q1
\v 25 Does he not level its face,
\q2 and scatter fennel, and sow the cumin,
\q1 and put the wheat {in} rows,
\q2 and the barley in plots,
\q2 and the spelt at its border?
\q1
\v 26 And His God instructs him;
\q2 he teaches him wisely.

\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 27 For fennel is not threshed with a threshing board,
\q2 nor is the wheel of a cart rolled over cumin;
\q1 but fennel is beaten with a stick,
\q2 and cumin with a rod.
\q1
\v 28 For bread it must be ground,
\q2 so the thresher does not thresh it forever,
\q1 and he runs {it} over {with} the wheels of his cart
\q2 but his horses do not crush it.

\q1
\v 29 This too comes from Yahweh of hosts,
\q2 wonderful {in} counsel, his wisdom great.


\ts\*

\c 29
\q1
\v 1 Woe, Ariel, Ariel,
\q2 the city {where} David encamped!
\q1 Add year to year;
\q2 let the festivals come round.
\q1
\v 2 And I shall cause distress to Ariel,
\q2 and she will be mourning and lamenting;
\q2 and she will be to me like Ariel.

\q1
\v 3 And I shall encamp against you in a circle
\q2 and lay siege against you {with} siege-works,
\q2 and raise against you fortresses.
\q1
\v 4 And you will be brought down and will speak from the ground;
\q2 your speech will be low from the dust,
\q1 and your voice will be like {that of} a spirit from the ground,
\q2 and out of the dust your speech will whisper.

\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 5 And the horde of your strangers will be like fine dust,
\q2 and the horde of the oppressors as chaff passing through.
\q2 And it will happen suddenly, in an instant.
\q1
\v 6 She will be visited by Yahweh of hosts
\q2 with thunder and with earthquake and a great noise,
\q2 a storm and a tempest and the flames of a devouring fire.

\q1
\v 7 And it will be like a dream, a vision of the night:
\q2 A horde of all the nations will come out against Ariel
\q1 and all her assembly and her stronghold, and they will press upon her.
\q1
\v 8 And it will be like a hungry dreamer; and behold: he is eating,
\q2 but he awakes, and his stomach {is} empty.
\q1 Or, like a thirsty dreamer; and behold: he is drinking,
\q2 but he awakes, and behold: {he is} fainting and his thirst active.
\q1 So will be the throng of all the nations
\q2 coming out against Mount Zion.

\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 9 Astonish yourselves and be astonished; blind yourselves and be blind!
\q1 Be drunk, but not {with} wine; stagger, but not {with} strong drink.
\q1
\v 10 For Yahweh has poured out on you
\q2 the spirit of deep sleep
\q1 and has closed your eyes, the prophets,
\q2 and has covered your heads, the seers.

\ts\*
\m
\v 11 And all revelation has become to you as the words of a sealed book, that which {one} might give to one who is book-learned, saying, “Please read this.” And he says, “I am not able, for it {is} sealed,”
\v 12 or {if} the book is given to {one} who {is} not book-learned, saying, “Please read this,” and he says, “I am not book-learned.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 13 And the Lord said,
\q1 “Because this people comes close with its mouths
\q2 and honors me with its lips,
\q2 but its heart {is} far from me,
\q1 and their fear for me
\q2 is a commandment of men {that} has been taught!
\q1
\v 14 Therefore, behold, I shall continue to do wonders {with} this people,
\q2 making wonders and wonders.
\q1 And the wisdom of its wise will perish,
\q2 and the understanding of its discerning will hide itself.”
\q1
\v 15 Woe, those burying deeply
\q2 to hide a plan from Yahweh,
\q1 and in darkness are their deeds, and they say,
\q2 “Who sees us, and who knows us?”

\q1
\v 16 You reverse {things}!
\q2 Should the potter be considered like clay,
\q1 so the made should say of its maker,
\q2 “He did not make me,”
\q1 or the created say of its creator,
\q2 “He does not understand”?

\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 17 Is {it} not {in} just a very little {time} that Lebanon will be turned into a field,
\q2 and the field will be considered a forest?
\q1
\v 18 And on that day the deaf will hear the words of the scroll,
\q2 and from the deep and from the darkness,
\q2 the eyes of the blind will see.
\q1
\v 19 And the poor will again be glad in Yahweh,
\q2 and the needy of mankind will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.

\q1
\v 20 For the ruthless will cease,
\q2 and the scoffer will vanish,
\q1 and all those lying in wait for evil will be cut down,
\q1
\v 21 who make a man guilty with a word
\q2 and lay a trap for the judge at the gate
\q2 and turn away the righteous with emptiness.

\ts\*
\m
\v 22 Therefore, thus says Yahweh—who redeemed Abraham—to the house of Jacob:
\q1 “Now Jacob will not be ashamed,
\q2 and now his face will not be pale.
\q1
\v 23 But when he sees his children,

\v 1 “Woe, rebellious children”
\q2 —the declaration of Yahweh
\q1 “Making plans, but not mine,
\q2 and pouring out libations, but not {by} my Spirit,
\q2 so adding sin upon sin.
\q1
\v 2 Those going down {into} Egypt,
\q2 —but my mouth have not asked—
\q1 to have strength in the fortress of Pharaoh
\q2 and to refuge in the shadow of Egypt.

\q1
\v 3 But the fortress of Pharaoh will be for you shame,
\q2 and the refuge in the shade of Egypt, for humiliation.
\q1
\v 4 Though its princes are at Zoan,
\q2 and their messengers have reached Hanes,
\q1
\v 5 all will be ashamed
\q2 because of a people not benefiting them:
\q1 not help and not aid,

\v 6 An oracle for the beasts of the Negev:
\q1 Through the land of trouble and danger
\q2 —from {it} are the lioness and the lion,
\q2 the viper and fiery flying serpent—
\q1 they carry their riches on the shoulders of donkeys
\q2 and their treasures on the humps of camels
\q1 to a people not benefiting {them},
\q2
\v 7 for Egypt helps {in} emptiness and uselessness.
\q1 Therefore, I have called her:
\q2 Rahab the Do-Nothing.

\v 8 Now go, write it on a tablet before them
\q2 and on a scroll inscribe it,
\q1 that it may be for the time to come
\q2 as a testimony until forever.
\q1
\v 9 For it {is} a rebellious people, false sons,
\q2 sons not willing to hear the law of Yahweh,

\q1
\v 10 who say to the seers,
\q2 “Do not see,”
\q1 and to the prophets,
\q2 “Do not prophesy the truth to us!
\q1 Speak flattery to us;
\q2 prophesy illusions.
\q1
\v 11 Turn aside from the way,
\q2 stray from the path;
\q1 cease {speaking of} before our faces
\q2 the Holy One of Israel.”

\ts\*
\m
\v 12 Therefore, thus says the Holy One of Israel:
\q1 “Because you reject this word
\q2 and trust in oppression and corruption
\q2 and lean on it,
\q1
\v 13 so this sin will be to you
\q2 like a crack falling, a bulge in a high wall
\q2 whose breach comes suddenly, in an instant.

\q1
\v 14 And whose breaking {is} like the breaking of the vessel of a potter,
\q2 shattered {with} no pity,
\q1 so no shard is found among its fragments
\q2 to scrape fire from the hearth,
\q2 or to draw water out of the cistern.”

\ts\*
\m
\v 15 For thus says the Lord Yahweh, the Holy One of Israel:
\q1 “In returning and resting you will be saved;
\q2 in quietness and in confidence will be your strength.
\q2 But you were not willing.
\q1
\v 16 And you said, ‘No, for on horses we shall flee,’
\q2 so you will flee;
\q1 and, ‘We shall ride upon swift {horses},’
\q2 so those who pursue you will be swift.

\q1
\v 17 One thousand from the face of the threat of one;
\q2 from the face of the threat of five you will flee
\q1 until you are left like a flagstaff on the top of a mountain,
\q2 or like a flag on a hill.”

\q1
\v 18 And yet Yahweh is waiting to be gracious to you,
\q2 and therefore, he rises to show you mercy.
\q1 For a God of justice {is} Yahweh;
\q2 blessed {are} all who wait for him.
\m
\v 19 For people in Zion, dweller in Jerusalem, you will surely not weep. He will surely be gracious to you at the sound of your cry. When he hears it, he will answer you.
\v 20 Though the Lord gives you the bread of adversity and the water of affliction, even so, your teacher will not hide himself anymore, but your eyes will see your teacher,
\v 21 and your ears will hear a word behind you saying, “This {is} the way, walk in it,” when you turn to the right or when you turn to the left.
\v 22 And you will desecrate your silver-overlaid idols and your gold-plated figures. You will throw them away like a menstrual rag. You will say to them, “Get out!”

\ts\*
\p
\v 23 And he will give rain for your seed when you sow the ground, and bread of the produce of the ground, and {it} will be rich and fat. In that day your cattle will graze {in} broad pastures.
\v 24 And the oxen and the donkeys, plowers of the ground, will eat seasoned feed that has been winnowed with a shovel and a fork.
\v 25 And on every high mountain and on every tall hill will be streams, rivers of waters, in the day of the great slaughter when the towers fall.
\v 26 And the light of the white one will be like the light of the hot one, and the light of the hot one will be seven {times}, like the light of seven days in a day. Yahweh will bind up the breakdown of his people and heal the bruises of his wounding.

\v 28 And his breath is like a torrent
\q2 rising to the middle of the neck
\q1 to sift the nations with the sieve of destruction,

\q2 and show the descent of his arm
\q1 in raging nose and flames of a consuming fire,

\q2 which Yahweh will lay on them
\q1 will be with tambourines and harps
\q2 as he fights against them in battle, waving {his arm}.

\v 33 For a place of cremation {was} arranged long ago.
\q2 Indeed, it is prepared for the king.

\q2 and does not cower at their clamor—

\q1
\v 9 And his rock will pass away at the terror,

\q1
\v 5 The fool will no longer be called honorable,

\q1 He makes the hungry appetite empty,
\q2 and the thirsty he causes to lack drink.

\q1
\v 7 And the deceiver, his methods {are} evil.
\q2 He plans wickedness
\q1 to ruin the poor with sayings of falsehood,

\v 13 On the land of my people

\q2 a delight of wild donkeys, a pasture of flocks;
\q1
\v 15 until the Spirit is poured on us from on high,
\q2 and the wilderness becomes an orchard,

\v 1 And it happened in the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib, king of Assyria went up against all the fortified cities of Judah and captured them.
\v 2 Then the king of Assyria sent the chief commander from Lachish to Jerusalem to King Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood by the conduit of the upper pool on the highway of the Field of the Fuller.
\v 3 And Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who {was} over the court, and Shebna the scribe and Joah son of
 Asaph the recorder went out to him.

\ts\*
\p
\v 4 And the chief commander said to them, “Please say to Hezekiah,
\q1 ‘thus says the great king, the king of Assyria, What {is} this confidence in which you trust?
\v 5 You said mere words of lips {are} counsel and strength for war. Now in whom are you trusting that you rebel against me?
\v 6 Behold, you are trusting in the staff of this splintered reed, in Egypt, which, when a man leans on it, then it will go into his palm and pierce it. Thus {is} Pharaoh king of Egypt to all who trust in him.
\v 7 But if you say to me, “We are trusting in Yahweh our God,” {is} it not he whose high places and altars Hezekiah has taken away and has said to Judah and to Jerusalem, “You must worship before the face of this altar”?

\ts\*
\q1
\v 8 So now, wager, please, {with} my lord the king of Assyria. And I will give to you 2000 horses, if you are able to set for yourselves riders on them.
\v 9 And how could you drive back the face of one captain of the humblest servants of my lord? But you yourself have trusted in Egypt for chariots and horsemen!
\v 10 And now, have I come up without Yahweh to this land to destroy it? Yahweh said to me, “Go up to this land and destroy it.”’”

\ts\*
\m
\v 11 Then Eliakim and Shebnah and Joah said to the chief commander, “Please speak Aramaic to your servants, for we understand {it}. And do not speak with us Judean in the ears of the people who {are} on the wall.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 12 But the chief commander said, “Has my master sent me to your master and to you to speak these words? Is it not to the men who sit on the wall, eating their dung and drinking their urine with you?”

\ts\*
\p
\v 13 Then the chief commander stood and called out in a loud voice {in} Judean and said, “Hear the words of the great king, the king of Assyria.
\v 14 Thus says the king, ‘Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for he will not be able to rescue you.
\v 15 And do not let Hezekiah make you trust in Yahweh, saying, “Yahweh will surely rescue us; this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.”’

\ts\*
\p
\v 16 Do not listen to Hezekiah, for thus says the king of Assyria: ‘Make terms with me and come out to me. Then {every} man will eat of his vine and {every} man his fig tree, and {every} man will drink the water of his cistern
\v 17 until I come and take you away to a land like your land, a land of grain and new wine, a land of bread and vineyards.’

\ts\*
\p
\v 18 Lest Hezekiah mislead you, saying, ‘Yahweh will rescue us.’ Did the gods of the peoples rescue {every} man of his land from the hand of the king of Assyria?
\v 19 Where {are} the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where {are} the gods of Sepharvaim? And have they rescued Samaria from my hand?
\v 20 Who among all the gods of these lands, who has rescued his land from my hand, as if Yahweh could save Jerusalem from my hand?”

\v 21 But they were silent and did not respond {to} him a word, for the command of the king was, saying, “Do not answer him.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 22 Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, who {was} over the court, and Shebna the scribe and Joah son of Asaph the recorder came to Hezekiah {with} clothes torn and reported to him the words of the chief commander.

\c 37
\p
\v 1 And it happened when King Hezekiah heard, then he tore his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of Yahweh.
\v 2 And he sent Eliakim, who {was} over the court, and Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with sackcloth, to Isaiah son of Amoz, the prophet.
\v 3 And they said to him, “Thus says Hezekiah, ‘This day {is} a day of distress and rebuke and disgrace, as sons coming to the opening of the womb, but there is no strength to give birth.
\v 4 Perhaps Yahweh your God will hear the words of the chief commander, whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to defy the living God and will rebuke the words which Yahweh your God has heard. So, lift up a prayer for the remaining remnant.’”

\ts\*
\p
\v 5 And the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah,

\v 7 Behold, I shall put a spirit in him, and he will hear a report and go back to his land. And I shall cause him to fall by the sword in his land.”’”

\v 9 And he heard about Tirhakah king of Cush, saying “He has gone out to fight against you,” and he heard {it}, so he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,
\v 10 “Thus you shall say to Hezekiah, king of Judah, saying, ‘Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, “Jerusalem will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria.”
\v 11 Behold, you have heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all lands by destroying them completely. And will you be rescued?
\v 12 Have the gods of the nations rescued them whom my fathers destroyed: Gozan and Haran and Rezeph, and the sons of Eden who {were} in Tel Assar?
\v 13 Where {is} the king of Hamath and the king of Arpad and the king of the cities of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?’”

\ts\*
\p
\v 14 And Hezekiah received the writings from the hand of the messengers and read it. Then he went up {to} the house of Yahweh. And Hezekiah spread it out before the face of Yahweh.
\v 15 And Hezekiah prayed to Yahweh, saying,
\v 16 “Yahweh of hosts, God of Israel, sitting {by} the cherubim, you {are} he: you alone {are} God over all the kingdoms of the earth. {It is} you {who} made the heavens and the earth.
\v 17 Turn your ear, Yahweh, and listen. Open your eyes, Yahweh, and see, and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which he has sent to mock the living God.

\ts\*
\p
\v 18 Indeed, Yahweh, the kings of Assyria have destroyed all the nations and their land.
\v 19 And they have put their gods into the fire, for they {were} not gods but the work of the hands of man, wood and stone. And they have destroyed them.
\v 20 And now, Yahweh our God, save us from his hand; then all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you {are} Yahweh, you alone.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 21 Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, “Thus says Yahweh, the God of Israel, ‘Because you have prayed to me concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria,
\v 22 this {is} the word that Yahweh has spoken about him:
\q1 “The virgin daughter of Zion
\q2 despises you, scorns you;
\q1 the daughter of Jerusalem
\q2 shakes {her} head at you.
\q1
\v 23 Whom have you defied and insulted?
\q2 And against whom have you exalted {your} voice
\q1 and lifted upward your eyes?
\q2 Against the Holy One of Israel.

\q1
\v 24 By the hand of your servants
\q2 you have defied the Lord
\q1 and you have said,
\q2 ‘With the multitude of my chariots
\q1 I have gone up to the heights of the mountains,
\q2 the reaches of Lebanon.
\q1 And I shall cut down its tall cedars, its choice cypresses,
\q2 and I shall enter into its farthest high places, its most fruitful forest.
\q1
\v 25 {It is} I who has dug and drunk water;\f + \ft Some ancient manuscripts have \fqa I have dug wells and drunk water in foreign lands.\fqa*\f*
\q2 And I dried up all the rivers of Egypt with the soles of my feet.’

\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 26 Have you not heard?
\q2 Long ago I determined it,
\q1 and made it from days of old.
\q2 Now I am bringing it to pass,
\q1 that you should devastate the fortressed cities {to} heaps of ruins.
\q1
\v 27 And their inhabitants, those short of hand,
\q2 are dismayed and ashamed.
\q1 They are plants of the field and green grass, grass of the roof or the field,
\q2 before the face of the east wind.

\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 28 “But your sitting down
\q2 and your going out and your coming in, I know
\q2 and your raging against me.
\q1
\v 29 Because of your raging against me,
\q2 and your arrogance coming up to my ears,
\q1 so I shall put my hook in your nose,
\q2 and my bit in your mouth,
\q1 and I shall turn you back to
\q2 the way by which you came.”

\ts\*
\m
\v 30 And this {will be} the sign for you:
\q1 “This year you will eat wild plants,
\q2 and in the second year the after-growth.
\q1 But in the third year you must sow and harvest
\q2 and plant vineyards and eat the fruit.

\ts\*
\q1
\v 31 And the surviving remnant of the house of Judah will again take root below and produce fruit above.
\q1
\v 32 For from Jerusalem a remnant will come out,
\q2 and survivors from Mount Zion.
\q2 The zeal of Yahweh of hosts will do this.’”

\ts\*
\m
\v 33 Therefore, thus says Yahweh about the king of Assyria:
\q1 “He will not come into this city
\q2 and he will not shoot an arrow here.
\q1 And he will not bring near it a shield
\q2 and he will not build up against it siegeworks.
\q1
\v 34 The way by which he came, he will return {in},
\q2 and he will not enter to this city”
\q2 —the declaration of Yahweh—
\q1
\v 35 “and I shall protect over this city, rescuing it,
\q2 for my sake and for the sake of David my servant.”

\ts\*
\m
\v 36 Then the angel of Yahweh went out and struck 185, 000 of the camp of Assyria. And they rose early in the morning, and behold, all of them {were} dead bodies.
\v 37 Then Sennacherib king of Assyria departed and traveled and went back. And he stayed in Nineveh.

\ts\*
\p
\v 38 And it happened, he was worshiping {in} the house of Nisrok his god, and his sons Adrammelek and Sharezer struck him with the sword. And they escaped {into} the land of Ararat. And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his place.

\v 1 In those days Hezekiah was sick to {the point of} death. So Isaiah son of Amoz, the prophet, came to him and said to him, “Thus says Yahweh, ‘Set your house in order, for you will die and not live.’”

\ts\*
\p
\v 2 And Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to Yahweh.
\v 3 And he said, “O Yahweh, please remember how I have faithfully walked before your face with my whole heart and done good in your sight.” And Hezekiah wept great tears.

\ts\*
\p
\v 4 And the word of Yahweh was to Isaiah, saying,
\v 5 “Go and say to Hezekiah, ‘Thus says Yahweh, the God of David your father: I have heard your prayer; I have seen your tears. Behold, I shall add on your days 15 years.
\v 6 And I shall rescue you and this city from the hand of the king of Assyria and defend this city.

\ts\*
\p
\v 7 And this {will be} the sign to you from Yahweh, that Yahweh will do this word that he said.

\v 9 A writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick and recovered from his sickness:

\v 10 I said, “In the middle of my days
\q2 I will go through the gates of Sheol;
\q2 I am summoned {there} the rest of my years.”
\q1
\v 11 I said, “I will not see Yah,

\q1
\v 12 My dwelling is removed and carried away from me
\q2 like the tent of a shepherd;
\q1 I have rolled up my life like a weaver;
\q2 he is cutting me off from the loom;
\q2 from day to night you are finishing me.
\q1
\v 13 I cried out\f + \ft The Hebrew could be read: \fqa I cried out\fqa* or \fqa I lie down.\fqa*\f*
until the morning;
\q2 like a lion, thus he breaks all my bones.
\q2 From day to night you are finishing me.

\q1
\v 14 Like a swallow, thus I chirp;
\q2 I coo like a dove;
\q1 my eyes grow tired {with looking} upward.

\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 15 What shall I say?
\q2 And he has said to me, and he has done {it};
\q1 I will walk softly all my years
\q2 because of the bitterness of my spirit.

\q1
\v 16 Lord, on them {men} live,
\q2 and in all of them {is} the life of my spirit.
\q2 And you have restored me and given me life.
\q1
\v 17 Behold, for {my} wellbeing
\q2 bitter bitterness {was} for me.
\q1 But you have held back my life
\q2 from the pit of nothingness,
\q1 for you have thrown all my sins
\q2 behind your back.

\q1
\v 18 For Sheol does not thank you,
\q2 {or} death praise you;
\q1 those who go down {into} the pit do not wait
\q2 for your trustworthiness.
\q1
\v 19 The living, the living! {It is} he who gives you thanks,

\v 21 Now Isaiah had said, “They shall take a lump of figs and plaster {it} on the boil, and he will live.”

\ts\*

\c 39
\p
\v 1 At that time Marduk-Baladan, son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah, for he had heard that he had been sick and had recovered.
\v 2 And Hezekiah was pleased by them, and he showed them the storehouse of his valuables—the silver and the gold and the spices and the precious oil, and the whole storehouse of his weapons, and all that was found in his treasures. There was not a thing in his house or in all his kingdom that Hezekiah did not show them.

\ts\*
\p
\v 3 Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and said to him, “What did these men say to you, and where did they come from?”

\ts\*
\p
 And Hezekiah said, “They came to me from a distant land, from Babylon.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 4 And Isaiah said, “What have they seen in your house?”
\ts\*
\p
And Hezekiah answered, “They have seen everything that {is} in my house. There is not a thing that I have not shown them in my treasures.”

\ts\*
\p
\v 5 Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, “Listen to the word of Yahweh of hosts:
\v 6 ‘Behold, the days are coming when everything that {is} in your house and that your fathers stored away until this day will be carried {to} Babylon. Not a thing will be left, says Yahweh.
\v 7 And from the sons whom you have brought forth from yourself, whom you have fathered, they will take away, and they will become eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon.’”

\q1 which he has shown us according to his mercy,
\q2 and according to the greatness of his covenant faithfulness.
\q1
\v 8 And he said, “Indeed they {are} my people,
\q2 sons not unfaithful,”
\q2 and he became their Savior.

\q1
\v 9 Through all their affliction he was afflicted,
\q2 and the angel of his face saved them.
\q1 In his love and mercy he redeemed them,
\q2 and he lifted them up and carried them
\q2 all the days of old.

\q1
\v 10 But they rebelled
\q2 and grieved his Holy Spirit.
\q1 And he became their enemy;
\q2 he fought against them.

\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 11 And his people recalled the days of old of Moses,
\q2 “Where {is} the one who brought them up from the sea
\q1 with the shepherds of his flock?
\q2 Where {is} the one who put his Holy Spirit among them,

\q1
\v 12 who sent his glorious arm
\q2 to the right hand of Moses,
\q1 who divided the water before their faces,
\q2 to make for himself an everlasting name,
\q1
\v 13 who led them through the depths?
\q2 Like a horse on flat land, they did not stumble;

\q1
\v 14 as cattle going down into the valley,
\q2 the Spirit of Yahweh gave them rest.
\q1 So you led your people,
\q2 to make yourself a name of majesty.

\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 15 Look from heaven and see
\q2 from your holy and glorious habitation.
\q1 Where {are} your zeal and your mighty acts?
\q2 The agitation of your inner parts and your compassion are restrained from me.
\q1
\v 16 For you {are} our Father,
\q2 though Abraham does not know us
\q2 and Israel does not recognize us,
\q1 you, Yahweh, {are} our father.
\q2 Our Redeemer from everlasting {is} your name.

\q1
\v 17 Yahweh, why do you make us wander from your ways,
\q2 harden our hearts, so we do not fear you?
\q1 Return for your servants’ sake,
\q2 the tribes of your inheritance.

\q1
\v 18 For a short time your holy people possessed your holy place;
\q2 our enemies trampled {it}.
\q1
\v 19 We have become {like} those over whom you did not ever rule,
\q2 {like} those who were not called by your name.”


\ts\*

\c 64
\q1
\v 1 Oh, if you had split open the heavens and come down!
\q2 The mountains would have shaken at your presence,
\q1
\v 2 as fire kindles the brushwood,
\q2 {or} fire boils water
\q1 to make your name known by your adversaries,
\q2 before your face nations tremble.

\q1
\v 3 When you did fearful things we had not hoped {for},
\q2 you came down; before your face the mountains trembled.

\q1
\v 4 And from ancient times they have not heard;
\q2 they have not given ear;
\q1 no eye has seen a god besides you,
\q2 who works for him who waits for him.

\q1
\v 5 You meet him who rejoices in doing righteousness,
\q2 who recalls your ways.
\q1 Behold, you were angry for we had sinned;
\q2 through them of old we would be saved.

\q1
\v 6 And all of us have become like an unclean one,
\q2 and all our righteous deeds {are} like a menstrual rag.
\q1 And we have withered like leaves, all of us,
\q2 and our iniquities, like the wind, carry us away.
\q1
\v 7 And there are none who calls on your name,
\q2 who stirs himself up to take hold of you.
\q1 For you have hidden your face from us
\q2 and made us waste away in the hand of our iniquities.

\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 8 And yet, Yahweh, our Father you {are}.
\q2 We {are} the clay, and you {are} our potter;
\q2 and we all {are} the work of your hand.
\q1
\v 9 Do not be angry beyond measure, Yahweh,
\q2 and do not forever remember iniquity.
\q2 Behold, look, please, all of us {are} your people.

\q1
\v 10 Your holy cities have become a wilderness;
\q2 Zion has become a wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.
\q1
\v 11 Our holy and beautiful temple, where our fathers praised you,
\q2 has been burned {in} fire,
\q2 and all our beloved things are in ruins.
\q1
\v 12 At these, will you restrain yourself, Yahweh?
\q2 Will you remain silent and humiliate us beyond measure?

\c 65
\q1
\v 1 “I let myself be sought out by {those who} did not ask;
\q2 I let myself be found by {those who} did not seek.
\q1 I said, ‘Here I {am}! Here I {am}!’
\q2 to a nation not calling on my name.
\q1
\v 2 I have spread out my hands all day to a stubborn people,
\q1 who walk a not-good way, after their thoughts,

\q1
\v 3 a people who continually provoke me to my face,
\q2 offering sacrifices in gardens,
\q2 and burning incense on bricks,
\q1
\v 4 who sit among the graves
\q2 and spend the night in lookouts;
\q1 who eat the meat of the pig
\q2 and the broth of unclean meat {in} their dishes,

\q1
\v 5 who say, ‘Keep to yourself, do not come near to me,
\q2 for I am holier than you.’
\q1 These things {are} smoke in my nose,
\q2 a fire burning all day long.

\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 6 Behold, {it is} written before my face:
\q2 I shall not keep quiet, but I shall repay,
\q2 and I shall repay into their laps,
\q1
\v 7 their sins and the sins of their fathers together,”
\q2 says Yahweh.
\q1 “Because they have burned incense on the mountains
\q2 and on the hills mocked me.
\q1 And I shall measure out
\q2 their past deeds into their laps.”

\ts\*
\m
\v 8 Thus says Yahweh,
\q1 “As when juice is found in a cluster of grapes,
\q2 and {one} says, ‘Do not ruin it, for {there is} good in it,’
\q1 therefore I shall work for the sake of my servant;
\q2 I shall not ruin all.

\q1
\v 9 And I shall bring seed from Jacob,
\q2 and from Judah a possessor of my mountains,
\q1 and my chosen ones will possess it,
\q2 and my servants will live there.
\q1
\v 10 And Sharon will become a pasture for the flocks,
\q2 and the Valley of Achor a resting place for herds,
\q2 for my people who seek me.

\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 11 But you who abandon Yahweh,
\q2 who forget my holy mountain,
\q1 who prepare for Fortune a table,
\q2 and fill for Destiny mixed wine,

\q1
\v 12 then I shall appoint you for the sword,
\q2 and you will all bow down to the slaughter,
\q1 because I called and you did not answer;
\q2 I spoke, and you did not listen.
\q1 But you did evil in my eyes
\q2 and what was not pleasing to me you chose.”

\ts\*
\m
\v 13 Therefore, thus says the Lord Yahweh:
\q1 “Behold, my servants will eat,
\q2 but you will be hungry;
\q1 behold, my servants will drink,
\q2 but you will be thirsty;
\q1 behold, my servants will rejoice,
\q2 but you will be put to shame.
\q1
\v 14 Behold, my servants will shout with joy from gladness of heart,
\q2 but you will cry from pain of the heart,
\q2 and from the crushing of the spirit you will wail.

\q1
\v 15 And you will leave your name as a curse to my chosen ones;
\q2 and the Lord Yahweh will put you to death,
\q2 and he will call his servants {by} another name.
\q1
\v 16 Whoever blesses himself on the earth
\q2 will bless himself by the God of truth,
\q1 and who vows on the earth
\q2 will vow by the God of truth,
\q1 for the former troubles will be forgotten,
\q2 for they will be hidden from my eyes.
\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 17 For behold, I am about to create a new heavens
\q2 and a new earth;
\q1 and the former things will not be remembered,
\q2 and they will not come up to heart.
\q1
\v 18 But you will be glad and rejoice forever in
\q2 what I am about to create.
\q1 For behold, I am about to create Jerusalem {as} rejoicing,
\q2 and her people {as} joy.
\q1
\v 19 And I will rejoice over Jerusalem
\q2 and be glad over my people;
\q1 and it will no longer be heard in her
\q2 the sound of weeping and the sound of screaming.

\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 20 No more will an infant be there {a few} days,
\q2 or an elder who does not complete his days.
\q1 For, one who dies {at} 100 years old {will be} a young lad,
\q1 and one who falls short of 100 years old {will be considered} cursed.
\q1
\v 21 And they will build houses and dwell,
\q2 and they will plant vineyards and eat fruit.

\q1
\v 22 They will not build for another to dwell;
\q2 they will not plant for another to eat;
\q1 for as the days of trees {will be} the days of my people,
\q2 and the work of their hands my chosen ones will outlive.
\q1
\v 23 They will not labor in vain,
\q2 and they will not give birth to dismay;
\q1 for the seed of the blessed of Yahweh they {are},
\q2 and their offspring with them.

\q1
\v 24 And it will happen, before they call, then I shall answer;
\q2 {while} they are still speaking, then I shall hear.
\q1
\v 25 The wolf and the lamb will graze together,
\q2 and the lion like the ox will eat straw;
\q2 but the serpent—dust {is} its food.
\q1 They will not do evil, and they will not destroy
\q2 on all my holy mountain,” says Yahweh.


\ts\*

\c 66
\p
\v 1 Thus says Yahweh,
\q1 “Heaven {is} my throne,
\q2 and the earth {is} the stool for my feet.
\q1 Where {is} the house that you will build for me?
\q2 And where {is} the place {where} I may rest?

\q1
\v 2 And all these my hand has made;
\q2 thus all these came to be”
\q2 —the declaration of Yahweh.
\ts\*
\b
\q1 “And to this one I look,
\q2 to the broken and contrite of spirit,
\q2 and who trembles at my word.

\q1
\v 3 He who slaughters an ox strikes down a man;
\q2 he who sacrifices a lamb breaks the neck of a dog;
\q1 he who brings up a grain offering {offers} the blood of a pig;
\q2 he who offers a memorial of incense blesses wickedness.
\q1 They, too, have chosen their ways,
\q2 and in their abominations their spirit delights.

\q1
\v 4 Even so, I shall choose their punishment,
\q2 and their fears I shall bring on them,
\q1 because I called, and no one answered;
\q2 I spoke, and no one listened.
\q1 And they did evil before my eyes,
\q2 and what I did not desire, they chose.”

\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 5 Hear the word of Yahweh,
\q2 who tremble at his word,
\q1 Your brothers who hate you have said,
\q2 —who exclude you for the sake of my name—
\q1 “May Yahweh be glorified,
\q2 and we will see your joy,”
\q2 but they will be put to shame.

\q1
\v 6 The sound of uproar from the city,
\q2 a sound from the temple,
\q1 the sound of Yahweh
\q2 repaying completely his enemies.

\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 7 “Before she goes into labor, she gives birth;
\q1 before pain comes upon her, then she delivers a male.
\q1
\v 8 Who has heard of such a thing?
\q2 Who has seen such things?
\q1 Can a land be delivered through labor in one day?
\q2 Can a nation be born {in} one moment?
\q1 For Zion went into labor,
\q2 she yet gave birth to her children.

\q1
\v 9 Do I break open the womb
\q2 and not cause birth?”—said Yahweh.
\q1 “Or do I cause birth
\q2 and block {it}?”—said your God.

\q1
\v 10 “Rejoice with Jerusalem
\q2 and be glad for her, all who love her;
\q1 rejoice with her {in} gladness,
\q2 all who mourned over her!
\q1
\v 11 For you will suckle and be satisfied
\q2 from her comforting breasts;
\q1 for you will drink deep and be refreshed
\q2 from her glorious teat.”

\ts\*
\m
\v 12 For thus says Yahweh:
\q1 “Behold, I am about to spread well-being over her like a river,
\q2 and like an overflowing stream the splendor of the nations,
\q1 and you will suckle; at {her} side you will be carried
\q2 and on her knees rocked to and fro.
\q1
\v 13 As a man whose mother comforts him,
\q2 so I will comfort you,
\q2 and in Jerusalem you will be comforted.”

\ts\*
\b
\q1
\v 14 And you will see, and your heart will rejoice,
\q2 and your bones will sprout like the grass,
\q1 and the hand of Yahweh will be made known to his servants,
\q2 but he will rage {against} his enemies.

\q1
\v 15 For behold, Yahweh is coming with fire,
\q2 and like the windstorm, his chariots
\q1 to bring the heat of his nose
\q2 and his rebuke with flames of fire.
\q1
\v 16 For Yahweh judges with fire,
\q2 and with his sword against all flesh.
\q2 and those slain by Yahweh will be many.

\ts\*
\m
\v 17 “Those who consecrate and purify themselves to {enter} the gardens, behind one in the center, eating the flesh of pig and abominations and mice. They altogether will come to an end”—the declaration of Yahweh.

\ts\*
\p
\v 18 “For I {know} their deeds and their thoughts. {The time} is coming when I will gather all nations and tongues, and they will come and see my glory.
\v 19 And I will set a sign among them and send survivors from them to the nations: Tarshish, Pul and Lud, who draw the bow, Tubal and Javan, the distant coastlands where they have not heard news of me and have not seen my glory; and they will proclaim my glory among the nations.
\v 20 And they will bring all your brothers from all the nations {as} an offering to Yahweh on horses and in chariots and in wagons and on mules and on camels to my holy mountain Jerusalem”—says Yahweh—“as the sons of Israel bring a grain offering in a clean vessel {into} the house of Yahweh.
\ts\*
\p
\v 21 And from them I shall even take priests {and} Levites”—says Yahweh.
\ts\*
\q1
\v 22 “For just as the new heavens and the new earth
\q2 that I am making stand before my face”—the declaration of Yahweh—
\q2 “so will stand your seed and your name.
\v 23 And it will be, from month to month, and from Sabbath to Sabbath,
\q2 all flesh will come to bow down before my face”—says Yahweh.

\q1
\v 24 “And they will go out and see
\q2 the corpses of the men who have rebelled against me,
\q1 for their maggots will not die, and their fire will not be quenched;
\q2 and they will be an abhorrence to all flesh.”
