# family, household

## Definition:

The term “family” refers to a group of people who are related by blood and usually includes a father, mother, and their children. In the Bible, this term sometimes includes other close relatives such as grandparents, grandchildren, uncles and aunts.

* In biblical times, usually the oldest man was the major authority of a family.
* Family could also include servants, concubines, and even foreigners.
* Some languages may have a broader word such as “clan” or “household” that would fit better in contexts where more than just parents and children are being referred to.
* The New Testament often uses terms related to the concept of “family” to refer to the Church, meaning people who believe in Jesus.
