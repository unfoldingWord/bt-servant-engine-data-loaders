# rule, reign, ruler, prefect, official, leader

## Definition:

The term “ruler” is a general reference to a person who has authority over other people, such as a leader of a country, kingdom, or religious group. A ruler is one who “rules,” and his authority is his “rule.”

* In the Old Testament, a king was sometimes referred to generally as a “ruler,” as in the phrase “appointed him ruler over Israel.”
* God was referred to as the ultimate ruler, who rules over all other rulers.
* In the New Testament, the leader of a synagogue was called a “ruler.”
* Another type of ruler in the New Testament was a “governor.”
* Depending on the context, “ruler” could be translated as “leader” or “person who has authority over.”
* The action to “rule” means to “lead” to “have authority over.” It means the same thing as “reign” when it refers to the ruling of a king.
