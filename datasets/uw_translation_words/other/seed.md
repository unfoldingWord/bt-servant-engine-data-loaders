# seed

## Definition:

A “seed” is the part of a plant that gets planted in the ground to reproduce more of the same kind of plant. 

* The term “seed” can also refer to what a man plants into a woman that allows them to reproduce. 
* Related to this, “seed” is also used to refer to a man‘s or woman‘s offspring or descendants.
* This word often has a plural meaning, referring to more than one seed grain or more than one descendant.
* In the parable of the farmer planting seeds, Jesus compared his seeds to the Word of God, which is planted in people’s hearts in order to produce good spiritual fruit.
* The apostle Paul also uses the term “seed” to refer to the Word of God.

## Translation Suggestions:

* For the seed of a plant, use a general term that can apply to all plants, if possible. 
* When “seed” refers to people who are of the same family line, it may be more clear to use the word “descendant” or “descendants” instead of “seed.” Some languages may have a word that means “children and grandchildren.”
* For a man or woman’s “seed,” consider how the target expresses this in a way that will not offend or embarrass people.
