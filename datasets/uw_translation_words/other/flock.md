# flock, herd

## Definition:

In the Bible, “flock” refers to a group of sheep or goats and “herd” refers to a group of cattle or pigs.

* Different languages may have different ways of naming groups of animals or birds.

## Translation Suggestions

* Consider what terms are used in your language to refer to different groups of animals, and use the appropriate term for each kind of animal.
* If your language uses the same word to refer to both groups of sheep and cattle, then you may need to say “groups of sheep” where the Bible says only “flocks,” and “groups of cattle” where the Bible says only “herds.” Alternatively, if the Biblical context does not demand differentiation (if the text simply says “flocks and herds,” meaning all their domesticated animals) you may just use the one word once.
