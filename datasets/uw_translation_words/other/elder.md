# elder

## Definition:

The term “elder” refers to people (in the Bible, usually men) who have grown old enough to become mature adults and leaders within a community and to be respected for their wisdom and experience. 

*   The term “elder” came from the fact that elders were originally older men who, because of their age and experience, had greater wisdom.
*   In the Old Testament, the elders helped lead the Israelites in matters of justice and the Law of Moses.
*   In the New Testament, Jewish “elders” continued to be leaders in their communities and also were judges for the people.
*   In the early Christian churches, Christian “elders” gave spiritual leadership to the local assemblies of believers. Elders in these churches sometimes included young men who were spiritually mature.
*   This term could be translated as “respected leaders” or “spiritually mature men leading the church.”
