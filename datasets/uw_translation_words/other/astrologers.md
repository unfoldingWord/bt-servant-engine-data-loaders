# astrologers

## Definition:

“Astrologers” are people who study the stars because they believe that the movements and positions of the stars can tell us things about events that are going to happen on earth.

* In the ancient kingdoms in Bible times, kings would employ wise men to tell them about the future. Especially in Eastern kingdoms such as Babylon, kings would have astrologers in their courts to interpret the stars for them.
* In Matthew’s account of the birth of Christ, the “learned” or “wise” men who brought gifts to Jesus in Bethlehem sometime after his birth there were probably astrologers. 
* They may have been descendants of the wise men who served the Babylonian kings in Daniel’s time and who were trained in many things, including studying the stars and interpreting dreams.
