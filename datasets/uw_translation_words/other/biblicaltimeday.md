# day

## Definition:

The term “day” generally refers to the time it takes for the alternating periods of light and darkness in the sky to complete one cycle (that is, 24 hours). However, in the Bible the same term is often used to refer to a shorter period of time (such as the time between sunrise and sunset) or a longer period of time that is often not specified.

* “Day” is sometimes used in contrast to “night.” In these cases, the term refers to the period of time when the sky is light.
* The term may also refer to a specific point in time, such as “today.”
* Sometimes the term “day” is used figuratively to refer to a longer period of time, such as the “day of Yahweh” or “last days.” Some languages will use a different expression to translate these figurative uses or will translate “day” non-figuratively.

## Translation Suggestions:

* It is best to translate this term literally as “day” or “daytime” using the word in your language that refers to the part of the day when there is light.
* Other translations of “day” could include “daytime,” “time,” “season,” “occasion” or “event,” depending on the context.
