# Nephils, Nephilim, Nephilites

## Facts:

The term “Nephils” is the name for a group of people who is mentioned in two passages in the Bible. Once in Genesis 6:4, before the flood, and twice in Numbers 13:33, after the flood. The “Nephils” are called “Nephilim” or “Nephilites.” The Nephils were a physically large people that had a reputation for being mighty warriors.

English translations have chosen to either transliterate the original language (Hebrew) word as “Nephilim” or transliterate the first part of the word "Nephil" and then add the English plural ending “ites” resulting in “Nephilites.” You may desire to do translisterate this term in your translation as well.
