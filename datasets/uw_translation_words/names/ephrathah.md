# Ephrath, Ephrathah

## Facts:

The name “Ephrathah” refers to a clan of Judah as well as to the territory that they occupied, which was centered around the town of Bethlehem. Sometimes the name is shortened to “Ephrath.”

* The clan of Ephrathah was probably named after a woman named “Ephrathah,” who was a wife of Caleb and the grandmother of the founders of the towns of Kiriath Jearim, Bethlehem, and Beth Gader (1 Chron 2:50-51).
* The towns of Bethlehem (Gen 35:19;48:7) and Kirjath Jearim (Psalm 132:6) are both sometimes referred to as “Ephrathah.”
* Rachel died on the way to a town called “Ephrathah.”
* It is possible that there was a different town called “Ephrathah” further north near Ramah, and that Rachel was buried near there (1 Sam 10:2; Jer 31:15).
