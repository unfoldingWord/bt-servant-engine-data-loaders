front:intro	f68r				0	# Introduction to Ruth\n\n## Part 1: General Introduction\n\n### Outline of Ruth\n\n1. Naomi goes to Moab with her family ([1:1–5](../01/01.md))\n1. Ruth comes to Bethlehem with Naomi ([1:6–22](../01/06.md))\n1. Boaz helps Ruth as she gleans ([2:1–23](../02/01.md))\n1. Boaz and Ruth at the threshing floor ([3:1–18](../03/01.md))\n1. Ruth becomes the wife of Boaz ([4:1–16](../04/01.md))\n1. Obed born to Ruth and Boaz; the genealogy of David ([4:13–22](../04/13.md))\n\n### What is the book of Ruth about?\n\nThis book is about a non-Israelite woman named Ruth. It tells how she came to join the people of Yahweh. The book also explains how Ruth became an ancestor of King David.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nThis book traditionally has the title **Ruth** because she is the main person in it. If the church prefers, you could use a fuller title such as **The Book About Ruth**. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n### When did the events in the book of Ruth occur?\n\nThe story of Ruth is set during the time when there were judges in Israel. This was after the people of Israel had entered into the land of Canaan, but before they had a king. The judges were men and women whom God chose to help the Israelites defeat their enemies. These leaders usually continued to help the people by deciding disputes among them. They also helped the people make important decisions. Many of these leaders served all the people of Israel, but some of them may have served only certain tribes.\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### Why does Scripture include a book about a woman from the foreign land of Moab?\n\nIn a period when Israel was often unfaithful to Yahweh, a woman from Moab showed great faith in him. The Israelites’ frequent lack of faith in Yahweh is contrasted with the faith of this woman from a foreign land. This shows us that God is the God of all people, not just of Israel. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faithful]])\n\n### What important marriage custom is found in the book of Ruth?\n\nIsraelites practiced what is called “levirate marriage.” In this custom, the closest male relative of a man who died without any children was obligated to provide for his widow by marrying her. Usually this would be one of the man’s brothers. Any children born to them were to be regarded as children of the dead man. They did this so that the dead man would have descendants. If the closest relative did not marry the woman, another relative could fulfill this obligation.\n\n### What was a “kinsman-redeemer”?\n\nA person’s close relative or relatives were expected to act as “kinsmen-redeemers” ([2:20](../02/20.md) ULT) for him or her. They were responsible to provide for a relative in need, fulfill obligations of levirate marriage, and buy back land into the family that had been sold to someone outside of the family. In the book of Ruth, Boaz is one such kinsman-redeemer.\n\n### What was “gleaning” in the book of Ruth?\n\nIn Israel, poor people were allowed to follow after the men who harvested a field. These gleaners picked up stalks of grain that the harvesters missed or dropped. In this way, poor people were able to find some food. Ruth became a gleaner in a field belonging to Boaz.\n\n### What is covenant faithfulness or covenant loyalty?\n\nA covenant is a formal, binding agreement between two parties that one or both parties must fulfill. Covenant faithfulness or covenant loyalty is when a person does what they said they would do according to the covenant that they had made. God made a covenant with Israel in which he promised that he would love and be faithful to the Israelites. The Israelites were to do the same toward him and toward each other.\n\nThe book of Ruth shows that what kinsmen-redeemers do for their relatives is part of Israel’s duties according to God’s covenant with them. The story of Boaz, Ruth, and Naomi gives examples to all of Israel of the good effects of covenant faithfulness. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenantfaith]])\n\n### What function did city gates have in the ancient Near East?\n\nCity gates in the time of Boaz were meeting places for the city elders. Elders were honored men who decided business matters and legal matters together. The city walls were thick, especially at the entryways, and the gates had guard towers beside and above them. Therefore, the gateway opening provided a large shady area for public meetings and there were places for important people to sit. For this reason, Boaz and the other elders sat in the gateway.\n\nSome English Bible versions speak of Boaz sitting at the city gate, but it may be best for translators to make clear that Boaz sat in the city gateway.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### How does the book of Ruth change from one topic to another topic?\n\nThe book of Ruth often changes to new topics or new parts of the story. The ULT uses various words to indicate these changes, such as “so,” “then,” and “now.” Translators should use the ways most natural in their own languages to signal these changes.
1:intro	irf4				0	# Ruth 1 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n### **It happened in the days when the judges ruled**\n\nThe events of this book occur during the period of Judges. The book is concurrent with the book of Judges. To understand the historical context of the book, the translator may wish to review the book of Judges.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Women without a husband or children\n\nIn the ancient Near East, if a woman lacked a husband or sons, she was considered to be in a dire circumstance. She would not have been able to provide for herself. This is why Naomi told her daughters to remarry.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Contrast\n\nThe actions of Ruth the Moabite are intended to contrast with the actions of Naomi the Jew. Ruth shows great faith in Naomi’s God, while Naomi does not trust in Yahweh. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/trust]])

1:9	v2vx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בֵּ֣ית אִישָׁ֑⁠הּ	1	This means with new husbands, not with their previous husbands, who died, or with someone else’s husband.

See the book introduction for more explanation. If it would be helpful, you could put some of this information in a footnote.
1:13	gh99		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מַר־לִ֤⁠י מְאֹד֙	1	Here, bitterness is a metaphor for grief. Alternate translation: [it is a great grief for me]

If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, use an idiom from your language that does have that meaning or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [Then they wailed and wept loudly]
1:14	t4sl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠ר֖וּת דָּ֥בְקָה בָּֽ⁠הּ	1	This could mean: (1) Ruth refused to leave Naomi. Alternate translation: [but Ruth would not leave her] or (2) Ruth physically held on to Naomi and would not let go of her. Alternate translation: [but Ruth held on to her]
1:15	ld6g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הִנֵּה֙	1	Naomi is using the term **Behold** to focus Ruth’s attention on what she is about to say. Your language may have a comparable expression that you could use in your translation. Alternate translation: [Listen] or [You know]
1:15	nqm3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	יְבִמְתֵּ֔⁠ךְ	1	Naomi is using the phrase **your sister-in-law** to refer to Orpah, the widow of Ruth’s deceased husband’s brother.

1:15	i9wa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	עַמָּ֖⁠הּ	1	Here, Naomi is using the possessive form to describe the **people** to whom Orpah belongs.

1:15	man4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	אֱלֹהֶ֑י⁠הָ	1	Here, Naomi is using the possessive form to describe the **god** of the Moabites that Orpah and Ruth used to worship before they married Naomi’s sons and began to worship Yahweh. If your language would not use the possessive form to express the relationship between Orpah and this god, you could express this in another way. Alternate translation: [the god that they worship]
1:15	m9o6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	אֱלֹהֶ֑י⁠הָ	1	The word translated here as **god** is plural, but Hebrew quite commonly uses the plural when referring to a deity. Here it probably refers to the god of the Moabites named Chemosh, as it does in [1 Kings 11:33](../../1ki/11/33.md). If the Bible commonly used in your area uses a plural here, you may choose to do so too. Alternate translation: [her gods]
1:16	z5ug			וּ⁠בַ⁠אֲשֶׁ֤ר תָּלִ֨ינִי֙	1	Alternate translation: [and where you live]
1:16	wspu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	לְ⁠עָזְבֵ֖⁠ךְ לָ⁠שׁ֣וּב מֵ⁠אַחֲרָ֑יִ⁠ךְ	1	The phrase **turn back from behind you** further defines the phrase **forsake you**. Ruth is using the two phrases together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could use a single phrase and express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: [to forget my commitment to remain loyal to you]
1:16	b518		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	עַמֵּ֣⁠ךְ עַמִּ֔⁠י וֵ⁠אלֹהַ֖יִ⁠ךְ אֱלֹהָֽ⁠י	1	With these phrases, Ruth completely identifies herself with the culture and religion of Naomi, an Israelite. The original does not have any verbs, so if your language requires verbs here, choose the ones that best communicate this. Alternate translation: [Your people will be my people, and your God will be my God]
1:17	sje3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-oathformula	כֹּה֩ יַעֲשֶׂ֨ה יְהוָ֥ה לִ⁠י֙ וְ⁠כֹ֣ה יֹסִ֔יף	1	Ruth uses this oath formula to show that she is very committed to doing what she says. She calls down a curse on herself, asking God to punish her if she does not do what she has said she would do. In keeping with the custom, she did not express what that punishment would be. Use a natural way in your language to express an oath. Alternate translation: [May Yahweh strike me dead, and may he do more, and may he do even more]
1:17	abc2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	כִּ֣י הַ⁠מָּ֔וֶת יַפְרִ֖יד בֵּינִ֥⁠י וּ⁠בֵינֵֽ⁠ךְ	1	This could mean: (1) even death cannot overcome Ruth’s commitment to Naomi. This could be a form of hyperbole or simply a way to restate her commitment to be buried in the same place as Naomi is buried. Alternate translation: [if even death separates us from each other]; (2) the only thing that can separate Ruth from Naomi would be the death of one of them. Alternate translation: [if anything other than death separates us from each other] or [if I leave you while you and I are both still alive]
1:17	ab05		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	יַפְרִ֖יד בֵּינִ֥⁠י וּ⁠בֵינֵֽ⁠ךְ	1	This phrase is an idiom that means “separates you and me.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use an idiom from your language that does have this meaning or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [separates the two of us] or [comes between us]
1:18	rsq2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	וַ⁠תֶּחְדַּ֖ל לְ⁠דַבֵּ֥ר אֵלֶֽי⁠הָ	1	This phrase expresses the result of the previous phrase. You may want to indicate this by using a connector that introduces a result. Alternate translation: [so she refrained from speaking to her further]
1:18	xncr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns	וַ⁠תֶּחְדַּ֖ל לְ⁠דַבֵּ֥ר אֵלֶֽי⁠הָ	1	In this phrase, **she** refers to Naomi, and **her** refers to Ruth. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use their names here. Also, this does not mean that Naomi was angry with Ruth or that she no longer spoke to her at all. It only means that she stopped trying to persuade Ruth to leave her. Alternate translation: [so Naomi stopped trying to persuade Ruth]
1:19	j9wa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֗י	1	**And it happened** introduces a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. Alternate translation: [And it came about]
1:19	jdr1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	כְּ⁠בֹאָ֨⁠נָה֙ בֵּ֣ית לֶ֔חֶם	1	This phrase provides background information about their arrival to help readers understand what happens next in the story. In your translation, present this information in a way that makes it clear that this is background information. Alternate translation: [while Naomi and Ruth were still walking into Bethlehem]
1:19	y3us		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	כָּל־הָ⁠עִיר֙	1	Here, **town** represents the people who live there. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [everyone who lived there]
1:19	abc3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	כָּל־הָ⁠עִיר֙	1	The word **entire** here is a generalization for emphasis. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different way to express the emphasis.

1:19	xnb3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠זֹ֥את נָעֳמִֽי	1	The writer is using a rhetorical question to emphasize the reaction of the people to Naomi’s condition upon her return. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Because it had been many years since Naomi lived in Bethlehem and now she no longer has her husband and two sons, it is likely that the women were expressing shock that this woman was actually Naomi. Alternate translation: [This must be Naomi, but I do not see her family!]

Both **Yahweh** and **the Almighty** refer to God. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine the statements to show that the second statement is not saying a new thing. Alternate translation: [But as for Yahweh, the Almighty God, he has opposed me and treated me badly.]

2:intro	ld2v				0	# Ruth 2 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### “a man of great worth” ([2:1](../02/01.md))\n\nThis phrase describes Boaz as having good attributes, but in a very general way. The phrase could describe a man who is physically strong and able, wealthy, or of good, godly character, or all of those things. From the context of the story, we can see that Boaz has land, servants who respect him, and he lives in a way that honors God, so it seems that this phrase is describing his wealth and character. Think about how you would describe someone like this in your language.\n\n### “Do not go to glean in another field” ([2:8](../02/08.md))\n\nBoaz said this because he could not guarantee Ruth’s safety in another person’s field. It seems that not everyone was as gracious and obedient to the law of Moses as was Boaz. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/grace]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]])\n\n### “kinsman-redeemer” ([2:20](../02/20.md))\n\nA “kinsmen-redeemer” was a male relative who was responsible to provide for any close member of the same clan who was in need, fulfill obligations of levirate marriage, and buy back land into the family that had been sold to someone outside of the family. See the book introduction for more information.

3:intro	t4y5				0	# Ruth 3 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Boaz’s integrity\n\nBoaz showed great integrity in this chapter by not having sexual relations with Ruth until they were married. He was also concerned with preserving Ruth’s good reputation. Displaying Boaz’s good character is an important point in this chapter.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### **So that it may be well with you**\n\nNaomi wanted Ruth to have a secure home with a good husband who would care for her. She could see that Boaz would be the best husband for her. She also thought that Boaz, as a kinsman-redeemer, had an obligation to marry her. This could be true because, even though Ruth was a Gentile by birth, she had become part of Naomi’s family and part of the nation of Israel. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
3:1	jdr3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠תֹּ֥אמֶר לָ֖⁠הּ נָעֳמִ֣י חֲמוֹתָ֑⁠הּ	1	The writer is using the word translated **Then** to introduce the next part of the story, in which Ruth asks Boaz to perform the role of kinsman-redeemer for her and Naomi. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. Alternate translation: [After some time, Naomi, Ruth’s mother-in-law, said to her]
3:1	r7ar		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	חֲמוֹתָ֑⁠הּ	1	Naomi is the mother of Ruth’s dead husband, and thus, is Ruth’s **mother-in-law**. Alternate translation: [the mother of Ruth’s dead husband]
3:1	ry8p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	נָעֳמִ֣י חֲמוֹתָ֑⁠הּ	1	**Naomi** is Ruth’s **mother-in-law**.

Use a form of address in your language that shows that Naomi loves Ruth as she would love a daughter. Alternate translation: [My dear one]
3:1	nxr8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠לֹ֧א אֲבַקֶּשׁ־לָ֛⁠ךְ מָנ֖וֹחַ אֲשֶׁ֥ר יִֽיטַב־לָֽ⁠ךְ	1	Naomi is using the question form to cause Ruth to think of her future. Here, Naomi uses this question to tell Ruth what she plans to do. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: [I must look for a place for you to rest, in a place that will be good for you.] or [I must find a husband to care for you, who will be good to you.]
3:1	uw2p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מָנ֖וֹחַ	1	Here, Naomi is speaking of a permanent home as **a resting place**. This does not mean a place to rest temporarily from being tired. It means a place of permanent comfort and security in a good home with a husband. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [a permanent home] or [a husband]
3:2	jdr4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	וְ⁠עַתָּ֗ה	1	Naomi’s rhetorical question in [3:1](../03/01.md) gave the reason for the plan that she is about to tell to Ruth in verses [3:2–4](../03/02.md). Use a connector in your language that marks what follows as a planned result of what was said before. Alternate translation: [Because of that, I have been thinking.]
3:2	b4h8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠לֹ֥א בֹ֨עַז֙ מֹֽדַעְתָּ֔⁠נוּ אֲשֶׁ֥ר הָיִ֖ית אֶת־נַעֲרוֹתָ֑י⁠ו	1	Naomi uses the question form here to remind Ruth of something she had already told her (See [2:20](../02/20.md)).

3:2	j31t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֲשֶׁ֥ר הָיִ֖ית אֶת־נַעֲרוֹתָ֑י⁠ו	1	The implication is that Boaz owned the fields where Ruth worked together with these young women, not that Boaz owned the young women. You could clarify this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [the one who owns the fields where you have been working with the other female workers]
3:2	nd8v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הִנֵּה	1	Naomi is using the term **Behold** to focus Ruth’s attention on what she is about to say. Your language may have a comparable expression that you could use in your translation. Alternate translation: [Look]
3:3	ru6z			וָ⁠סַ֗כְתְּ	1	Alternate translation: [rub sweet-smelling oil on yourself]
3:3	e92h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	וְיָרַ֣דְתְּ הַ⁠גֹּ֑רֶן	1	A **threshing floor** is an open, flat area where workers could thresh and winnow grain. It would be outside of the city, which was high on a hill, and thus, one would go “down” to it. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of agricultural site, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: [and leave the city to go to the flat place where he will thresh and winnow his grain]
3:3	m6zw		figs-extrainfo	לֶ⁠אֱכֹ֥ל וְ⁠לִ⁠שְׁתּֽוֹת	1	If it would be unnatural to express these details of a meal in your language, you could use a more natural phrase. Alternate translation: [his supper]
3:4	jdr5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	וִ⁠יהִ֣י	1	The phrase **And let it be** introduces the next series of specific instructions that Naomi is about to give to Ruth. Use a form in your language that introduces a series of instructions, or omit the phrase if your language does not do this. Use a colon to replace the comma. Alternate translation: [Do this:]
3:4	ln1m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וְ⁠גִלִּ֥ית מַרְגְּלֹתָ֖י⁠ו	1	To **uncover his feet** means to remove the cloak or blanket covering his feet, and probably also his legs. This action by a woman was probably a symbolic action that was interpreted as a proposal of marriage. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could include this information in a footnote.
3:4	zi01		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	מַרְגְּלֹתָ֖י⁠ו	1	The word translated **feet** could be used as a euphemism for a man’s private parts, but here it refers to the man’s feet or legs. If your language has a word that works in this way, you can use it here. Otherwise, use a word for “feet” or “legs” and consider putting this information in a footnote.
3:4	w1u5			וְ⁠הוּא֙ יַגִּ֣יד לָ֔⁠ךְ אֵ֖ת אֲשֶׁ֥ר תַּעַשִֽׂי⁠ן	1	The specific custom of that time is unclear, but Naomi appears to believe that Boaz will understand Ruth’s action as a proposal of marriage. Boaz will then either accept or reject her offer. If it would be helpful, you could include this information in a footnote.
3:4	nn4g		figs-rpronouns	וְ⁠הוּא֙ יַגִּ֣יד	1	Here, the word **himself** emphasizes that Boaz will decide what happens next, not Naomi or Ruth. Use a way that is natural in your language to indicate this significance. Alternate translation: [Then it will be Boaz who will tell]
3:6	ab22		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	וַ⁠תַּ֕עַשׂ כְּ⁠כֹ֥ל אֲשֶׁר־צִוַּ֖תָּ⁠ה חֲמוֹתָֽ⁠הּ	1	This statement summarizes the actions that Ruth will do in [3:7](../03/07.md). If people misunderstand from this that Ruth did these actions in [3:6](../03/06.md) and then did them again in [3:7](../03/07.md), then you could translate this sentence as **and she obeyed her mother-in-law**. Or if it would make the order of events more clear, you could move this sentence to the end of [3:7](../03/07.md), then combine the verse numbers as a verse bridge (6–7).
3:7	fz7e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יִּיטַ֣ב לִבּ֔⁠וֹ	1	Here **heart** stands for “emotions” or “disposition.” Boaz’s emotions or feelings were good. This does not imply that Boaz was drunk. Alternate translation: [and he felt good] or [and he was in a good mood]
3:7	y6gk			וַ⁠תָּבֹ֣א בַ⁠לָּ֔ט	1	Alternate translation: [Then she sneaked in] or [Then she came in so quietly that no one could hear her]
3:7	eq2u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	וַ⁠תְּגַ֥ל מַרְגְּלֹתָ֖י⁠ו	1	See how you translated **feet** in [3:4](../03/04.md). Alternate translation: [and removed the covering from his legs]

3:8	xun6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וַ⁠יֶּחֱרַ֥ד הָ⁠אִ֖ישׁ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. It is not clear what startled Boaz. Perhaps he suddenly felt the cold air on his feet or legs. Alternate translation: [the man startled]
3:8	ab23		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	וְ⁠הִנֵּ֣ה	1	Here the word **behold** shows that what follows was very surprising to Boaz. Use your language’s way of expressing surprise. Alternate translation: [And much to his surprise]
3:9	wj9e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	אֲמָתֶ֔⁠ךָ & אֲמָ֣תְ⁠ךָ֔	1	Ruth was not one of Boaz’s servants, but she referred to herself as Boaz’s servant as a polite way to express respect to Boaz. Use your language’s way of expressing humility and respect. Alternate translation: [your humble handmaid] … “your humble handmaid”
3:9	xp1b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וּ⁠פָרַשְׂתָּ֤ כְנָפֶ֨⁠ךָ֙ עַל־אֲמָ֣תְ⁠ךָ֔	1	This was a cultural idiom for marriage. Alternate translation: [Please marry me]
3:9	l5g4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	גֹאֵ֖ל	1	See how you translated this term in [2:20](../02/20.md).

3:10	qxnp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בִּתִּ֔⁠י	1	See how you translated **my daughter** in [2:8](../02/08.md). Boaz uses this phrase again here to communicate kindness and respect from a man to a younger woman. Use an appropriate phrase in your language. Alternate translation: [little one]
3:10	bjw9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הֵיטַ֛בְתְּ חַסְדֵּ֥⁠ךְ הָ⁠אַחֲר֖וֹן מִן־הָ⁠רִאשׁ֑וֹן	1	By marrying Naomi’s relative who is a kinsman-redeemer, Ruth would also provide for Naomi, honor Naomi’s son, and continue Naomi’s family line. Boaz considers this to be Ruth’s greatest demonstration of faithfulness to Naomi. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could put this information in a footnote. Alternate translation: [You are demonstrating even more loving kindness now than before]
3:10	cbd3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הָ⁠רִאשׁ֑וֹן	1	Boaz is using the phrase **at the beginning** to refer to the way that Ruth had earlier provided for her mother-in-law by staying with her and gleaning grain for food for both of them. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [when you first came here with Naomi]
3:10	n84d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לְ⁠בִלְתִּי־לֶ֗כֶת אַחֲרֵי֙	1	Boaz is praising Ruth for **not going after* the young men, by which he means that Ruth could have ignored Naomi’s need and looked for a young and handsome husband for herself outside of Elimelek’s relatives, but she did not. Alternate translation: [because you have not looked for marriage among]
3:11	jdr6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	וְ⁠עַתָּ֗ה	1	**So now** indicates that what came before in verse [3:10](../03/10.md) is the reason for what follows here in [verse 11](../03/11.md). Use a natural connector for introducing a result. Alternate translation: [Therefore]
3:11	ei93		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בִּתִּ⁠י֙	1	See how you translated this in [2:8](../02/08.md) and [3:10](../03/10.md). Boaz uses this expression as a sign of kindness and respect toward Ruth as a younger woman. Use the form of address that would be appropriate in your language.
3:11	ab08		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	כָּל־שַׁ֣עַר עַמִּ֔⁠י	1	Here, **gate** represents the people who gather at the gate. The gate was an area of the city where people gathered to do business, and the leaders met there to make decisions.

3:12	jdr7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וְ⁠עַתָּה֙	1	The phrase **And now** indicates that what follows is something else important that Ruth should pay attention to, as well as what Boaz introduced by saying “So now” in [3:11](../03/11.md). Alternate translation: [Another thing you must know]
3:12	ab30		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וְ⁠גַ֛ם	1	The connector **but** indicates a contrast between Boaz’s willingness to marry Ruth [3:11](../03/11.md) and the possibility of another man marrying her instead [3:12](../03/12.md). The contrast can be indicated here or at the beginning of the verse, as in the UST. Alternate translation: [even so] or [nonetheless]
3:12	fvq5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	גֹאֵ֖ל & גֹּאֵ֖ל	1	See how you translated **kinsman-redeemer** in [2:20](../02/20.md). This term refers to the male relative who was closest in family relationship to a man who died and who had the responsibility to help his widow.
3:13	gcl8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אִם־יִגְאָלֵ֥⁠ךְ	1	The implication of the word **redeem** is that in this culture it means “marry according to our custom concerning widows.” Boaz is referring to the expectation that the closest male relative of Ruth’s dead husband would marry her and raise a son to carry on the dead man’s family name. You could include some of this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [if he will take care of you] or [if he will redeem you, that is, marry you]
3:13	w8g2		figs-rpronouns	וּ⁠גְאַלְתִּ֥י⁠ךְ אָנֹ֖כִי	1	Boaz uses the word **myself** to emphasize that he was committed to taking care of Ruth. Use a way that is natural in your language to indicate this emphasis. Alternate translation: [then I will certainly redeem you]
3:13	tkz9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-oathformula	חַי־יְהוָ֑ה	1	The phrase **as Yahweh lives** is an oath formula. This was a common Hebrew vow that obligated the speaker to perform what he said. Use a natural way in your language to express an oath. Alternate translation: [as surely as Yahweh lives] or [I swear by the life of Yahweh]
3:14	vn8p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠תִּשְׁכַּ֤ב מַרְגְּלוֹתָיו֙	1	The implication of **So she lay at his feet** is that although Ruth and Boaz were alone together all night, they did not sin sexually. You can include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [Ruth slept at the feet of Boaz]
3:14	dwx1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בְּטֶ֛רֶם יַכִּ֥יר אִ֖ישׁ אֶת־רֵעֵ֑⁠הוּ	1	The idiom **before a man could recognize his friend** means that it was very early in the morning, before there was enough light to recognize the face of a familiar person. If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use an idiom from your language that does have that meaning or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [before you could see your hand in front of your face] or [while it was still quite dark]
3:14	q9ix		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר֙	1	Boaz probably said this before Ruth lay down to sleep. If it would be helpful in your language, you could move this to the beginning of the verse, as in the UST, or indicate that this happened before Ruth lay down. Alternate translation: [She did this because Boaz had said]
3:14	qgjv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	אַל־יִוָּדַ֔ע	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [Do not let anyone know]
3:15	hj1e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	הַ⁠מִּטְפַּ֧חַת	1	A **cloak** was a long, thick outer garment usually made of cloth. Your language and culture may have a term for such a piece of clothing that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: [the cape] or [the coat]
3:15	f5zg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	שֵׁשׁ־שְׂעֹרִים֙	1	The actual amount is not stated. There is no word referring to the container that Boaz filled six times with barley. The original readers probably knew how big this container was, but we do not. The total amount was enough to be considered generous, yet not too much for Ruth to carry alone. Most scholars think that the total amount was around 25 to 30 kilograms. Alternate translation: [six measures of barley]
3:15	gdn8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וַ⁠יָּ֣שֶׁת עָלֶ֔י⁠הָ	1	The writer is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You could supply these words if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: [into it and then put the cloak full of barley on Ruth’s back]
3:15	aj7u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	וַ⁠יָּבֹ֖א הָ⁠עִֽיר	1	Many ancient manuscripts read **he went**, referring to Boaz. The ULT follows that reading. Other ancient manuscripts read “she went,” referring to Ruth. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
3:16	s7dr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מִי־אַ֣תְּ	1	Naomi’s question to Ruth, **“Who are you, my daughter?”** appears to be an idiom that probably asks about her current status. In other words, it is likely that Naomi is asking if Ruth is now betrothed to be married. Alternate translation: [How is it with you] or [How did it go for you]
3:16	ab34		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	בִּתִּ֑⁠י	1	Ruth is actually Naomi’s daughter-in-law, but Naomi calls her **my daughter** as an endearment. Use an appropriate endearment in your language, if there is one. Alternate translation: [my dear one] or [my daughter-in-law]
3:16	w9p9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֵ֛ת כָּל־אֲשֶׁ֥ר עָֽשָׂה־לָ֖⁠הּ הָ⁠אִֽישׁ	1	Most of what **the man had done for her** was verbal. That is, the main thing was that Boaz promised Ruth that he would make sure that she and Naomi were taken care of. If it would be helpful in your language, you could indicate that what Boaz did included the things that he said to her. Alternate translation: [everything that the man had promised to do for her]
3:17	abca		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	שֵׁשׁ־הַ⁠שְּׂעֹרִ֥ים	1	See how you translated this in [3:15](../03/15.md). Alternate translation: [six measures of barley]

Alternate translation: [saying to me that I should not go empty to my mother-in-law]
3:17	e9xx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אַל־תָּב֥וֹאִי רֵיקָ֖ם	1	To **go empty** is an idiom that means to go to someone with nothing to offer that person. Alternate translation: [You must not go empty-handed] or [Do not go with nothing] or [You must take something]
3:18	ab36		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	שְׁבִ֣י	1	Here, **Sit** is an idiom that means to wait patiently and calmly. If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use an idiom from your language that does have this meaning or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [Stay quiet] or [Be patient]
3:18	ab35		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	בִתִּ֔⁠י	1	See how you translated this in [1:11–13](../01/11.md); [2:2](../02/02.md), [2:8](../02/08.md), [2:22](../02/22.md); [3:1](../03/01.md), [3:10](../03/10.md), [3:11](../03/11.md), [3:16](../03/16.md).

4:intro	pz6m				0	# Ruth 4 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### King David\n\nDespite being a Moabitess, Ruth became an ancestress of David. David was Israel’s greatest king. It may be surprising that a Gentile would become a part of such an important lineage, but it reminds us that God loves all people. Ruth had great faith in Yahweh. This shows us that God welcomes all who trust in him.\n\n### “You also acquire Ruth the Moabite woman”\n\nWith the privilege of using the family’s land came the responsibility to take care of the widows of the family. Therefore, the relative who wanted to use Naomi’s land had to also help Ruth to have a son who would carry on the family name and inheritance and provide for her.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### “In earlier times in Israel”\n\nVerse seven of chapter four is a comment made by the writer of the text. This indicates that there was a considerable period of time between the events that occurred and the time when they were written down, during which customs had changed. Consider how to indicate that this is a comment about the story rather than a part of the story.
4:1	jdr8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וּ⁠בֹ֨עַז עָלָ֣ה הַ⁠שַּׁעַר֮	1	The writer is using this clause to introduce the next part of the story, in which Boaz takes the leading role as kinsman-redeemer and marries Ruth. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. Alternate translation: [As for Boaz, he went up to the town gate]
4:1	m4by		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הַ⁠שַּׁעַר֮	1	The original readers knew that **the gate** was the place inside the entrance to the town where community business was publicly conducted. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [to the gathering place inside the gateway of the town]
4:1	jdr9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠הִנֵּ֨ה	1	The writer is using the term **behold** to focus our attention on the important event of Boaz seeing the exact person whom he wanted to see walking by. Your language may have a comparable expression that you could use in your translation. Alternate translation: [And amazingly] or [To his delight]
4:1	kz1g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	הַ⁠גֹּאֵ֤ל	1	The term **kinsman-redeemer** specifically refers to the closest living male relative to Elimelek. If your language has a specific word for such a person, it would be appropriate to use it here. See how you translated **kinsman-redeemer** in [2:20](../02/20.md).
4:1	ab39		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֛אמֶר ס֥וּרָ⁠ה שְׁבָ⁠ה־פֹּ֖ה פְּלֹנִ֣י אַלְמֹנִ֑י	1	In many languages, **a certain person** is an awkward and unnatural way for someone to address another person. A way to make this more natural could be to turn this into an indirect quotation. A combination of indirect and direct quotation is also possible, as in the UST. Alternate translation: [Boaz called to this certain person and asked him to turn aside and sit down there]
4:1	ab38		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	פְּלֹנִ֣י אַלְמֹנִ֑י	1	Boaz did not actually say **a certain person**; instead, he called the kinsman-redeemer by his name. This is an idiom that means a specific person, but the name is not given. The narrator has substituted this general term for the person’s name either because he did not want to give the specific name or because the man’s name had been forgotten. If your language has an idiom to refer to a specific person without using his name, use that here. Alternate translation: [so-and-so] or [such a one]
4:2	ab40			וַ⁠יִּקַּ֞ח עֲשָׂרָ֧ה אֲנָשִׁ֛ים	1	Alternate translation: [Then he chose ten men]
4:3	es9g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	לְ⁠אָחִ֖י⁠נוּ	1	Here the term **brother** is used in the broad sense to mean a male relative of an extended family. If your language has a word for this, it would be appropriate to use it here.
4:4	bvvo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אָמַ֜רְתִּי	1	Here, **said** refers to something that Boaz said to himself in his own mind. Alternate translation: [I said to myself that] or [I felt that]

Alternate translation: [I should inform you]
4:4	c6xi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	נֶ֥גֶד הַֽ⁠יֹּשְׁבִים֮	1	Having these men as witnesses would make the transaction legal and binding. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [before these witnesses]
4:4	lgq1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אִם־תִּגְאַל֙	1	Here, Boaz is asking about the man’s willingness to redeem the property. Use a natural way to express this in your language. Alternate translation: [If you are willing to buy it back to keep it in the family]
4:4	ab42		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions	אֵ֤ין זוּלָֽתְ⁠ךָ֙ לִ⁠גְא֔וֹל וְ⁠אָנֹכִ֖י אַחֲרֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1	In some languages, it may be confusing to say these things together: (1) there is no one to redeem the land besides you, (2) I can redeem the land after you. It may appear that Boaz is making a statement and then contradicting it. If so, you could say this differently. Alternate translation: [you are the first in line to redeem it, and I am the next one in line]
4:4	r8no		figs-rpronouns	אָנֹכִ֥י אֶגְאָֽל	1	The man uses the word **myself** here to emphasize that he will do it and no one else. Use a way that is natural in your language to indicate this significance. Alternate translation: [I will be the one who redeems it]
4:5	zifq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בְּ⁠יוֹם	1	Here, **On the day** is an idiom that means “at the time.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use an idiom from your language that does have this meaning or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [At the hour] or [At the same time]
4:5	ymn8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	מִ⁠יַּ֣ד נָעֳמִ֑י	1	Boaz is using one part of a person, the **hand of Naomi**, to represent Naomi herself and her legal possession of the land. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [from Naomi]

4:5	b3sy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לְ⁠הָקִ֥ים שֵׁם־הַ⁠מֵּ֖ת עַל־נַחֲלָתֽ⁠וֹ	1	Here, **raise up the name of the dead over** is an idiom that means “supply an heir for.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use an idiom from your language that does have this meaning or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [so that she may give birth to a son to inherit the property and carry on her dead husband’s family name]
4:5	ab43		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	הַ⁠מֵּת֙ & הַ⁠מֵּ֖ת	1	Boaz is using the adjective **dead** as a noun to mean the one who died. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: [the man who died … the dead man]
4:6	sx9k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אַשְׁחִ֖ית אֶת־נַחֲלָתִ֑⁠י	1	Here, **I damage my own inheritance** means that if the man marries Ruth, the property that he buys would belong to her son, not to his own children. In that way, he would be taking away from the wealth that his own children would inherit from him and giving it instead to the children that Ruth might bear. Alternate translation: [lest I take away from my own children’s inheritance.]
4:6	sa7h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	גְּאַל־לְ⁠ךָ֤ אַתָּה֙ אֶת־גְּאֻלָּתִ֔⁠י	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the ideas of **right** or **redemption**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: [I will allow you to redeem the property for yourself]
4:7	wga9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וְ⁠זֹאת֩	1	The word **Now** marks what follows as background information that the writer wants the reader to know in order to understand the story. Use your language’s way of giving background information in a story. Alternate translation: [You need to know this:]
4:7	i30y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠זֹאת֩	1	Here some words are left out that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You could supply these words if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: [Now this was the custom]
4:7	lgf5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	לְ⁠פָנִ֨ים	1	The word **formerly** implies that this custom was no longer practiced when the book of Ruth was written. Use a word or phrase that has this meaning. Alternate translation: [in earlier times]
4:7	d46w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לְ⁠רֵעֵ֑⁠הוּ	1	The words **to his friend** refer to the person with whom a man was making the agreement. Alternate translation: [to the counterparty] or [to the man with whom he was making an agreement]
4:8	royi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יֹּ֧אמֶר הַ⁠גֹּאֵ֛ל לְ⁠בֹ֖עַז קְנֵה־לָ֑⁠ךְ וַ⁠יִּשְׁלֹ֖ף נַעֲלֽ⁠וֹ	1	The events of the story start again here after the background information of [verse 7](../04/07.md). Use your language’s way of starting to tell the events of the story again.
4:8	ab44		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	וַ⁠יֹּ֧אמֶר הַ⁠גֹּאֵ֛ל לְ⁠בֹ֖עַז קְנֵה־לָ֑⁠ךְ וַ⁠יִּשְׁלֹ֖ף נַעֲלֽ⁠וֹ	1	The word **So** at the beginning of this verse indicates that this event happened because of the custom described in the previous verse. If it would be clearer in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases. Alternate translation: [So the kinsman-redeemer took off his sandal and said to Boaz, “Buy it for yourself”]
4:8	nvpp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יִּשְׁלֹ֖ף נַעֲלֽ⁠וֹ	1	The writer assumes that his readers will understand that the kinsman-redeemer gave the sandal to Boaz. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. See the UST.
4:9	zz42		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	לַ⁠זְּקֵנִ֜ים וְ⁠כָל־הָ⁠עָ֗ם	1	Here, **to the elders and to all the people** refers to all the people who were present at the meeting place, not to everyone in the town. The writer uses it here as a generalization for emphasis. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different way to express the emphasis. Alternate translation: [to everyone there, including the elders]
4:9	lwx9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	מִ⁠יַּ֖ד נָעֳמִֽי	1	The **hand of Naomi** represents Naomi. Since her husband and sons had died, the right to the property belonged to her. Alternate translation: [from Naomi]
4:9	img5			אֶת־כָּל־אֲשֶׁ֣ר לֶֽ⁠אֱלִימֶ֔לֶךְ וְ⁠אֵ֛ת כָּל־אֲשֶׁ֥ר לְ⁠כִלְי֖וֹן וּ⁠מַחְל֑וֹן	1	Alternate translation: [all the property that was formerly owned by Naomi’s deceased husband and sons]

4:10	nm32			לְ⁠הָקִ֤ים שֵׁם־הַ⁠מֵּת֙ עַל־נַ֣חֲלָת֔⁠וֹ	1	See how you translated this phrase in [4:5](../04/05.md). Alternate translation: [so that I might give her a son who will inherit the dead man’s property]
4:10	t2rm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	הַ⁠מֵּת֙ & הַ⁠מֵּ֛ת	1	Boaz is using the adjective **dead** as a noun to mean the one who died. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. See how you translated it in [4:5](../04/05.md). Alternate translation: [the man who died … the dead man]
4:10	gg1m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠לֹא־יִכָּרֵ֧ת שֵׁם־הַ⁠מֵּ֛ת מֵ⁠עִ֥ם אֶחָ֖י⁠ו וּ⁠מִ⁠שַּׁ֣עַר מְקוֹמ֑⁠וֹ	1	Being forgotten is spoken of here as if one’s name were being cut off from a list of one’s people. Alternate translation: [so that he will not be forgotten by his brothers’ descendants and by the people of this town]
4:10	ab61		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	וְ⁠לֹא־יִכָּרֵ֧ת שֵׁם־הַ⁠מֵּ֛ת מֵ⁠עִ֥ם אֶחָ֖י⁠ו וּ⁠מִ⁠שַּׁ֣עַר מְקוֹמ֑⁠וֹ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative **be cut off**. Alternate translation: [so that the name of the dead man will be preserved among his brothers and at the gate of his place]
4:10	xpu5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וּ⁠מִ⁠שַּׁ֣עַר מְקוֹמ֑⁠וֹ	1	Here, **the gate** refers to the location where the leaders gathered and made important legal decisions for **his place**, which refers to his town.

Alternate translation: [and the important people of his town]
4:10	ab45			עֵדִ֥ים אַתֶּ֖ם הַ⁠יּֽוֹם	1	Alternate translation: [You have seen and heard these things today and can speak of them tomorrow]
4:11	ua2a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הָ⁠עָ֧ם אֲשֶׁר־בַּ⁠שַּׁ֛עַר	1	The implication is that **the people who were in the gate** are the same people who heard and observed the meeting between Boaz and the man who had been first as kinsman-redeemer. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [the people who had observed Boaz’s meeting with the first kinsman-redeemer]
4:11	hg6q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הַ⁠בָּאָ֣ה אֶל־בֵּיתֶ֗⁠ךָ	1	This has both a literal and a figurative meaning. As Ruth marries Boaz, she will move into his physical house. “House” can be a metonym that represents “family,” so this also refers to becoming part of Boaz’s family by being his wife. Alternate translation: [who is becoming part of your family]
4:11	fcuk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing	יִתֵּן֩ יְהוָ֨ה אֶֽת־הָ⁠אִשָּׁ֜ה הַ⁠בָּאָ֣ה אֶל־בֵּיתֶ֗⁠ךָ כְּ⁠רָחֵ֤ל ׀ וּ⁠כְ⁠לֵאָה֙ אֲשֶׁ֨ר בָּנ֤וּ שְׁתֵּי⁠הֶם֙ אֶת־בֵּ֣ית יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל	1	Here, the people are asking God to bless Ruth. Their blessing continues for Ruth and Boaz through [verse 12](../04/12.md). You could express this as either a blessing or a prayer, in whichever way is more natural in your language. Alternate translation: [We ask Yahweh to make this woman who is coming into your house like Rachel and Leah, the two who built up the house of Israel]
4:11	q47m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כְּ⁠רָחֵ֤ל ׀ וּ⁠כְ⁠לֵאָה֙ אֲשֶׁ֨ר בָּנ֤וּ שְׁתֵּי⁠הֶם֙ אֶת־בֵּ֣ית יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל	1	**Rachel** and **Leah** are the names of two women, the two wives of Jacob, whose name was changed to Israel. They are considered to be the female ancestors of the people of Israel. They had many children, so implied in this blessing is the request that God give Ruth many children. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [like Rachel and Leah, who bore many children who then became the nation of Israel]
4:11	cz4t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בָּנ֤וּ & אֶת־בֵּ֣ית יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל	1	Here the people are speaking of the nation of **Israel** as if it were a **house**.

The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. The area around the town of Bethlehem was known as Ephrathah, and that became another name for the town. Presumably, this name came from the Israelite clan that settled in and around the city of Bethlehem. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: [May you prosper among your clan of Ephrathah, yes, may you be important in Bethlehem]
4:11	ab65		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	וַ⁠עֲשֵׂה־חַ֣יִל בְּ⁠אֶפְרָ֔תָה וּ⁠קְרָא־שֵׁ֖ם בְּ⁠בֵ֥ית לָֽחֶם	1	The verbs here are command forms, but they communicate the good desire of the people rather than commands. They serve to continue the blessing while shifting it from Ruth to Boaz. Use the style of blessing that is appropriate in your language. Alternate translation: [And you, Boaz, may you prosper among your clan of Ephrathah, yes, may you be important in Bethlehem]
4:12	fn52		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וִ⁠יהִ֤י בֵֽיתְ⁠ךָ֙ כְּ⁠בֵ֣ית פֶּ֔רֶץ	1	Here, **house** represents the people who might live in a house plus all of their descendants. Perez had many descendants who became large clans in Israel, including the clan of Ephrathah. Also, many of his descendants became important people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [And may your clan become like the clan of Perez]
4:12	xym8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing	מִן־הַ⁠זֶּ֗רַע אֲשֶׁ֨ר יִתֵּ֤ן יְהוָה֙ לְ⁠ךָ֔	1	The people are asking for a blessing from Yahweh, that through Ruth he would give Boaz many children who would do good things, just as Yahweh did for Perez. Use the form of blessing that is appropriate in your language.
4:13	abcc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	וַ⁠יִּקַּ֨ח בֹּ֤עַז אֶת־רוּת֙ וַ⁠תְּהִי־ל֣⁠וֹ לְ⁠אִשָּׁ֔ה	1	These two clauses mean basically the same thing. The second clause emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine the clauses into one clause. Alternate translation: [So Boaz took Ruth home to be his wife]
4:13	u21g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	וַ⁠יִּקַּ֨ח בֹּ֤עַז אֶת־רוּת֙	1	The word translated as **So** indicates that Boaz did what he said he would do in verse [4:10](../04/10.md). Use a connector in your language that makes it clear that what follows is a reason for what came before. This phrase does not imply any form of violence. Along with the following phrase, it simply means that Boaz married Ruth. Use a connecting word that indicates that this action by Boaz is a result of the agreement in verse [4:10](../04/10.md).
4:13	gw77		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	וַ⁠יָּבֹ֖א אֵלֶ֑י⁠הָ	1	The phrase, **he went in to her** is a polite way of referring to sexual intercourse. Use a polite way of referring to this in your language, or, if it is not offensive, you could state this plainly. Alternate translation: [and he slept with her]
4:14	ab46		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הַ⁠נָּשִׁים֙	1	These are **the women** of the town as mentioned in [1:19](../01/19.md). You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [the women of the town]
4:14	ab47		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing	בָּר֣וּךְ יְהוָ֔ה	1	The women are praising God for what he has done for Naomi and Ruth. If it does not make sense in your language to “bless” God, use a word like “praise” or “we give thanks.” Alternate translation: [We give thanks to Yahweh]
4:14	qj8v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	לֹ֣א הִשְׁבִּ֥ית לָ֛⁠ךְ גֹּאֵ֖ל הַ⁠יּ֑וֹם	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative preposition **without**. Alternate translation: [has provided you today with a kinsman to redeem you]
4:14	p8p3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing	וְ⁠יִקָּרֵ֥א שְׁמ֖⁠וֹ	1	This is a blessing, stating that the women desire that Naomi’s grandson will have a good reputation and character. Use the form of blessing that is appropriate in your language. Alternate translation: [May Yahweh make him a great man]
4:14	yjfd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠יִקָּרֵ֥א שְׁמ֖⁠וֹ בְּ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	Here, **name** represents the son’s person and reputation. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [May he become a great man in Israel]
4:15	hz3e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לְ⁠מֵשִׁ֣יב נֶ֔פֶשׁ	1	This phrase, **a restorer of life**, refers to how Naomi will again experience joy and hope in her life as a result of having this grandson. Alternate translation: [one who brings joy to you again] or [one who will make you feel young and strong again]
4:15	z5lw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וּ⁠לְ⁠כַלְכֵּ֖ל אֶת־שֵׂיבָתֵ֑⁠ךְ	1	Here, **old age** represents Naomi when she is old.
