In fact, throughout this letter, Paul commonly uses the plural pronouns “we” and “us” to refer to himself, Silvanus, and Timothy. Paul was originally from the city of Tarsus but lived in Jerusalem. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Paul was a Pharisee, and he persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, he traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire, telling people about Jesus. Paul first visited the Thessalonians during his second time traveling around the Roman Empire (see [Acts 17:1–10](../../act/17/01.md)). When people started persecuting the Christians in Thessalonica, Paul went to a city named Berea. Then he traveled to Athens and then to Corinth, where Timothy met him after visiting the Thessalonians (see [Acts 17:10–18:5](../../act/17/10.md)). When Timothy told Paul how the Thessalonians were doing, Paul wrote this letter to them in response.\n\n### What is the book of 1 Thessalonians about?\n\nPaul wrote 1 Thessalonians to make his relationship with the Thessalonians stronger and to teach them more about the gospel. He needed to do both of these things because, after he preached the gospel to the Thessalonians, persecution forced him to leave after only a few weeks.\n\nFirst, Paul wants the Thessalonians to know how much he was concerned about them and how joyful and thankful he was when he learned from Timothy that they were doing well. To accomplish this goal, he reminds the Thessalonians of how he and his fellow workers acted, he reminds the Thessalonians of how they responded, and he tells them how happy he is about the good news that Timothy brought. He tells them all these things to make his relationship with them stronger.\n\nAfter accomplishing this goal, he moves on to his second goal, which is to teach them more things about the gospel. It is possible that he was not able to teach some of these topics before he had to leave them. The primary topic he addresses is related to the day of Lord, the time in the future when Jesus will come back to this world. He also teaches them about sexual morality, loving fellow believers, the Holy Spirit, prophecies, and several other topics.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “First Thessalonians” or “1 Thessalonians.” Or they may choose a different title, such as “Paul’s First Letter to the Church in Thessalonica” or “A First Letter to the Christians in Thessalonica.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What was the city of Thessalonica like?\n\nThe city of Thessalonica was an important city in the province of Macedonia, which is in the northern part of what we now call Greece. Thessalonica was important because it had a harbor and major roads going through the city and because it was the capital of the province. Because it was an important city, there were people from many cultures and religions there, including Jews. Most people in the city worshiped many gods, including the emperors of Rome.\n\n### The “day of the Lord” and the “coming of the Lord”\n\nThe phrase “the day of the Lord” refers to the specific time in the future when Jesus will return to this world. Paul calls this event “the coming of the Lord.” Christians believe that, when Jesus comes back, God will resurrect all people, and Jesus will judge everyone, punish unbelievers, and reward believers. In this letter, Paul teaches the Thessalonians about what will happen to believers who have died before this “day” (see [4:13–18](../04/13.md)). He also teaches the Thessalonians about how to expect and prepare for this “day” (see [5:1–11](../05/01.md)).\n\n### Why were the Thessalonians concerned about believers who had died?\n\nIt is possible that Paul had to leave the Thessalonians before he finished teaching about what will happen when Jesus comes back. It is also possible that the Thessalonians thought that Jesus would come back before any believers died. We cannot be sure about the reason why they were concerned, but it is clear that they were afraid that believers who had died would not experience all the amazing and good things that will happen when Jesus comes back. Paul reassures them that believers who have died will live again and meet Jesus before anyone who is still alive meets him. Because of that, the Thessalonians do not need to be concerned about believers who have died.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### What did Paul mean by the expressions like “in Christ,” “in the Lord,” etc.?\n\nPaul frequently uses the spatial metaphor “in Christ” (often with another name for Christ, such as Lord or Jesus) in this letter. This metaphor emphasizes that believers are as closely united to Christ as if they were inside him. Paul believes that this is true for all believers, and sometimes he uses “in Christ” simply to identify that what he is speaking about is true for those who believe in Jesus. Other times, he emphasizes union with Christ as the means or the basis for some statement or exhortation. See the notes on specific verses for help in understanding the contextual meaning of “in Christ” and related phrases. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### What did Paul mean by the word “brothers”?\n\nPaul often uses the term “brothers” to mean people who share the same faith. Although this term is masculine, Paul uses the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If you decide to retain this figurative usage in your translation, you could state “brothers and sisters” to indicate that the word has this generic sense. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])\n\n### “We” and “you”\n\nIn this letter, unless a note specifies otherwise, the words “we,” “us,” and “our” always refer to Paul and his fellow workers, particularly Silvanus and Timothy, and do not include the Thessalonians. Also, in this letter, the words “you” and “your” are always plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### What are the major issues in the text of the book of 1 Thessalonians?\n\nIn the following verses, ancient manuscripts do not all have the same words. The ULT uses the words that are found in most of the earliest manuscripts. When you translate these verses, you should compare the ULT with any translations with which your readers may be familiar to see what your readers may expect. Unless there is a good reason to use the alternate words, you should follow the ULT. See the footnotes and notes at each of these verses for more information. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])\n\n  * “Grace to you and peace” ([1:1](../01/01.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.”\n  * “little children” ([2:7](../02/07.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “gentle.”\n  * “boasting” ([2:19](../02/19.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “great joy.”\n  * “a servant of God” ([3:2](../03/02.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “a fellow worker of God.” Other ancient manuscripts have this: “fellow worker.” Other ancient manuscripts have this: “a servant of God and our fellow worker.”\n  * “God … God” ([3:9](../03/09.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “Lord … Lord.”\n  * “the one giving” ([4:8](../04/08.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “the one having given.”\n  * “to you” ([4:8](../04/08.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “to us.”\n  * “you have” ([4:9](../04/09.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “we have.”\n  * “thieves” as the object of a verb ([5:4](../05/04.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “thief” as the subject of a verb.\n  * “Test all things” ([5:21](../05/21.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “But test all things.”\n  * “all the brothers” ([5:27](../05/27.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “all the holy brothers.”\n  * “with you” ([5:28](../05/28.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “with you. Amen.”
1:intro	y8c5				0	# 1 Thessalonians 1 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. Opening and blessing ([1:1](../01/01.md))\n2. Giving thanks for the Thessalonians ([1:2–10](../01/02.md))\n      * A prayer of thanks ([1:2–5](../01/02.md))\n      * The Thessalonians as examples ([1:6–10](../01/06.md))\n\nVerse 1 formally introduces this letter. Letters in the ancient Near East commonly had introductions of this type in which the senders identified themselves and the recipient and then gave a greeting.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Trinity\n\nGod the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit are mentioned numerous times in this chapter. Paul can speak of each of them individually, but he describes them working together as God. Make sure that your translation distinguishes between Father, Son, and Holy Spirit but still identifies them as God.\n\n### Imitators and examples\n\nIn [1:8](../01/08.md), Paul describes how the Thessalonians became “imitators” of the apostles and of Jesus. They became “imitators” when they suffered but still experienced joy from the Holy Spirit. Paul then describes how this behavior made them “examples” for other believers to imitate (see [1:7–8](../01/07.md)). Make sure that your translation indicates that the Thessalonians are imitating the apostles and Christ, which means that other people should imitate them.\n\n### The second coming\n\nIn [1:10](../01/10.md), Paul refers to the “second coming,” a specific day in the future in which Jesus will come back to earth, all dead people will come back to life, the world will be renewed, and God will judge people, punishing those who have sinned but rewarding those who believe in Jesus and obey him. Paul’s focus in this verse is especially on God’s judgment. Consider whether your readers will infer this information from what Paul says in [1:10](../01/10.md) or whether you should include some of this implied information.
1:1	ms5e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Παῦλος, καὶ Σιλουανὸς, καὶ Τιμόθεος; τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ	1	Your language may have a particular way of introducing the author of a letter and its intended audience. For example, you may want to indicate that this is a letter. Alternate translation: [I, Paul, along with Silvanus and Timothy, wrote this letter to you, the church]
1:1	zivb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Παῦλος, καὶ Σιλουανὸς, καὶ Τιμόθεος; τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ	1	**Paul** is the author of this letter. **Silvanus and Timothy** are with him as he writes and are in agreement with what he writes. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: [I, Paul, together with Silvanus and Timothy, write to the church]
1:1	r7n0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Σιλουανὸς	1	The name **Silvanus** is a longer form of the name **Silas**, the form of the name used for this same man in the book of Acts. You could choose to use the shorter form here as well, or you could choose to use the longer form here and include a footnote explaining that they are forms of the same name.
1:1	z7wu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν Θεῷ Πατρὶ καὶ Κυρίῳ Ἰησοῦ Χριστῷ	1	Here Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ** to describe the union of believers with **God** and **Christ**. In this case, being **in God** and **Christ**, or united to God and Christ, identifies the Thessalonians as Christians. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that indicates that the Thessalonians have a very close relationship with **God** and **Christ**. Alternate translation: [that is united to God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ] or [in union with God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ]
1:1	vlb3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	Θεῷ Πατρὶ καὶ Κυρίῳ Ἰησοῦ Χριστῷ	1	When **God** is called **Father**, it highlights his relationship to **Jesus** the “Son” (see [1:10](../01/10.md)). Here, the Old Testament title for **God**, **Lord**, is applied to **Jesus**, equating him with **God**. Be sure to retain these titles in your translation.
1:1	luw5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing	χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη	1	After stating his name and the people to whom he is writing, Paul adds a blessing.

1:1	qx70		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **Grace** and **peace**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: [I pray that God will be favorable to you and give you a peaceful spirit]
1:1	nn67		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	ὑμῖν	1	Throughout this letter the word **you** is plural and refers to the Thessalonian believers, unless otherwise noted.
1:1	e5eu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	χάρις ὑμῖν καὶ εἰρήνη	1	Many ancient manuscripts read **Grace to you and peace**. The ULT follows that reading. Other ancient manuscripts read “Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.” If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.

If it would be clearer in your language, you could reverse the order of the clauses. Alternate translation: [We continually make mention of you in our prayers, always giving thanks to God for all of you]
1:2	o7cp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	πάντοτε & ἀδιαλείπτως	1	Paul says **always** and **continually** here as generalizations for emphasis.

1:4	erb6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀδελφοὶ	1	Here and throughout the letter, Paul uses the term **brothers** to mean people who share the same faith. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [believing friends]
1:4	egkq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀδελφοὶ	1	Throughout the letter, although the term **brothers** is masculine, Paul is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women.

Alternate translation: [and that fits with what you know about what kind of men]
1:6	kgjr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ὑμεῖς & ἐγενήθητε	1	For emphasis, Paul is stating the pronoun **you**, which is already implied in the verb **became**.

1:9	ou5h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Θεῷ ζῶντι καὶ ἀληθινῷ	1	Here, the phrase **living and true God** identifies God as the one who lives and is truly God.

1:10	ffro		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἤγειρεν ἐκ τῶν νεκρῶν	1	Here, the phrase **raised from the dead** refers to someone who died and came back to life.

2:intro	kt5l				0	# 1 Thessalonians 2 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n3. The visit with the Thessalonians ([2:1–16](../02/01.md))\n      * How Paul and his fellow workers behaved ([2:1–12](../02/01.md))\n      * How the Thessalonians responded ([2:13–16](../02/13.md)\n4. Separation from the Thessalonians ([2:17–20](../02/17.md))\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Paul’s previous visit with the Thessalonians\n\nBefore he wrote this letter, Paul had briefly visited the city of Thessalonica and preached the gospel. He may have been in this city for only three weeks (see [Acts 17:2](../../act/17/02.md)), but many people still believed in Jesus during this time. They started the church of the Thessalonians, to whom Paul wrote this letter. However, Paul had to leave the city quickly because some Jewish people started a riot and tried to seize Paul and his fellow workers. You can read about this story in [Acts 17:1–10](../../act/17/01.md). In this chapter, Paul describes how he and his fellow workers acted when he visited them, and he describes how the believers responded (see [2:1–13](../02/01.md)). He also refers to how some Jewish people persecuted him and his fellow workers (see [2:15–16](../02/15.md)). Finally, he describes how he wants to visit them again after he and his fellow workers had to leave so soon (see [2:17–20](../02/17.md)).\n\n### God and the Thessalonians as “witnesses”\n\nIn [2:5](../02/05.md) and [2:10](../02/10.md), Paul names God as a “witness” to what he is saying, and he also names the Thessalonians as “witnesses” in [2:10](../02/10.md). Witnesses testify about whether something is true, so Paul names God and the Thessalonians as witnesses to show the Thessalonians that what he is saying is true. Your language may have a specific form for appealing to someone to guarantee that a statement is true.\n\n### “The Jews”\n\nIn [2:14–16](../02/14.md), Paul refers to people whom he calls “the Jews.” He does not mean Jewish people in general, since he refers to “the churches of God that are in Judea” as a separate group, and most if not all of these people were Jewish. Paul himself clarifies that he means “the ones having killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets and having persecuted us.” This does not describe one group of people only, since many of the people who killed God’s “prophets” died before Jesus came. What it does describe is a type of person: a person who opposes God and his messengers. When Paul refers to “the Jews” in this chapter, then, he is referring to Jewish people who oppose God and his messengers. You may need to make this more explicit in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Figures of speech related to families\n\nIn this chapter, Paul describes himself and his fellow workers as “little children” ([2:7](../02/07.md)), “mothers” ([2:7](../02/07.md)), and “fathers” ([2:11](../02/11.md)). He also refers to the Thessalonians as “brothers” ([2:1](../02/01.md), [9](../02/09.md), [14](../02/14.md), [17](../02/17.md)). Paul describes himself and his fellow workers in these ways to show the Thessalonians that he and his fellow workers love and care about them as if they were members of the same family. Paul especially emphasizes this since he was only with the Thessalonians for a short period of time. If possible, preserve the figures of speech that describe the Thessalonians, Paul, and his fellow workers as members of the same family.
2:1	ii5j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a longer explanation of the “entrance” that Paul and his fellow workers had among the Thessalonians (see [1:9](../01/09.md)). This explanation is found in [2:1–12](../02/01.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an explanation of a previous statement. Alternate translation: [Concerning our entrance to you,] or [Now about your visit,]
2:1	gpr4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτοὶ & οἴδατε	1	For emphasis, Paul is stating the pronoun **you**, which is already implied in the verb **know**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. The ULT does so by using the intensive pronoun **yourselves**. Alternate translation: [as for you, you know] or [it is you who know]
2:1	r6cy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὴν εἴσοδον ἡμῶν τὴν πρὸς ὑμᾶς	1	Here, just as in [1:9](../01/09.md), Paul refers to his and his fellow workers’ visit to the Thessalonians as an **entrance**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: [that our visit with you] or [that our time with you]
2:1	w584		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	οὐ κενὴ γέγονεν	1	Paul is using a figure of speech here that expresses a strongly positive meaning by using a negative word, **not**, together with an expression that is the opposite of the intended meaning, **in vain**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the positive meaning. Alternate translation: [has definitely been worthwhile] or [has been very useful]
2:2	nt5n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλὰ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces a contrast with how Paul and his fellow workers might have visited the Thessalonians “in vain” (see [2:1](../02/01.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces this kind of contrast. Alternate translation: [Rather,] or [Instead of acting in vain,]
2:2	h9s8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	προπαθόντες καὶ ὑβρισθέντες, καθὼς οἴδατε, ἐν Φιλίπποις	1	These words provide background information about what happened when Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy were in the city of Philippi. You can read about this in [Acts 16:16–40](../../act/16/16.md). Use a natural form in your language for expressing background information. Alternate translation: [even though we suffered and were shamefully treated when we were in Philippi, just as you know]
2:2	w0qu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	προπαθόντες καὶ ὑβρισθέντες	1	Here, the phrases **having previously suffered and having been shamefully treated** refer to something that contrasts with **we were bold**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could introduce the phrases **having previously suffered and having been shamefully treated** with a word or phrase that introduces a contrast or something that is unexpected. Alternate translation: [despite having previously suffered and having been shamefully treated] or [even though we suffered previously and were shamefully treated]
2:2	fac4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	προπαθόντες καὶ ὑβρισθέντες	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The repetition is used to emphasize how much the apostles suffered. If your language does not use repetition in this way, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: [having earlier suffered violently] or [having already been shamefully abused]
2:2	f5d2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὑβρισθέντες	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [having experienced mistreatment] or [people having mistreated us]
2:2	clqq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	ἀλλὰ προπαθόντες καὶ ὑβρισθέντες, καθὼς οἴδατε, ἐν Φιλίπποις	1	Here Paul includes the phrase **just as you know** at the end of the information that he says they **know**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could move **just as you know** to wherever it would be natural in your language. Alternate translation: [But, just as you know, having previously suffered and having been shamefully treated at Philippi]
2:2	ddlx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν τῷ Θεῷ ἡμῶν	1	Here Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in God** to describe the union of believers with **God**. In this case, being **in God**, or united to God, explains how Paul and his fellow workers were able to be **bold**. Paul could mean more specifically that: (1) **God** enabled them to be bold. Alternate translation: [with boldness from God]; (2) they were bold because of their union with **God**. Alternate translation: [because of our union with God]
2:2	daei		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὸ εὐαγγέλιον τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Here, Paul is using the possessive form to describe a **gospel** that relates to **God**.

2:3	sckc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἡ & παράκλησις ἡμῶν	1	Here Paul could be implying that this **exhortation** was addressed to: (1) the Thessalonians specifically. Alternate translation: [our exhortation to you]; (2) anyone to whom Paul and his fellow workers proclaim the gospel. Alternate translation: [our exhortation to people]
2:3	mzm6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐκ ἐκ πλάνης	1	Here Paul could be implying that the **exhortation** was not **from error** because: (1) he and his fellow workers did not try to convince the Thessalonians to believe what is wrong. Alternate translation: [was neither from false teaching]; (2) he and his fellow workers did not believe what is wrong. Alternate translation: [was neither from false beliefs]
2:4	m8sq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	καθὼς δεδοκιμάσμεθα ὑπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ, πιστευθῆναι τὸ εὐαγγέλιον, οὕτως λαλοῦμεν	1	Here Paul describes the manner in which he and his fellow workers **speak** something before he says that they **speak**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could rearrange the elements so that Paul says what he is doing before he describes the manner in which he does it. Alternate translation: [we speak as those who have been examined by God to be entrusted with the gospel]
2:4	ue4y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	δεδοκιμάσμεθα ὑπὸ τοῦ Θεοῦ, πιστευθῆναι	1	If your language does not use these passive forms, you could express the idea with active forms or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [God has examined us to entrust us with]
2:4	lfv7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	πιστευθῆναι	1	Here, the phrase **to be entrusted** introduces the result of being **examined by God**. Paul implies that God approved of them when he **examined** them, and so they were **entrusted with the gospel**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that introduces the result of a test or examination. Alternate translation: [with the result that we were entrusted with] or [and approved to be entrusted with]
2:4	qqj2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἀλλὰ Θεῷ	1	Paul is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

2:6	j6c4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἀνθρώπων	1	Although the term **men** is masculine, Paul is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women.

2:7	u7y2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	νήπιοι	1	Here, many ancient manuscripts read **little children**. The ULT follows that reading. Other ancient manuscripts read “gentle.” If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
2:7	bnp2			ἐν μέσῳ ὑμῶν	1	Alternate translation: [among you] or [when we visited you]
2:7	ag1l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ὡς ἐὰν τροφὸς θάλπῃ τὰ ἑαυτῆς τέκνα	1	The point of this comparison is that in the same way a **mother** would gently **comfort her own children**, so the apostles gently and affectionately cared for the Thessalonians.

Alternate translation: [and we loved you like mother who affectionately cares for her own children] or [as we affectionately cared for you]
2:7	q9bv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	ἐν μέσῳ ὑμῶν, ὡς ἐὰν τροφὸς θάλπῃ τὰ ἑαυτῆς τέκνα	1	Here, the clause **as if a mother might comfort her own children** could be: (1) a further explanation of what Paul has already said about how they acted like **children**. Alternate translation: [in the midst of you, just as a mother might comfort her own children]; (2) a description of what he is about to say about how they long for the Thessalonians (see [2:8](../02/08.md)). If you use the following alternate translation, you will need to to continue the sentence in the following verse instead of starting a new sentence there. Alternate translation: [in the midst of you. As a mother might comfort her own children,]
2:8	r8b4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὕτως	1	Here, the phrase **in this manner** could: (1) refer back to what Paul said in the previous verse about how he and his fellow workers love and care for the Thessalonians as if they were the Thessalonians’ mothers. Alternate translation: [in that very way] or [as a mother does]; (2) make the word **longing** stronger. Alternate translation: [so very much]; (3) refer ahead to what Paul and his fellow workers did because of their **longing**. Alternate translation: [in the following way:]

3:intro	j379				0	# 1 Thessalonians 3 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n5. Timothy’s visit and good news ([3:1–10](../03/01.md))\n6. A benediction ([3:11–13](../03/11.md))\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Timothy’s return to Paul\n\nAfter Paul, Timothy, and Silvanus left Thessalonica, they visited a city named Berea. Then, they visited a city named Athens. In [3:1](../03/01.md), Paul mentions that he and Silvanus stayed in Athens and sent Timothy to visit the Thessalonians. Eventually, Paul left Athens and went to Corinth. While he was in Corinth, Timothy returned from visiting the Thessalonians (see [Acts 18:1–5](../../act/18/01.md)). In this chapter, Paul explains how happy he and his fellow workers became when they heard good news from Timothy about the Thessalonians. In fact, Timothy’s return to Paul is the reason why Paul wrote this letter.\n\n### Afflictions\n\nThroughout this chapter, Paul refers to how he, his fellow workers, and other believers (including the Thessalonians) are or will experience afflictions. When Paul and his fellow workers visited Thessalonica and a nearby town named Berea, some other Jewish people tried to hurt them and have them arrested. These people also persecuted anyone who believed the gospel. You can read about these afflictions in [Acts 17:1–15](../../act/17/01.md). Make sure that your translation clearly indicates this kind of persecution.\n\n### Paul’s prayer\n\nIn [3:11–13](../03/11.md), Paul includes a prayer that God would enable him and his fellow workers to visit the Thessalonians and that God would strengthen and bless the Thessalonians. Paul refers to God in the third person in this prayer, which was a common practice for this kind of prayer. Consider how you might include a prayer to God within a letter in your culture.

In this case, Paul uses the plural form to refer to himself only. Alternate translation: [enduring it no longer, I thought it good that I should be left behind]
3:1	ml5t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	καταλειφθῆναι	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [to remain] or [to have everyone else leave us behind]

Alternate translation: [just before I started writing this letter,] or [a short while ago,]

4:intro	b1z5				0	# 1 Thessalonians 4 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n7. Teaching on sexual morality ([4:1–8](../04/01.md))\n8. Teaching on Christian love ([4:9–12](../04/09.md))\n9. Teaching on the day of the Lord ([4:13–5:11](../04/01.md))\n      * Dead believers and the day of the Lord ([4:13–18](../04/13.md))\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Sexual morality\n\nIn [4:3–8](../04/03.md), Paul commands the Thessalonians to act in holy ways, particularly in relation to their sexual behavior. He does not provide specific details, but he does require them to exercise self-control and to avoid hurting a fellow believer. In the Thessalonians’ culture, sexual immorality was very common. Men and women would have sex with people who were not their own spouses, and older men would have sex with younger men. If a Christian had sex with another Christian to whom he or she was not married, it could easily hurt or exploit that person or that person’s family. Paul wants the Corinthians to completely avoid this possibility.\n\n### Brotherly love\n\nIn [4:9–12](../04/09.md), Paul praises the Corinthians for showing “brotherly love.” He means that they love each other as if they were members of the same family. He also encourages them to show this kind of love even more, which includes staying out of other people’s private affairs and making sure that they can provide for themselves instead of depending on other people.\n\n### Dead believers\n\nThe Thessalonians were worried that believers who had died might not experience some of the wonderful things that will happen when Jesus comes back. In [4:13–18](../04/13.md), Paul assures them that believers who had died not miss anything when Jesus comes back. In fact, he tells them that believers who have died will meet Jesus first, before everyone who is still alive meets him. He wants them to encourage or comfort each other with this teaching.\n\n### The coming of the Lord\n\nIn [4:13–18](../04/13.md), Paul teaches the Thessalonians about what will happen when Jesus comes back. He describes Jesus’ return with powerful language that includes angels, people being lifted up into the sky, and loud sounds. Scholars debate whether Paul described Jesus’ return with symbolic language or whether he described specific events that will happen when Jesus comes back. Your translation should express Paul’s descriptions as clearly as possible while allowing for both interpretations of his words.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### “His own vessel”\n\nIn [4:4](../04/04.md), Paul urges each Thessalonian to “possess his own vessel in sanctification and honor.” Paul could be using the word “vessel” in several different ways. First (1), and most likely, he could be using “vessel” as a euphemism for the sexual organ. In this case, he is urging the Thessalonians to have self-control over their sexual desires the acts. Also, he is addressing men directly but also includes women in his command. Second (2), he could be using “vessel” as a metaphor for the physical body. In this case, he is focusing particularly on the sexual aspect of the physical body, just like in option (1). Third (3), and least likely, Paul could be using “vessel” as a metaphor for a man’s wife. In this case, he is urging each Thessalonian man to be sexually faithful to his wife. It is recommended that you follow option (1) or perhaps option (2) since these are the most likely explanations for why Paul uses the word “vessel.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### “The ones sleeping”\n\nIn [4:13–15](../04/13.md), Paul refers to people who are “sleeping.” This was a polite way in his culture to refer to people who had died. Paul does not have any deeper meaning in mind. Consider how, in your culture, you might politely refer to people who had died. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Did Paul think that Jesus would come back before he himself died?\n\nIn [4:15](../04/15.md) and [4:17](../04/17.md), Paul uses the word “we” to include himself among the believers who are alive when Jesus comes back. Some scholars think that this implies that Paul believed or hoped that Jesus would come back before Paul died. However, other scholars think that Paul used the word “we” because he was referring to believers who are alive, and of course he was alive when he wrote this letter. In your translation, you should use an inclusive form of “we” if your language marks that distinction, but you should not include any further clarification.\n\n### What is the sequence of events in [4:15–17](../04/15.md)?\n\nIn these verses, Paul describes several events that will occur in sequence. Based on what he says, we can be relatively sure that the following three events will occur in this order: (1) the Lord Jesus will come down from heaven, (2) believers who have died will resurrect and go with the Lord, and (3) believers who are still alive with be taken up to meet the Lord in the air. It is less clear whether the “loud command,” the “voice of an archangel” and the “trumpet of God” happen before or during Jesus’ descent from heaven. Also, it is not clear whether Jesus and believers go up to heaven or come back to earth, although coming back to earth is slightly more likely. Make sure that your translation clearly presents the three main events in sequence, and if possible, allow for several different interpretations for the other elements.

Alternate translation: [rejects God, not man, and God is the one who gives]
4:8	b7q5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἄνθρωπον	1	Although the term **man** is masculine, Paul is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women.

4:8	zm4y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	τὸν διδόντα	1	Here Paul is adding more information about **God**. He is not distinguishing between different gods.

4:9	zroq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτοὶ & ὑμεῖς & ἐστε	1	For emphasis, Paul is stating the pronoun **you**, which is already implied in the verb **are**.

Alternate translation: [the outsiders] or [the unbelievers]
4:12	nait		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μηδενὸς	1	Here word translated **nothing** could refer: (1) to things. In this case, Paul wants them to have everything that they need.

Alternate translation: [of nobody] or [of support from no person]
4:13	vi2y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **Now** introduces a new section in the letter.

4:13	j68e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	τῶν κοιμωμένων	1	Here, the phrase **the ones sleeping** is a polite way to refer to people who have died.

4:13	jggl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	οἱ λοιποὶ, οἱ μὴ ἔχοντες ἐλπίδα	1	Paul is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You could supply these words from earlier in the sentence if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: [the rest grieve, the ones not having hope] or [the rest who have no hope grieve]
4:13	p5zs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	οἱ λοιποὶ, οἱ μὴ ἔχοντες ἐλπίδα	1	Here Paul is distinguishing between people who have hope and people who do not have hope.

4:13	r9f8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	οἱ λοιποὶ	1	Paul is using the adjective **rest** as a noun to refer to a group of people that includes everyone who does not have hope. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: [the rest of people] or [everyone else]
4:13	f9eq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐλπίδα	1	Here Paul implies that the **hope** concerns what happens to people after they die.

4:14	mola		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a reason why the Thessalonians should not grieve like other people do. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a reason or basis for a claim, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: [You should not grieve in those ways because,] or [Indeed,]
4:14	j09o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ	1	Paul speaks as if this were a hypothetical situation, but he means that it must be true.

Alternate translation: [because]
4:14	ybz6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	πιστεύομεν	1	Here, the word **we** includes Paul, his fellow workers, and the Thessalonians, so use the inclusive form of that word in your translation if your language marks that distinction.

4:14	qehi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ Θεὸς τοὺς κοιμηθέντας διὰ τοῦ Ἰησοῦ ἄξει σὺν αὐτῷ	1	Here Paul does not explicitly state all the elements in his comparison between **Jesus** and the **the ones having slept**. He states that Jesus **died and rose**, and he implies that this will be true for **the ones having slept**.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could make these two implicit ideas more explicit.

4:14	tjqj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτῷ	1	The pronoun **him** refers to **Jesus**. If this is not clear for your readers, you could use the person’s name here. Alternate translation: [with Jesus]
4:15	vvda		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a further explanation of what Paul has said about believers who have died.

4:15	cbk8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	τοῦτο & ὑμῖν λέγομεν ἐν λόγῳ Κυρίου, ὅτι	1	Here, the word **this** refers to what Paul introduces with the word **that**.

Alternate translation: [we say to you in a word of the Lord that] or [here is what we say to you in a word of the Lord:]
4:15	fdwk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	λέγομεν & ἡμεῖς οἱ ζῶντες	1	Here, the word **we** in the phrase **we say** only includes Paul and his fellow workers. It does not include the Thessalonians. However, the word **we** in the phrase **we, the ones living** does include the Thessalonians. Make sure that this is clear if your language marks these distinctions.
4:15	ni3m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	λόγῳ	1	Paul is using the term **word** to mean a message that is shared by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [a message] or [words]

4:15	xd2y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐ μὴ φθάσωμεν	1	The words translated **certainly not** are two negative words. In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: [will by no means go before]
4:15	b786		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐ μὴ φθάσωμεν	1	Here, the phrase **will certainly not go before** indicates that people who are alive when Jesus comes back will not meet him first. Instead, believers who have died will meet him first, and then believers who are alive will meet him. Paul explains this further in the following verse (see [4:16](../04/16.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: [will certainly not go to Jesus before] or [will certainly not be with Jesus before]

4:16	ah7p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	ὅτι	1	Here, the word **For** introduces an elaboration or explanation of what Paul said in the previous verse about how living believers will not “go before” dead believers (see [4:15](../04/15.md)). This explanation continues in [4:17](../04/17.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an elaboration or explanation. Alternate translation: [Here is what I mean:] or [More specifically,]
4:16	ygfp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτὸς ὁ Κύριος	1	For emphasis, Paul is stating the pronoun “him,” which is already implied in the verbal phrase **will come down**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. The ULT does so by using the intensive pronoun **himself**. Alternate translation: [it is the Lord who] or [as for the Lord, he]
4:16	c26b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	ἐν κελεύσματι, ἐν φωνῇ ἀρχαγγέλου, καὶ ἐν σάλπιγγι Θεοῦ	1	Here Paul provides a list with three items. This list might refer to: (1) three different actions that all make sounds. Alternate translation: [with a loud command, the voice of an archangel, and a trumpet of God]; (2) one action, the **loud command**. This **command** is made up of the **voice of an archangel** and the **trumpet of God**. Alternate translation: [with a loud command given by the voice of an archangel and by a trumpet of God]; (3) two different actions, the **loud command** and the **voice of an archangel**, and the **archangel** uses **a trumpet of God**. Alternate translation: [with a loud command and with the voice of an archangel who uses a trumpet of God]
4:16	z9ka		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν κελεύσματι	1	Here Paul does not specify who gives the **loud command**. He implies that it is God. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: [with a loud command from God]
4:16	breq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	σάλπιγγι Θεοῦ	1	Paul is using the possessive form to describe **a trumpet** that is related to **God**. More specifically, the **trumpet** could: (1) be one that **God** commands to be blown. Alternate translation: [a trumpet that God has someone blow]; (2) belong to **God**. Alternate translation: [God’s trumpet]
4:16	k7sg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	καὶ	2	Here, the word **and** introduces an event that comes after the previously described events. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase introduces the next event in a sequence. Alternate translation: [and then] or [and after that]
4:16	dr89		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	οἱ νεκροὶ	1	Paul is using the adjective **dead** as a noun in order to refer to believers who are **dead**. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: [the dead people]
4:16	xrxu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν Χριστῷ	1	Here Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in Christ** to describe the union of believers with **Christ**. In this case, being **in Christ**, or united to Christ, indicates that Paul is speaking only about **the dead** who are united to Christ, that is, believers. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that indicates that Paul is speaking about believers who have died. Alternate translation: [Christians] or [who believed in Christ]
4:16	xbvx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἀναστήσονται	1	Here, the word **rise** refers to people who had died then coming back to life. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable idiom or express the idea plainly. Alternate translation: [will be restored to life] or [will resurrect]
4:16	q6s9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πρῶτον	1	Here, the word **first** indicates that, after Jesus comes down from heaven, **the dead in Christ** will resurrect before anything else happens. Paul indicates in the following verse what happens after they resurrect. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: [before anything else happens] or [immediately afterwards]
4:17	iy00		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	ἔπειτα	1	Here, the word **Then** indicates that what Paul is about to describe will only happen after the events he described in the previous verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that introduces the next event in a sequence. Alternate translation: [Next,] or [Afterward,]
4:17	pknb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἡμεῖς οἱ ζῶντες, οἱ περιλειπόμενοι ἅμα σὺν αὐτοῖς, ἁρπαγησόμεθα	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, it is clear from the context that it was God. Alternate translation: [God will catch us, the ones living, the ones surviving, up together with them]
4:17	l5l1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμεῖς & πάντοτε & ἐσόμεθα	1	By **we** in both clauses, Paul includes himself, his fellow workers, and the Thessalonians, so use the inclusive form of that word in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
4:17	fc63		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	ἡμεῖς οἱ ζῶντες, οἱ περιλειπόμενοι	1	Here, the phrases **the ones living** and **the ones surviving** distinguish **we** from other people. Be sure that this distinction is clear in your translation. See how you translated the similar phrases in [4:15](../04/15.md). Alternate translation: [we, by which I mean those of us who live, who survive]
4:17	otiq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτοῖς	1	The pronoun **them** refers to “the dead in Christ” who resurrect. Paul mentioned them in the previous verse. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the referent more explicit. Alternate translation: [the resurrected believers] or [the dead who live again]
4:17	m3gb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν νεφέλαις	1	Here, the phrase **in the clouds** could refer to: (1) the place where believers meet the Lord. In other words, the **clouds** are in the **air**, which is where believers **meet the Lord**. Alternate translation: [up among the clouds]; (2) the means by which believers go to meet the Lord. In this case, the **clouds** are what believers stand on as they go to meet the Lord. Some people in Paul’s culture told stories about people standing on clouds as they traveled to heaven. Alternate translation: [on the clouds] or [by means of clouds]
4:17	o7lj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἰς ἀπάντησιν τοῦ Κυρίου εἰς ἀέρα	1	Here, the phrase **to meet** refers to going to greet someone. Paul could be implying that, after believers greet him, Jesus: (1) continues to earth with all believers. Alternate translation: [to meet the Lord in the air and return to earth with him]; (2) goes back up to heaven with all believers, either temporarily or eternally. Alternate translation: [to meet the Lord in the air and go back to heaven with him]
4:17	buz9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἰς ἀέρα	1	Here, the phrase **in the air** refers to the area above the earth but below heaven, an area often called the sky. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to this area. Alternate translation: [above the earth] or [up in the atmosphere]
4:17	ouvu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὕτως	1	Here, the phrase **in this way** refers to the process that Paul has outlined in this verse and the previous verse.

4:18	gt91		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ὥστε	1	Here, the word **Therefore** introduces what Paul wants the Thessalonians to do in response to what he has told them about Jesus’ second coming and the resurrection of dead believers. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the application of a specific teaching. Alternate translation: [So then] or [Now that I have taught you these things]
4:18	xsus		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν τοῖς λόγοις τούτοις	1	Here, the phrase **these words** refers to what Paul has said in [4:13–17](../04/13.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers back to this entire section. Alternate translation: [with all these things that I have taught you] or [with the message I have spoken]
5:intro	ay3d				0	# 1 Thessalonians 5 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n9. Teaching on the day of the Lord ([4:13–5:11](../04/01.md))\n      * The timing of the day of the Lord ([5:1–11](../05/01.md))\n10. Final Commands ([5:11–22](../05/11.md))\n11. Closing ([5:23–28](../05/23.md))\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### The timing of the Lord’s coming\n\nIn [4:13–18](../04/13.md), Paul taught the Thessalonians about what will happen to believers who die before Jesus comes back. In [5:1–11](../05/01.md), he teaches them about how the timing of Jesus’ return should impact how they live now. In these verses, he informs the Thessalonians that Jesus’ second coming will surprise people. Scholars debate whether Paul meant that it would surprise everyone or just people who do not believe. Most likely, Paul meant that no one can know for sure when Jesus will return, but believers will be ready for it while unbelievers will not be ready for it. Paul then explains what the Thessalonians should do to be ready for Jesus’ return: they should “put on” faith, hope, and love (see [5:8](../05/08.md)).\n\n### The Spirit and prophecies\n\nIn [5:19–20](../05/19.md), Paul warns the Thessalonians against “quenching” the Holy Spirit and despising prophecies. Most likely, the commands in the next two verses also relate to prophecies (see [5:21–22](../05/21.md)): the Thessalonians should test all prophecies, hold to those that are right, and avoid those that are wrong. So, Paul wants them to respect all prophecies, since true prophecy comes from the Holy Spirit. However, he also wants them to test prophecies to make sure they really do come from the Holy Spirit. These verses are very short and imply some information, so you may need to make some of these ideas more explicit. See the notes on these verses for translation options.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Thief similes\n\nIn [5:2](../05/02.md) and [5:4](../05/04.md), Paul compares Jesus’ second coming to what thieves do and experience. In [5:2](../05/02.md), Paul indicates that Jesus’ second coming will be surprising, just as a thief breaking into a house is surprising. In [5:4](../05/04.md), ancient manuscripts differ in how they express the simile. The reading that the ULT follows indicates that Jesus’ second coming will surprise people who are doing what is wrong, just like the daylight surprises thieves who are breaking into a house. The reading that the ULT mentions in a footnote indicates that Jesus’ second coming is surprising, just as a thief breaking into a house is surprising. With these similes, Paul compares Jesus’ second coming to what thieves do and experience to indicate that Jesus’ second coming will surprise people. Make sure that this meaning is clear in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])\n\n### Birth pain simile\n\nIn [5:3](../05/03.md), Paul compares Jesus’ second coming to the birth pains that a woman experiences during labor. Just as these birth pains come suddenly and cannot be avoided, so Jesus’ second coming will come suddenly, and unbelievers will not be able to escape from Jesus’ judgment. Make sure that this meaning is clear in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])\n\n### Day and night, light and darkness\n\nThroughout [5:1–11](../05/01.md), Paul refers to day and light in contrast to night and darkness. In [5:2](../05/02.md) Paul uses the word “day” in the phrase “the day of the Lord.” In the following verses, he develops the imagery of day and night so that it connects with the idea of the “day of the Lord.” He speaks of people who live in the “day” and in the “light,” which figuratively describes people who know that Jesus is coming back and who live properly and obey God. These people will not be surprised or judged on the “day of the Lord,” since they are “of day.” On the other hand, Paul speaks of people who live in the “night” and in the “darkness,” which figuratively describes people who do not expect Jesus to come back and who live sinfully and disobey God. These people will be surprised and judged on the “day of the Lord,” since they are not “of day.” So, people who want to avoid being judged on “the day of Lord” must live as people “of day,” that is, as obedient and watchful people. Since Paul’s day and night metaphor is directed related to the phrase “the day of the Lord,” preserve the language of day and night if possible. See the notes on these verses for translation possibilities. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Putting on armor\n\nIn [5:8](../05/08.md), Paul commands the Thessalonians to put on armor, specifically a “breastplate” and a “helmet.” A “breastplate” is armor that protects the vital organs, including the heart and lungs. Paul identifies the “breastplate” with faith and love. A “helmet” is armor that protects the head. Paul identifies the “helmet” with hope. It is unlikely that Paul expected the Thessalonians to interpret these two specific pieces of armor in special ways. Rather, Paul wants the Thessalonians to think about faith, love, and hope as if they were pieces of armor that protect them from evil powers, including sin and the devil. Since Paul uses similar armor metaphors in other letters, preserve the armor language if possible. See the notes on these verses for translation possibilities. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n#### Quenching the Holy Spirit\n\nIn [5:19](../05/19.md), Paul refers to hindering the Holy Spirit as if it were “quenching” a fire. Other passages in the Bible connect the Holy Spirit with fire (for example, see [Acts 2:1–4](../../act/02/01.md)), so if possible preserve the metaphor or express the idea as a simile. See the notes on this verse for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
5:1	i2vm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **Now** introduces a new section in the letter. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a new section, or you could leave **Now** untranslated. Alternate translation: [Next,]
5:1	y4cv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῶν χρόνων καὶ τῶν καιρῶν	1	Here Paul implies that **the times and the seasons** relate to questions concerning when Jesus will come back. In other words, Paul has begun to talk about the timing of Jesus’ second coming. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: [the times and the seasons after which Jesus will return] or [the times and the seasons related to Jesus’ second coming]
5:1	a8f3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	τῶν χρόνων καὶ τῶν καιρῶν	1	The terms **times** and **seasons** mean similar things. Paul is using the two terms together to refer in general to the timing of Jesus’ second coming. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express this idea with a single phrase. Alternate translation: [the precise time] or [the periods of time]
5:1	caue		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὑμῖν γράφεσθαι	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who would do the action, it is clear from the context that it would be Paul and his fellow workers. Alternate translation: [for us to write anything to you]
5:2	mcq9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a reason why the Thessalonians “have no need for anything to be written” to them about the timing of Jesus’ second coming. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a reason or basis for a previous claim. Alternate translation: [In fact,] or [Indeed,]
5:2	dqgk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτοὶ & ἀκριβῶς οἴδατε	1	For emphasis, Paul is stating the pronoun **you**, which is already implied in the verb **know**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. The ULT does so by using the intensive pronoun **yourselves**. Alternate translation: [as for you, you know perfectly well] or [it is you who know perfectly well]
5:2	rss4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	ἔρχεται	1	Here, Paul speaks of **the day of the Lord** as if it were a person who could come to a place.

5:2	tmj3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ὡς κλέπτης ἐν νυκτὶ οὕτως ἔρχεται	1	Paul is saying that **the day of the Lord** is like **a thief in the night** because people cannot tell when either one will happen. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: [comes in this manner—unexpectedly, as a thief comes unexpectedly in the night] or [comes when people are not looking for it, just as thief steals in the night when people are not looking]
5:2	yvg3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	ὡς & οὕτως	1	Having both terms **in this manner** and **as** in this sentence may be redundant in your language. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: [as]
5:3	tbsh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	ὅταν λέγωσιν, εἰρήνη καὶ ἀσφάλεια, τότε αἰφνίδιος αὐτοῖς ἐφίσταται ὄλεθρος	1	Here Paul uses the present tense forms **say** and **comes** to refer to something that will happen in the future. He uses the present tense to indicate that these things will certainly happen. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the future tense. Alternate translation: [Whenever they will be saying, “Peace and safety,” then sudden destruction will come on them]
5:3	p1wi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	ὅταν λέγωσιν, εἰρήνη καὶ ἀσφάλεια, τότε αἰφνίδιος & ὄλεθρος	1	Here, the word **Whenever** introduces something that is happening when the **sudden destruction comes**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that describes things that happen at the same time. Alternate translation: [While they are saying, “Peace and safety,” sudden destruction] or [They will be saying, “Peace and safety,” but then sudden destruction]
5:3	xzxf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	λέγωσιν, εἰρήνη καὶ ἀσφάλεια, τότε	1	It may be more natural in your language to have an indirect quotation here. Alternate translation: [they say that there is peace and safety, then]
5:3	wqgz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	λέγωσιν & αὐτοῖς & οὐ μὴ ἐκφύγωσιν	1	Here, the pronouns **they**, **them**, and **they** refer to every person who is not a believer. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: [unbelievers say … on them … they will certainly not escape]
5:3	mjvd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εἰρήνη καὶ ἀσφάλεια	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **Peace** and **safety**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: [We are peaceful and safe] or [We live peacefully and safely]
5:3	ne9n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	αἰφνίδιος αὐτοῖς ἐφίσταται ὄλεθρος, ὥσπερ ἡ ὠδὶν τῇ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **destruction**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [they will suddenly be destroyed, just as the birth pain comes to the one]
5:3	bw2z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὄλεθρος	1	Here, the word **destruction** refers to severe suffering or punishment. It does not mean that they people who experience the **destruction** cease to exist. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: [ruin] or [disaster]
5:3	f1xr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ὥσπερ ἡ ὠδὶν τῇ ἐν γαστρὶ ἐχούσῃ; καὶ οὐ μὴ ἐκφύγωσιν	1	Paul is saying that **sudden destruction** during the day of the Lord is like **birth pain** because both events begin suddenly and cannot be avoided. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: [just as the birth pain comes suddenly on the one having in the womb, and just as she cannot escape from the birth pain, so they will certainly not escape the destruction]
5:3	iwc2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τῇ ἐν γαστρὶ ἐχούσῃ	1	Here, the phrase **the one having in the womb** refers to a woman who is pregnant. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [to a woman with child] or [to a woman who is pregnant]
5:3	undo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐ μὴ ἐκφύγωσιν	1	The words translated **certainly not** are two negative words. In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: [they will by no means escape]
5:4	sk6v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ὑμεῖς δέ, ἀδελφοί & ἐστὲ	1	Here, the phrase **But you** introduces what is true about the Thessalonians in contrast to what Paul has said about unbelievers. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that contrasts the Thessalonians with unbelievers.

5:4	b6lv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐκ ἐστὲ ἐν σκότει	1	Here Paul speaks as if the Thessalonians are not in a place that has no light. He could mean that: (1) they are not ignorant about the day of the Lord. Alternate translation: [are not ignorant] or [know about these things]; (2) they are not avoiding and disobeying God. Alternate translation: [are not disobeying God] or [are not far away from God]
5:4	fdiu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν σκότει	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **darkness**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [in dark places] or [without the light]
5:4	elp9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	καταλάβῃ	1	Here, Paul speaks of **the day** as if it were a person who could **overtake** the Thessalonians. He means that the event named **the day** will not surprise or shock the Thessalonians. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [might surprise] or [might startle]
5:4	ywez		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ἡ ἡμέρα ὑμᾶς ὡς κλέπτας καταλάβῃ	1	Paul is saying that **the day** of the Lord will **overtake** some people as sunshine overtakes **thieves** because both the people and the thieves are surprised by and unprepared for the **day** to arrive. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: [the day might overtake you as daytime overtakes thieves while they are stealing] or [you are unprepared for the day as thieves are unprepared for the sun to rise]
5:4	otz2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἡ ἡμέρα	1	Here Paul is again referring to what he called “the day of the Lord” in [5:2](../05/02.md). Make sure that your readers recognize that this is the same **day**, and express the idea as you did in [5:2](../05/02.md). Alternate translation: [Jesus’ second coming] or [the time when Jesus comes back]
5:4	o2ja		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ὡς κλέπτας	1	Paul is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You could supply these words from earlier in the sentence if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: [as daylight overtakes thieves]
5:4	iap8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	ὡς κλέπτας	1	Here, many ancient manuscripts read **as thieves**. The ULT follows that reading. Other ancient manuscripts read “as a thief.” This reading would mean that the **day** overtakes some people **as a thief** overtakes people and steals from them. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
5:5	ilv4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a reason or basis for what Paul has said about how the “day” will not overtake the Thessalonians (see [5:2](../05/02.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a reason or basis for a previous claim. Alternate translation: [In fact,] or [That is true because]
5:5	ddce		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	πάντες & ὑμεῖς υἱοὶ φωτός ἐστε, καὶ υἱοὶ ἡμέρας οὐκ ἐσμὲν νυκτὸς οὐδὲ σκότους	1	Here, the phrases **sons of the light** and **sons of day** mean basically the same thing. Also, the phrases **of night** and **of darkness** mean basically the same thing. Paul is using these phrases together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis by using a single phrase in each sentence. Alternate translation: [you are all sons of the day. We are not of night] or [you are all sons of the bright day. We are not of the dark night]
5:5	zp3z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	πάντες & ὑμεῖς υἱοὶ φωτός ἐστε, καὶ υἱοὶ ἡμέρας	1	The expression **son of** describes a person who shares the qualities of something. Paul is using this expression to describe the behavior and character of the Thessalonians, since they are people who are characterized by **light** and **day**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [you are all characterized by light and characterized by day] or [you all belong to the light and belong to the day]
5:5	o01o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πάντες & ὑμεῖς υἱοὶ φωτός ἐστε, καὶ υἱοὶ ἡμέρας	1	Here Paul speaks of the Thessalonians as if they were characterized by **light** and **day** (see the previous note for the meaning of the phrase **son of**). He means that they obey God and do what is right. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [you are all people who obey God and do what is right]
5:5	cxo9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	υἱοὶ φωτός & καὶ υἱοὶ ἡμέρας	1	Although the term **sons** is masculine, Paul is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that makes this clear. Alternate translation: [children of light and children of day]
5:5	f4uw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	οὐκ ἐσμὲν νυκτὸς οὐδὲ σκότους	1	Here, Paul is using the possessive form to describe how **We** are not characterized by **night** or **darkness**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: [We are not characterized by night nor characterized by darkness] or [We do not belong to the night nor do we belong to the darkness]
5:5	d6fm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	οὐκ ἐσμὲν νυκτὸς οὐδὲ σκότους	1	Here Paul speaks of believers as those who are not characterized by **night** and **darkness** (see the previous note for the meaning of the phrases **of night** and **of darkness**). He means that believers are not people who disobey God and do what is wrong. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [we are not people who disobey God and do what is wrong]
5:5	kq0x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἐσμὲν	1	Here, the word **We** includes Paul, his fellow workers, and the Thessalonians. Your language may require you to mark this form.
5:5	h4fd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	σκότους	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **darkness**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [of dark places] or [without light]
5:6	paqf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ἄρα οὖν	1	Here, the phrase **So then** introduces what Paul wants believers to do in response to what he has said about Jesus’ second coming. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the application of a specific teaching. Alternate translation: [Because those things are true] or [Now that I have taught you these things]
5:6	y36l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	μὴ καθεύδωμεν & γρηγορῶμεν	1	Here, both times Paul uses the word **us**, it includes Paul, his fellow workers, and the Thessalonians. Your language may require you to mark these forms.

5:23	os5l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ὁ Θεὸς τῆς εἰρήνης	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **peace**, you could express the idea in another way. Make sure that your translation fits the option you chose in the previous note about how **God** and **peace** relate. Alternate translation: [the peaceful God] or [the God who makes people peaceful]
5:23	nb1x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτὸς & ὁ Θεὸς τῆς εἰρήνης ἁγιάσαι	1	For emphasis, Paul is stating the pronoun “he,” which is already implied in the the phrase **the God of peace**. If your language can state implied pronouns explicitly for emphasis, you may want to use that construction in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. The ULT does so by using the intensive pronoun **himself**. Alternate translation: [may he who is the God of peace sanctify] or [may the God of peace indeed sanctify]
5:23	xvfz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ	1	Here, the word **and** could introduce: (1) a second blessing or prayer.

These three terms could: (1) describe different aspects of the whole person from different perspectives. In this case, the three terms do not define three separate pieces that together make up a person. You could use fewer or more terms to refer to different aspects of the person. Alternate translation: [your whole body and soul] or [your whole life, mind, feelings, and desires]; (2) describe three separate pieces that together make up a person. In this case, you should use two terms to refer to two different non-physical parts (**spirit** and **soul**) and one term to refer to one physical part (**body**). Alternate translation: [your whole mind, and life, and flesh]
5:23	gcy8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀμέμπτως	1	Here, the word **blamelessly** could refer to: (1) the situation in which the **spirit**, **soul**, and **body** are **kept**.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. See how you translated the similar phrase in [4:15](../04/15.md). Alternate translation: [when our Lord Jesus Christ comes back to earth] or [at return of our Lord Jesus Christ to us]
5:23	tzxf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμῶν	1	Here, the word **our** includes Paul, Silvanus, Timothy, the Thessalonians, and all believers. Your language may require you to mark this form.
5:24	i03k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	πιστὸς ὁ καλῶν ὑμᾶς, ὃς καὶ ποιήσει	1	Here, the clause **Faithful {is} the one calling you** gives the reason why God will be the one **who will also do {it}**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the relationship more explicit. Alternate translation: [Because the one calling you is faithful, he also will do it]
5:24	c3jg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ὁ καλῶν ὑμᾶς, ὃς	1	Here, the pronouns **he** and **who** refer to “the God of peace” (see [5:23](../05/23.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer directly to God. Alternate translation: [is God who calls you, who]

Alternate translation: [will do those things] or [will do what I have prayed for]
5:25	xxi3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	προσεύχεσθε καὶ	1	Here, **also** indicates that the Thessalonians should be praying for Paul, Silas, and Timothy just as Paul, Silas, and Timothy pray for them (see [5:23](../05/23.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: [just as we pray for you, pray also]
5:26	v9iy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ἐν φιλήματι ἁγίῳ	1	A **holy kiss** was a symbolic action to show familial love between believers. In some cultures, a kiss as a greeting is appropriate, but in other cultures it is not appropriate. The idea of a **holy kiss** is that it be a greeting that is appropriate in the culture, whether it be a kiss, a hug, a handshake, or something else, and also that it be holy, that is, appropriate between God’s people. If this would not be clear to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action in the text or in a footnote. Alternate translation: [warmly, as fellow believers]
5:27	xn0n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-oathformula	ἐνορκίζω ὑμᾶς τὸν Κύριον	1	The phrase **{by} the Lord** could be: (1) an oath formula. Use a natural way in your language to express an oath.

Alternate translation: [As one who represents the Lord, I solemnly charge you]
5:27	n5cn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀναγνωσθῆναι τὴν ἐπιστολὴν	1	In Paul’s culture, letters sent to a group were normally **read** out loud by one person to everyone else in the group. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: [to have this letter read by somebody out loud]
5:27	yp7e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀναγνωσθῆναι τὴν ἐπιστολὴν	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [to have someone read this letter]
5:27	pqkw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πᾶσιν τοῖς ἀδελφοῖς	1	Many ancient manuscripts read **all the brothers**. The ULT follows that reading. Other ancient manuscripts read “all the holy brothers.” If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
5:28	ykkr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing	ἡ χάρις τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν, Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ, μεθ’ ὑμῶν	1	As was customary in his culture, Paul closes his letter with a blessing for the Thessalonians. Use a form that people would recognize as a blessing in your language. Alternate translation: [May you experience kindness from our Lord Jesus Christ within you] or [I pray that you will have grace from our Lord Jesus Christ]
5:28	n8ur		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἡ χάρις τοῦ Κυρίου ἡμῶν, Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ, μεθ’ ὑμῶν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **grace**, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: [May our Lord Jesus Christ act graciously toward you]

Other ancient manuscripts add “Amen” after **{be} with you**. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
