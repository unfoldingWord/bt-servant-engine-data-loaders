Yahweh will destroy his enemies ([1:2–6](../01/02.md))\n1. Yahweh cares for his people and will destroy Nineveh ([1:7–15](../01/07.md))\n1. Nahum describes how Nineveh will fall ([2:1–3:19](../02/01.md))\n\n### What is the book of Nahum about?\n\nThe book of Nahum contains prophecies about how Yahweh would judge and punish Nineveh.\n\nNineveh was the capital city of the Assyrian Empire. The Assyrian Empire was very powerful and cruel. It was conquering and absorbing the kingdoms all around it. The Assyrians had already conquered the northern kingdom of Israel. They were threatening the southern kingdom of Judah. The audience of the book is the people of Judah. This book was to encourage their faith in God and to give them confidence that the Assyrians would be defeated.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\n“The Book of Nahum” or just “Nahum” is the traditional title of this book. Translators may choose to call it “The Prophecies of Nahum.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n### Who wrote the book of Nahum?\n\nThe prophet Nahum spoke these prophecies, and either he or one of his disciples wrote them down. Nahum was a prophet from Elkosh, an unknown city, probably in Judah.\n\nNahum mentions the destruction of Thebes, a city in Egypt, as a past event, which happened about 663 B.C. He prophesied about the destruction of Nineveh, which happened in 612 B.C. Therefore, the book of Nahum was written sometime between 663 and 612 B.C. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])\n\n## Translation Issues\n\n### Personification\n\nIn this prophecy, Yahweh often addresses the people of Judah and the people of Nineveh as simply “Judah” and “Nineveh,” using the names of the nation and city to represent the people. He also uses verbs in the singular that describe the nation or city doing things that people do, such as Judah wearing a yoke and shackles [1:13](../01/13.md) or celebrating festivals and fulfilling vows [1:15](../01/15.md). He describes Nineveh as a soldier who guards walls, watches a road, and strengthens his loins [2:1](../02/01.md), and also as a prostitute whom Yahweh will strip naked and cover with filth [3:4–6](../03/04.md), and as a drunkard who hides himself [3:11](../03/11.md). If it is not clear that these things describe the people as a whole, you could explain this in a footnote or use one of the ideas in [personification](rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification).\n\n### Short, unconnected statements\n\nIn the descriptions of the battle for Nineveh, Nahum uses short statements that are not connected to the rest of the prophecy. For example, it is difficult to tell who “He” and “they” are in [2:5](../02/05.md) or who is saying “Stop, stop” in [2:8](../02/08.md). There is no explanation of who the statements of [2:10](../02/10.md) apply to, “Empty and desolate and ruined! And the heart is melted, and a shaking of knees, and anguish {is} in all loins, and all of their faces gather beauty.” The statements of [3:1–3](../03/01.md) are similar. The reason seems to be that Nahum is reproducing in his description the confusion and anguish and the overwhelming of the senses that occurs in battle. Try to reproduce this effect in your translation in a way that makes sense in your language.
1:intro	fa8i				0	# Nahum 1 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nSome translations prefer to set apart extended quotations, prayers and songs. The ULT and many other English translations set the lines of the entire book (except for [verse 1](../01/01.md) of this chapter) farther to the right on the page than regular text to show that they are poetic prophecy. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]])\n\nDespite being divided into three chapters, this book consists of one long prophecy.\n\n### Outline of chapter 1\n\n1. Nahum introduces this book ([1:1](../01/01.md))\n1. Yahweh will destroy his enemies ([1:2–6](../01/02.md))\n1. Yahweh cares for his people and will destroy Nineveh ([1:7–15](../01/07.md))\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Yahweh’s anger against Nineveh\n\nThis prophecy should be read in reference to the book of Jonah. That book described how the people of Nineveh, Assyria’s capital city, repented when Jonah warned them that Yahweh was angry with them. The book of Nahum, written a little over one hundred years later than the book of Jonah, indicates that the Ninevites had returned to their evil ways and would soon be punished by God. Reading the two books together shows God’s mercy and patience and also his anger and judgment for cruelty, evil, and sin.\n\n### Complete destruction\n\nAt the time of Nahum’s prophecy, Assyria controlled almost the entire Near East. The Assyrians were terribly violent and cruel to the peoples that they conquered, including Israel. Because of this, Nahum prophesied that the Assyrians would be completely destroyed as a nation and as a people ([1:14](../01/14.md)). This prophecy came true very suddenly in 612 B.C.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Direct Address\n\nThe audience for this book is the people of Judah. They are in danger of attack by the cruel and powerful nation of Assyria, represented in this book by its capital, Nineveh. This chapter begins by describing Yahweh’s anger at his enemies and his love for his people. Then Yahweh begins to address Nineveh directly in [verse 9](../01/09.md) and continues to do so in various places throughout the book. The people of Nineveh are not part of the audience of this book, however. The address to Nineveh is intended to show the people of Judah Yahweh’s attitude toward the people of Nineveh and their evil actions. This direct address is also to let the people of Judah know that Yahweh will destroy Nineveh. Yahweh also addresses Judah directly in [verses 12](../01/12.md), [13](../01/13.md), and [15](../01/15.md).

2:intro	m3yl				0	# Nahum 2 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nIf you have decided to set the text of this book into short lines of poetry, you will want to continue to do so in this chapter.\n\nDespite being divided into three chapters, this book contains one long prophecy.\n\n### Outline of chapter 2\n\n1. Description of the battle that destroys Nineveh ([2:1–10](../02/01.md))\n1. Comparison of Nineveh to a lion’s den ([2:11–13](../02/11.md))\n\n## Translation Issues\n\n### Past and present for future\n\nIn this chapter, Nahum describes a battle for Nineveh in which the city is destroyed. He describes the battle and the resulting devastation of the city as though he is watching it happen, probably because God showed it to him in a vision ([1:1](../01/01.md)). However, the actual battle and destruction did not happen until many years after Nahum spoke this prophecy. If it would be helpful in your translation, you could explain this in a footnote, or you could change the verbs to future so that your readers will know that Nahum was predicting something that would happen later; it was not happening at that time.\n\n### Extended metaphor\n\nThere is an extended metaphor in [2:11–13](../02/11.md). In this metaphor, Yahweh compares Nineveh to a lion’s den and its inhabitants to lions who kill and devour their enemies. If this is unclear for your readers, you may want to provide an explanation in a footnote. (See: [extended metaphor](rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor)).

3:intro	k8ee				0	# Nahum 3 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nIf you have decided to set the text of this book into short lines of poetry, you will want to continue to do so in this chapter.\n\nDespite being divided into three chapters, the book contains one long prophecy.\n\n### Outline of chapter 3\n\n1. Woe to Nineveh ([3:1–3](../03/01.md))\n1. Nineveh the prostitute ([3:4–7](../03/04.md))\n1. The example of Thebes ([3:8–11](../03/08.md))\n1. The destruction of Nineveh is sure ([3:12–19](../03/12.md))\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### The Locusts in [3:15–17](../03/15.md)\n\nLocust attacks occurred often in the ancient Near East. A locust is a kind of grasshopper that would come in countless numbers. There would be so many that they would darken the sky like a black cloud that blocked the sunlight. They often came after a long period of no rain. They came down on whatever crops were surviving in the fields and stripped them bare. The locusts could not be stopped, and they caused terrible damage. For this reason, locust invasions served as a powerful image of overwhelming military attacks in the Old Testament.\n\n## Translation Issue\n\nThere is an extended metaphor in [3:4–7](../03/04.md). In this metaphor, Yahweh compares Nineveh to a prostitute who brings men under her control by charm and witchcraft. Both prostitution and witchcraft were associated with idol worship, and in the Bible, prostitution is used as a metaphor for idol worship. Just as a prostitute is not faithful to a husband, people who worship idols are not faithful to the only true God, the one who deserves worship. Nineveh was a very powerful and prosperous city, and thus,it was attractive to others to adopt Nineveh’s ways and to worship Nineveh’s gods. If this is unclear for your readers, you may want to provide an explanation in a footnote. (See: [extended metaphor](rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor)).
