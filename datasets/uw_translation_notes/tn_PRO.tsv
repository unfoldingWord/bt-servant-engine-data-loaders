Sayings from Lemuel ([31:1–9](../31/01.md))\n9. Description of a good and capable wife ([31:10–31](../31/10.md))\n\n### What is the book of Proverbs about?\n\nThe book of Proverbs is a collection of proverbs. A proverb is a saying that gives wise advice or teaches something that is generally true about life. Most societies have their own proverbs and may use specific language that indicates something is a proverb. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs]])\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nThe title of this book is often translated as “Proverbs.” A more general translation would be “Sayings for Wise People,” “Wise Sayings,” or something similar.\n\n### Who wrote the book of Proverbs?\n\nProverbs begins with the words, “The Proverbs of Solomon, son of David and King of Israel.” However, Solomon did not write all of the proverbs in this book. Unnamed wise men wrote the proverbs in [22:17](../22/17.md)–[24:34](../24/34.md). Agur the son of Jakeh wrote the proverbs in [30:1–33](../30/01.md) and King Lemuel wrote the proverbs in [31:1–31](../31/01.md).\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What is meant by “wisdom” in the book of Proverbs?\n\n“Wisdom” refers to understanding and doing what is true and morally right. A wise person understands and does what Yahweh considers to be right. Anyone living in this way will also learn to live well with other people and to make good practical decisions in life. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/wise]])\n\n### What types of fools are mentioned in the book of Proverbs?\n\nProverbs contains three different Hebrew words for a person who lacks sense. Many Bible translations translate all three of these as “fool.” However, most scholars think there is a slight difference in meaning between each of these words, each one depicting a different degree of seriousness of the foolish condition.\n\nTo reflect this difference, the ULT translates each of these Hebrew words with a different English word. For the most frequently occurring and perhaps mildest word in this group, such as in [1:22](../01/22.md), [8:5](../08/05.md), [29:20](../29/20.md), and many other places, the ULT uses forms of the word “stupid.” While a lack of intelligence may be implied by this word, in Proverbs it primarily refers to someone lacking common sense and morality. In Proverbs, a “stupid one” is someone who is lazy and thoughtless, but may be capable of learning to be wise.\n\nThe next word refers to a condition of thoughtlessness that many scholars consider to be worse than “stupid.” For this, the ULT uses forms of “fool.” This word refers to someone who is insolent and stubbornly continues to act thoughtlessly and immorally, such as in [1:7](../01/07.md), [7:22](../07/22.md), and [29:9](../29/09.md).\n\nLastly, the ULT uses the phrase “worthless one” for the most negative word in this group. This third term only occurs three times in Proverbs ([17:7](../17/07.md), [21](../17/21.md); [30:22](../30/22.md)) and refers to someone who is especially disgraceful and lacks any sense of morality whatsoever. This “worthless one” is someone who completely rejects God and refuses to do what pleases God ([Psalm 14:1](../../psa/014/001.md)). The UST uses forms of the term “fool” for the two most frequently used terms and uses “worthless people” for the third term. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/foolish]])\n\n### My Son\n\nSeveral parts of the book of Proverbs contain a series of proverbs addressed to “my son” or “sons” ([1:8](../01/08.md)–[9:18](../09/18.md); [19:27](../19/27.md); [23:15](../23/15.md)–[24:22](../24/22.md); [27:11](../27/11.md); [31:2](../31/02.md)–[31](../31/31.md)) This does not mean that all the lessons in those proverbs only apply to males. Rather, these phrases are forms used to pass on advice from a father to his son. Whenever the lesson of such proverbs is not specifically about common temptations of young men, the UST uses more general language that could refer to both male and female children. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations]])\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### Proverbs\n\nMost of this book consists of individual proverbs. A proverb is a short saying about something that is generally true in life. Proverbs often use parallelism and metaphors to teach a lesson by referring to something or some event that would be familiar to the readers. These proverbs say as much as they can in as few words as possible. Because of that, it is often necessary to supply words from the context in order for the sentences to make sense in translation. The Notes will suggest words that can be used where necessary. If possible, translate each proverb in a way that will be recognized as a proverb and be meaningful in your language and culture. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs]])\n\n### Parallelism\n\nMany proverbs consist of two parts that have a relationship to each other. The second part may strengthen the first part, give more details about the first part, or say something that is a contrast to the first part. The two parts are meant to be read as a whole so that together they say more about the subject than either part says by itself. Sometimes the second part seems to say the same thing again in different words. In this case, the second part reinforces the truth of the first part by repeating the message; It is not trying to say something different. Translators should also take into account that each proverb is also part of a larger group of proverbs. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])\n\n### Personification\n\nIn Proverbs, certain qualities such as wisdom and stupidity are often represented as if they were human. [Proverbs 1:20–33](../01/20.md), [3:15–18](../03/15.md), [4:6–9](../04/06.md), and [8:1](../08/01.md)–[9:12](../09/12.md) refer to wisdom as if it were a woman. [Proverbs 9:13–18](../09/13.md) might also refer to stupidity as if it were a woman. In languages where it is possible for a female figure to represent these qualities, the translator can translate directly. However, if direct translation does not work in your language, consider translating these personifications as similes instead. In that case, wisdom or stupidity would be presented as being like a wise or stupid woman. Alternatively, consider translating these passages without using figurative language, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])\n\n### Generic Nouns\n\nProverbs contains many generic noun phrases that refer to people or things in general even though they may appear to refer to specific individuals or things. This type of noun occurs frequently in this book because proverbs tell about things that are true about people in general. Most of the cases of generic nouns will be addressed in the notes. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])\n\n### Nominal Adjectives\nThroughout this book, Solomon uses adjectives that describe characteristics of people to refer to those kinds of people. For example, he refers to wicked people as “the wicked” and to righteous people as “the righteous.” When he seems to be referring to an individual rather than to a group, the ULT will represent this as “a wicked {one}” or “a righteous {one}.” Your language may work in the same way, or you may want to translate these as “wicked people” and “righteous people” or “a wicked person” and “a righteous person” or in some other way. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj]])
1:intro	y4et				0	# Proverbs 1 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. Introduction and purpose for Proverbs ([1:1–7](../01/01.md))\n    * Title ([1:1](../01/01.md))\n    * The purpose of Proverbs ([1:2–6](../01/02.md))\n    * Main theme: Fearing Yahweh is essential to being wise ([1:7](../01/07.md))\n2. A father teaches his son about wisdom ([1:8–9:18](../01/01.md))\n    * Avoid evil companions ([1:8–19](../01/08.md))\n    * Do not reject wisdom ([1:20–33](../01/20.md))\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Personification\n\nIn [1:20–33](../01/20.md), Solomon speaks of wisdom as if it were a person, specifically, as if it were a woman, because the word “wisdom” is grammatically feminine in Hebrew. In languages where it makes sense for a woman figure to represent an abstract concept like wisdom, the translator can translate the personification directly. If this does not work in your language because the word “wisdom” is grammatically masculine, consider personifying wisdom as a man. If it does not work in your language to represent an abstract concept like wisdom as a person, consider translating these personifications as similes instead. In that case, wisdom would be presented as being like a wise person. Alternatively, consider translating these passages without using figurative language, as in the UST. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

However, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional.

In languages where it makes sense for a woman figure to represent an abstract concept like wisdom, the translator can translate the personification directly. However, if direct translation does not work in your language, consider translating these personifications as similes instead. In that case, wisdom would be presented as being like a wise woman.

5:intro	jxf1				0	# Proverbs 5 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nAvoid temptation to commit adultery ([5:1–23](../05/01.md))\n   * The dangers of adultery ([5:1–14](../05/01.md))\n   * The joys of marital fidelity ([5:15–20](../05/15.md))\n   * Yahweh’s ways are better ([5:21–23](../05/21.md))\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### My son\n\nOccasionally, Solomon addresses a series of proverbs to “my son” or “sons.” This does not mean that those proverbs only apply to males. Instead, these phrases are forms used to pass on advice from a father to his son, and the kind of advice in these proverbs is about common temptations of young men.\n\n### Adulterous women\n\nThis chapter repeatedly warns young men to avoid any adulterous woman, whom Solomon calls “strange” and “foreign.” (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/adultery]])\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Euphemism\n\nIn [5:15–20](../05/15.md), Solomon uses several euphemisms to refer to sexual activity between a man and his wife or an adulterous woman. Although the UST expresses the meaning of these euphemisms plainly, only do so if sexual language would not be offensive in your culture. It is usually best to use a euphemism from your own language that means the same thing.

Instead, these phrases are forms used to pass on advice from a father to his son, and the kind of advice in these proverbs is about common temptations of young men.\n\n### Adulterous women\n\nThis chapter repeatedly warns young men to avoid any adulterous woman, who is called “strange” and “foreign.” (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/adultery]])\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nIn [6:9](../06/09.md), [27](../06/27.md), and [28](../06/28.md), Solomon uses rhetorical questions to emphasize the importance of what he is saying. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Animals used as examples\n\nIn this chapter, the gazelle, bird, and ant have certain characteristics which Solomon uses to teach about wisdom. If your language does not recognize those animals as being wise, you could add a footnote to explain or possibly substitute other animals from your culture that would help explain the same concept.

7:intro	pk5f				0	# Proverbs 7 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nMore Warnings about Adultery\n    * Being wise keeps you from adultery ([7:1–5](../07/01.md))\n    * The story of an adulterer ([7:6–23](../07/06.md))\n    * The lesson of the story ([7:24–27](../07/24.md))\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### My son\n\nOccasionally Solomon addresses a series of proverbs to “my son” or “sons.” This does not mean that those proverbs only apply to males. Instead, these phrases are forms used to pass on advice from a father to his son, and the kind of advice in these proverbs is about common temptations of young men.\n\n### Adulterous women\n\nThis chapter continues the theme about adulterous women and warns young men to avoid any adulterous woman, who is called “strange” and “foreign.” (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/adultery]])\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### The historic present\n\nTo call attention to developments in the story, Solomon uses the present tense in past narration in [7:8–13](../07/08.md) and [21–22](../07/21.md). If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense]])

8:intro	z8jj				0	# Proverbs 8 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nWisdom calls out again\n    * Foolish people can choose to be wise ([8:1–11](../08/01.md))\n    * Characteristics of wisdom ([8:12–21](../08/12.md))\n    * God used wisdom in creation ([8:22–31](../08/22.md))\n    * Rewards of wisdom ([8:32–36](../08/32.md)) \n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Wisdom calls out\n\nIn this chapter and the next chapter, wisdom is referred to as if it were a woman who calls out for all to learn from her. Wisdom is also pictured as a person who was with God when he created the universe. These are poetic ways of saying that God offers wisdom to all people and that he created the universe through his wisdom. In languages where it is possible for something like wisdom to be spoken of as if it were a person who speaks, the translator should translate in this way. However, if direct translation is not possible in your language, you may translate the personification as similes instead. In that case, wisdom would be presented as being like a wise woman. When wisdom speaks in [8:4–36](../08/04.md), the notes will use the proper noun “Wisdom” to indicate that the personification of wisdom is speaking. See how you translated similar references to wisdom in [1:20–33](../01/20.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

It does not refer to someone who misses another person in the sense of longing for that person to be present.

9:intro	y75r				0	# Proverbs 9 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nWisdom and folly ([9:1–18](../09/01.md))\n    * Wisdom invites naive people to a meal ([9:1–6](../09/01.md))\n    * Wise men become wiser but mockers will suffer ([9:7–12](../09/07.md))\n    * Folly invites people to her house ([9:13–18](../09/13.md))\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Wisdom calls out\n\nIn this chapter, as in the previous chapter, wisdom is referred to as if it were a woman who prepares a meal and calls out for all to come and learn from her. When wisdom speaks in [9:4–12](../09/04.md), the notes will use the proper noun “Wisdom” to indicate that the personification of wisdom is speaking. In languages where it is possible for something like wisdom to be spoken of as if it were a person who speaks, the translator should translate in this way. However, if direct translation is not possible in your language, you may translate the personification as similes instead. In that case, wisdom would be presented as being like a wise woman. See how you translated similar references to wisdom in [1:20–33](../01/20.md) and [8:4–36](../08/04.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

10:intro	fhy5				0	# Proverbs 10 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n### Outline of Proverbs 10\n\nGeneral proverbs from Solomon contrasting the benefits of being righteous and wise with the trouble that comes to those who are wicked and foolish ([10:1–32](../10/01.md))\n\nChapter 10 starts a new section of the book, which is mainly filled with short, individual proverbs that were written by Solomon ([10:1–22:16](../10/01.md)).\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Contrasting parallelism\n\nExcept for [10:10](../10/10.md), [18](../10/18.md), [22](../10/22.md), and [26](../10/26.md), all the proverbs in this chapter consist of two parallel clauses that contrast with each other.\n\n### Generic use of “righteous” and “wicked”\n\nThese proverbs often contrast the behavior of righteous people and wicked people. They usually refer to all righteous people simply as “the righteous” or “a righteous one.” In the same way, these proverbs often refer to all wicked people by saying, “the wicked” or “a wicked one.” Use a natural expression in your language that refers to any people who can be described in this way.

These proverbs continue to contrast the benefits of being righteous and wise with the trouble that comes to those who are wicked and foolish ([11:1–31](../11/01.md)).\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Contrasting parallelism\n\nExcept for [11:7](../11/07.md), [10](../11/10.md), [22](../11/22.md), [25](../11/25.md), and [11:29–31](../11/29.md), all the proverbs in this chapter consist of two parallel clauses that contrast with each other.

Or one object may be placed in one pan and a different object in the other pan; the pan that hangs lower contains the heavier object.

An object would be placed in one pan and these **stones** that had specific weights were placed in the other pan until the crossbar remained level, meaning that both pans contain an equal weight.

22:intro	t5zj				0	# Proverbs 22 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n3. Proverbs from Solomon ([10:1–22:16](../10/01.md))\n4. Sayings from wise men ([22:17–24:22](../22/01.md))\n    * Introduction to the sayings ([22:17–21](../22/17.md))\n    * The sayings ([22:22–24:22](../22/01.md))\n\nChapter 22 concludes the section of the book written by Solomon that is filled mainly with short, individual proverbs. Solomon wrote all 375 proverbs in [10:1](../10/01.md)–[22:16](../22/16.md). In [22:17](../22/17.md)–[21](../22/21.md), it seems that Solomon himself introduces a section of proverbs written by an unknown group of people called “the wise ones.” Most of the proverbs of “the wise ones,” found in [22:22](../22/22.md)–[24:22](../24/22.md), are longer than one verse. Each of these longer proverbs will be marked in the notes.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Parallelism\n\nChapters 16–22 mostly contain proverbs in which the second of two parallel clauses completes, emphasizes, or qualifies the idea of the first clause. Chapter 22 also contains contrasting parallelism ([22:3](../22/03.md), [12](../22/12.md)) and parallelism in which both clauses have the same meaning for emphasis ([22:1](../22/01.md), [24](../22/24.md), [26](../22/26.md)). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nIn [22:20](../22/20.md)–[21](../22/21.md) and [27](../22/27.md), the author uses rhetorical questions to emphasize the importance of what he is saying. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
22:1	kpvn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	נִבְחָ֣ר שֵׁ֭ם מֵ⁠עֹ֣שֶׁר רָ֑ב מִ⁠כֶּ֥סֶף וּ֝⁠מִ⁠זָּהָ֗ב חֵ֣ן טֽוֹב	1	These two clauses mean basically the same thing. The second clause emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the clauses with a word that shows that the second clause is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: [A name is to be chosen more than abundant riches; yes, favor is better than silver and than gold]
22:1	m8c7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	שֵׁ֭ם	1	Here, **name** refers to a person’s reputation. Solomon implies that it is a good reputation. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [A good reputation]

If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses.

25:intro	l94s				0	# Proverbs 25 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n6. Hezekiah’s proverbs from Solomon ([25:1–29:27](../25/01.md))\n    * Warnings and admonitions ([25:1–27:27](../25/01.md))\n    * Contrastive wise sayings ([28:1–29:27](../28/01.md))\n\nChapter 25 begins the section of the book containing proverbs written by Solomon that were copied by scribes during the reign of Hezekiah. This section contains two parts, the first part in [25:1](../25/01.md)–[27:27](../27/27.md) mostly contains proverbs that warn or admonish.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Parallelism\n\nChapters 25–27 mostly contain proverbs in which the second of two parallel clauses completes, emphasizes, or qualifies the idea of the first clause. Chapter 25 also contains one instance of contrasting parallelism ([25:2](../25/02.md)). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])\n\n### Metaphors\n\nSolomon uses many different metaphors in this chapter to warn his readers against acting unwisely. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

26:intro	juh9				0	# Proverbs 26 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n6. Hezekiah’s proverbs from Solomon ([25:1–29:27](../25/01.md))\n    * Warnings and admonitions ([25:1–27:27](../25/01.md))\n    * Contrastive wise sayings ([28:1–29:27](../28/01.md))\n\nChapter 26 continues the section of the book containing proverbs written by Solomon that were copied by scribes during the reign of Hezekiah. This section contains two parts, the first part in [25:1](../25/01.md)–[27:27](../27/27.md) mostly contains proverbs that warn or admonish.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Parallelism\n\nChapters 25–27 mostly contain proverbs in which the second of two parallel clauses completes, emphasizes, or qualifies the idea of the first clause. Chapter 26 contains only this type of parallelism. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])\n\n### Similes\n\nSolomon uses many different similes in this chapter to warn his readers against acting unwisely. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

It may be that we are to understand the command in [24:4](../24/04.md) to apply in some situations and the command in [24:5](../24/05.md) to apply in other situations. Or it may be that we are to understand **according to his folly** in different senses in the two verses, such as “Do not answer a stupid one with more of the same foolishness” in [verse 4](../26/04.md), and “Answer a stupid one who is saying foolish things” in [verse 5](../26/05.md).

27:intro	ec7g				0	# Proverbs 27 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n6. Hezekiah’s proverbs from Solomon ([25:1–29:27](../25/01.md))\n    * Warnings and admonitions ([25:1–27:27](../25/01.md))\n    * Contrastive wise sayings ([28:1–29:27](../28/01.md))\n\nChapter 27 continues the section of the book containing proverbs written by Solomon that were copied by scribes during the reign of Hezekiah. This section contains two parts, the first part in [25:1](../25/01.md)–[27:27](../27/27.md) mostly contains proverbs that warn or admonish.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Parallelism\n\nChapters 25–27 mostly contain proverbs in which the second of two parallel clauses completes, emphasizes, or qualifies the idea of the first clause. Chapter 27 also contains contrasting parallelism ([27:3](../27/03.md), [27:4](../27/04.md), [6](../27/06.md), [7](../27/07.md), [12](../27/12.md)) and parallelism in which both clauses have the same meaning for emphasis ([27:2](../27/02.md), [23](../27/23.md)). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])\n\n### Similes\n\nSolomon uses many different similes in this chapter to warn his readers against acting unwisely. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])

If you have chosen to refer to the person directly rather than to the eye of the person in this verse, you could also state the meaning of this part of the verse plainly. Alternate translation: [he will be eaten by scavengers] or [this person will be punished severely]

Roosters are male birds that walk around in a proud manner and some are trained to fight each other. Some have coloring that makes them appear to be wearing protective fighting clothing, which may explain the phrase **of loins**, which would refer to a man prepared for battle. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of bird, you could use the name of something similar in your area, or you could use a more general term.

Description of a good and capable wife ([31:10–31](../31/10.md))\n\nChapter 31 is the chapter in this book written by Lemuel, who wrote down the advice that his mother told him. Within the Bible, here is the only place that Lemuel is mentioned.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Acrostic poem\n\n[Proverbs 31:10](../31/10.md)–[31](../31/31.md) is an acrostic poem, that is, a poem in which each line begins with a successive letter of the alphabet in the original language. Using every letter of the language in that way expresses the idea of comprehensiveness and also helps people memorize the poem. In [31:10](../31/10.md)–[31](../31/31.md) the acrostic poem emphasizes that virtuous women demonstrate their virtue in everything that they do. If using the letters of your alphabet in this way would not communicate that this is a poem, you could use a different way in your language to indicate that these verses are one poem about the same topic.

You could supply these words from the context if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: [What should I say to you, my son? And what should I say to you, son of my womb? And what should I say to you, son of my vows?]

Alternate translation: [This is what I should tell you, my son! And this is what I should tell you, son of my womb! And this is what I should tell you, son of my vows!]; (2) exclamations in which **What** is not introducing a question. Alternate translation: [O, my son! O, son of my womb! O, son of my vows!]
