Exhortation to remain faithful ([1:6–18](../01/06.md))\n4. Encouragement to persevere ([2:1–13](../02/01.md))\n5. Instructions for opposing false teaching ([2:14–4:8](../02/01.md))\n6.

Letter closing ([4:22](../04/22.md))\n\n### Who wrote the book of 2 Timothy?\n\nThe author identifies himself as Paul the apostle. Paul was originally from the city of Tarsus, but he lived in Jerusalem. He had been known as Saul in his early life. Before becoming a Christian, Saul was a Pharisee, and he persecuted Christians. After he became a Christian, Paul traveled several times throughout the Roman Empire, telling people about Jesus. Eventually he was arrested and taken to Rome, the capital of the empire. After several years in jail, he was released. Sometime later, he was arrested again and, eventually, executed. Most likely, Paul composed this letter during this final time in prison.\n\nPaul wrote this letter to Timothy, Paul’s disciple and his close friend. Most likely, Timothy was in Ephesus during this time. Paul may have written other letters to Timothy; this is the second one that we still have. That is why it is known as 2 Timothy or Second Timothy.\n\n### What is the book of 2 Timothy about?\n\nWhen Paul wrote this letter, he knew that he would soon die. He wrote to encourage Timothy to continue serving God as a leader no matter what would happen to Paul. More specifically, he warned Timothy against false teachers, urged him to teach what is true, cautioned him about evil people, and asked him to visit. Throughout the letter, it is clear that Paul cared deeply for Timothy and wanted him to continue to serve God well even after Paul had died.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “2 Timothy” or “Second Timothy.” Or they may choose a different title, such as “Paul’s Second Letter to Timothy” or “A Second Letter from Paul to Timothy.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### Who were the false teachers?\n\nThe only information we have about who these false teachers were and what they taught comes from this letter and from the letters called 1 Timothy and Titus. These false teachers were Christians, or at least claimed to be Christians. They taught by using texts and stories that Paul considered unreliable, they spoke about and debated things that Paul considered unimportant, and they caused divisions and controversies. According to 1 Timothy, they told people not to marry and to avoid eating certain kinds of food. According to 2 Timothy, some of them taught that the resurrection had already happened. Since the only information about the false teachers and what they taught comes from this letter and 1 Timothy and Titus, it is best not to specify precisely what false teaching this was. You should preserve what Paul said about the false teaching without making it fit into a type of false teaching that might be familiar in your area.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### What did Paul mean by the expression “in Christ Jesus”?\n\nPaul uses the spatial metaphor “in Christ Jesus” seven times in this letter. This metaphor emphasizes that believers are as closely united to Christ as if they were inside him. Paul believes that this is true for all believers, and sometimes he uses “in Christ Jesus” simply to identify that what he is speaking about is true for those who believe in Jesus. At other times he emphasizes union with Christ as the means or the basis for some statement or exhortation. See the notes on specific verses for help in understanding the contextual meaning of “in Christ Jesus.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### What does Paul mean when he uses the word “faith”?\n\nPaul uses the abstract noun “faith” eight times in this letter. The word “faith” could refer to the act of having “faith” or to the content of the “faith,” that is, what it is that Christians believe. In many places in 2 Timothy, Christians have different understandings of which meaning Paul intended. In each of these places, a translation note provides examples of how to express the two possible meanings and the UST models how to express the idea when the word “faith” refers to the act of believing. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])\n\n### Who receives the “love” that Paul mentions in the letter?\n\nPaul uses the abstract noun “love” four times in this letter. He could mean that believers should love each other or that they should love God or that they should love both God and each other. If possible, though, you should express the idea so that it could include all of these possibilities. If you must express whom people are to love, it is recommended that you indicate that it is fellow believers. The UST models how to express the idea in that way. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/love]])\n\n### To whom does Paul refer with the words “we,” “us,” and “our”?\n\nPaul always uses the first-person plural to refer to both himself and Timothy, and he often includes other believers as well. So, you should always use the inclusive form of the first-person plural in your translation if your language marks that distinction. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])\n\n### When is “you” singular, and when is “you” plural?\n\nSince this letter is addressed to an individual, Timothy, every form of “you” throughout the letter is singular except for “you” in the final blessing in [4:22](../04/22.md). A note will point out this occurrence of a plural form of “you.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### What are the major textual issues in the text of the book of 1 Timothy?\n\nIn the following verses, ancient manuscripts do not all have the same words. The ULT uses the words that are found in most of the earliest manuscripts. When you translate these verses, you should compare the ULT with any translations with which your readers may be familiar, enabling you to see what your readers may expect. Unless there is a good reason to use the alternate words, you should follow the ULT. See the footnotes and notes at each of these verses for more information. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])\n\n  * “a teacher” ([1:11](../01/11.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “a teacher of the Gentiles.”\n  * “Suffer together” ([2:3](../02/03.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “You, therefore, suffer.”\n  * “God” ([2:14](../02/14.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “the Lord.”\n  * “and by his appearing” ([4:1](../04/01.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “according to his appearing.”\n  * “The Lord” ([4:22](../04/22.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “The Lord Jesus Christ.”\n  * “you” ([4:22](../04/22.md)). Some ancient manuscripts have this: “you. Amen.”
1:intro	p5lf				0	# 2 Timothy 1 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. Opening ([1:1–2](../01/01.md))\n2. Thanksgiving ([1:3–5](../01/03.md))\n3. Exhortation to remain faithful ([1:6–18](../01/06.md))\n      * Paul urges Timothy not to be ashamed and to preserve the gospel ([1:6–14](../01/06.md))\n      * Paul gives examples of unfaithful and faithful people ([1:15–18](../01/15.md))\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Timothy’s “gift”\n\nIn [1:6](../01/06.md), Paul speaks about the “gift” that Timothy received. He received it when Paul laid his hands on Timothy to commission him. It is clear from the context that this “gift” is a special skill or ability that Timothy had. Most likely, this skill or ability enabled Timothy to teach and lead believers well. Since Paul does not state or even imply what the “gift” was, you should use a general word or phrase that refers to a special skill or ability.\n\n### The “deposit”\n\nIn [1:12](../01/12.md) and [1:14](../01/14.md), Paul refers to a “deposit.” These two uses of the word “deposit” can be understood in two ways:\n1. In [verse 12](../01/12.md), Paul is referring to something he “deposits” with God, which would be his life or his eternal blessings. In [verse 14](../01/14.md), Paul is referring to something that God has “deposited” with Timothy, which would be the gospel or his ministry.\n2. In [verse 12](../01/12.md) and in [verse 14](../01/14.md), Paul is referring to something that God has “deposited” with himself and Timothy, which would be the gospel or their ministries.\n\nSee the notes on these verses for more information and translation options.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Spiritual children\n\nIn [1:2](../01/02.md), Paul calls Timothy a “beloved child.” By that, he means that Timothy is like a son to him in the context of their faith in Jesus. The phrase implies that Paul is a mentor to Timothy and that Timothy is a good student. Since the use of family language for fellow believers is an important metaphor in the New Testament, if possible, preserve the metaphor or express the idea in simile form. See the notes on this verse for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

He means that God will protect or preserve the **deposit**. What the **deposit** represents depends on what you chose in the previous note about who gave the **deposit** to whom.

Alternate translation: [to protect my true life] or [to preserve me]; (2) was given by God to Paul, then it could represent the gospel or Paul’s ministry.

1:13	p016		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὑγιαινόντων λόγων	1	Here, the word **words** represents things spoken using words.

Alternate translation: [You surely know that]
1:15	p018		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	πάντες οἱ ἐν τῇ Ἀσίᾳ	1	Paul says **all** here as an overstatement to emphasize how many believers turned away from him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different way to express the emphasis. Alternate translation: [most of the people who believe in Asia]
1:15	orui		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οἱ ἐν τῇ Ἀσίᾳ	1	Here the phrase **the ones in Asia** could refer to: (1) believers who are living in **Asia**.

1:15	p020		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀπεστράφησάν με	1	Here Paul implies that these people **turned away** because Paul was accused of doing what was wrong, and he was put in jail.

1:17	xfg1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλὰ	1	Here the word **but** introduces what Onesiphorus did instead of being ashamed of Paul.

Alternate translation: [And as much as he served in Ephesus, you know very well. May the Lord give to him to find mercy from the Lord in that day]
1:18	p3di		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing	δῴη αὐτῷ ὁ Κύριος, εὑρεῖν ἔλεος παρὰ Κυρίου	1	Here Paul again asks God to bless Onesiphorus. Use a form that people would recognize as a blessing in your language. See how you translated the similar blessing in [1:16](../01/16.md).

1:18	x2dk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	εὑρεῖν ἔλεος παρὰ Κυρίου	1	Here Paul speaks of **mercy** as if it were an object that Onesiphorus could **find**.

2:intro	k3zn				0	# 2 Timothy 2 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n4. Encouragement to persevere ([2:1–13](../02/01.md))\n      * Paul instructs Timothy in how to serve Jesus ([2:1–7](../02/01.md))\n      * Paul and the gospel he preaches ([2:8–10](../02/08.md))\n      * A trustworthy saying ([2:11–13](../02/11.md))\n5. Instructions for opposing false teaching ([2:14–4:8](../02/01.md))\n      * Paul instructs Timothy to teach what is right and avoid false teaching ([2:14–19](../02/14.md))\n      * God’s people as a house ([2:20–21](../02/20.md))\n      * Paul explains the traits that should characterize Timothy ([2:22–26](../02/22.md))\n\nIn [2:11–13](../02/11.md), Paul either quotes a poetic hymn or composes his own poetry. Because these verses are poetry, the ULT sets each line farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to distinguish them from prose. Consider how you might express these verses as poetry in your language.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### False teaching\n\nIn [2:16–18](../02/16.md), Paul refers to false teaching. He describes the teaching as “profane empty sayings” that lead to ungodliness. He further indicates that the false teaching can spread like an infectious disease and destroy people’s faith in Jesus. Finally, in [2:23](../02/23.md), Paul refers to “foolish and ignorant controversies” that cause debates and divisions within the church. However, Paul writes very little about the content of this false teaching. The only information he gives is that two men who are false teachers say that the resurrection has already happened (see [2:18](../02/18.md)). This could mean that everyone already has their resurrected bodies, that there is only a spiritual resurrection, or that people who are on earth have somehow missed the resurrection. Paul does not give enough information to know which of these options is what the false teachers were saying. So, it is best to refer to the false teaching in very general terms, as Paul does, without including any information that might be implied.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### The three illustrations in [2:4–6](../02/04.md)\n\nIn these three verses, Paul describes a soldier, an athlete, and a farmer. He describes these people as illustrations to show how Timothy should behave as a leader and teacher in the church. Since Paul tells Timothy to think carefully about these illustrations so that he can understand them (see [2:7](../02/07.md)), it is best not to explain the illustrations in your translation. However, if it would be helpful in your language, you could include footnotes that explain what the illustrations might mean. Here are likely interpretations:\n1. The soldier avoids becoming involved in matters of regular life. That way, he can please his commander. In the same way, Timothy should focus on pleasing Jesus. To do so, he will need to avoid becoming involved in many things that most people care about.\n2. The athlete can only be declared the winner if he or she competes according to the rules. In the same way, Timothy must do what God has required. Only then will he successfully lead and teach other believers.\n3. The farmer who works hard should receive a share of the crop before anyone else does. In the same way, if Timothy works hard to serve Jesus, he deserves to receive a reward. This reward could be payment and support from the believers he leads, or it could be the rewards that God will give him at the final judgment.\n\n### A house and the containers in it\n\nIn [2:19–21](../02/19.md), Paul speaks about a house and the containers within it in order to teach Timothy about the church. In [2:19](../02/19.md), Paul indicates that “the firm foundation of God” stands despite the false teachers. The firm foundation could represent the gospel, which is the basis for the church, or it could represent the church itself. In [2:20](../02/20.md), Paul refers to “containers” that are found within “a great house.” The implication is that this “great house” is built on the “firm foundation” and so, represents God’s people, the church. Paul then speaks about the “containers,” some of which are valuable and durable and some of which are cheap and breakable. The valuable and durable containers are used for honorable tasks, while the cheap and breakable containers are used for dishonorable tasks. The valuable and durable containers probably represent people who serve God well, while the cheap and breakable containers probably represent people, including the false teachers, who are failing to serve God well. Then in [2:21](../02/21.md) Paul urges people to cleanse themselves so that they can be like the valuable and durable containers. Since this is an extended metaphor that Paul partly explains in [2:21](../02/21.md), you should preserve the figure of speech in some form. See the notes on these verses for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### The poetry in [2:11–13](../02/11.md)\n\nIn these verses, Paul either quotes or composes a short work of poetry. Some scholars think that Paul is quoting part of an early hymn. These verses describe the union of believers with Jesus and how Jesus responds when Christians deny and are unfaithful to him. Consider what form your language uses for poetry and for hymns. If possible, express these verses using that form. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry]])
2:1	tajf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	σὺ οὖν	1	Here the word **therefore** could introduce: (1) an inference from [1:15–18](../01/15.md). In this case, Paul wants Timothy to act like Onesiphorus and not like Phygelus and Hermogenes. Alternate translation: [Like those who have not abandoned me, you too] or [In contrast to Phygelus and Hermogenes, you]; (2) an inference from most or all of [chapter 1](../01/01.md). Alternate translation: [Given all that, you]; (3) further exhortation to Timothy that is not based on anything specific. Alternate translation: [Now you]
2:1	bll5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τέκνον μου	1	Paul speaks of his close relationship to Timothy as though Timothy were his **child**. Paul means that he is Timothy’s spiritual father, and Paul loves Timothy in the way a father loves his child. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in simile form or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [who are like a child to me] or [my spiritual son]
2:1	p026		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐνδυναμοῦ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who does the action, you could indicate that it is: (1) God. Alternate translation: [let God strengthen you]; (2) Timothy himself. Alternate translation: [strengthen yourself]
2:1	e6ex		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν τῇ χάριτι τῇ ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **grace**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [in the way that God acts graciously toward you in Christ Jesus]
2:1	fc41		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν τῇ χάριτι	1	Here the word **in** could introduce: (1) the circumstance in which Timothy is **strengthened**. Alternate translation: [while you experience the grace]; (2) the means by which Timothy is **strengthened**. Alternate translation: [by the grace]
2:1	di28		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τῇ ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ	1	Here Paul uses the spatial metaphor **in Christ Jesus** to describe the union of believers with Christ Jesus. In this case, being **in Christ Jesus**, or united to **Christ Jesus**, is the way in which Timothy is given **grace**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that indicates that the **grace** is given to Timothy as part of his union with **Christ Jesus**. Alternate translation: [that is given in union with Christ Jesus] or [that you have because you are united to Christ Jesus]
2:2	ig9v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	διὰ πολλῶν μαρτύρων	1	Here the phrase **through many witnesses** could indicate that: (1) many people have witnessed or testified to the truth of what Paul has taught Timothy. Alternate translation: [that many witnesses have affirmed]; (2) Timothy has been taught by Paul in the presence of many people who can witness or testify to what Paul said. Alternate translation: [in the presence of many witnesses]
2:2	kv1m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ταῦτα παράθου	1	Paul speaks of his teachings as if they were objects that Timothy could physically **place** before other people. He means that Timothy should give these people the same teachings that Paul gave to Timothy. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [pass these things on to] or [speak these things to]
2:2	p027		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	πιστοῖς ἀνθρώποις	1	Although the term **men** is masculine, Paul is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that makes this clear. Alternate translation: [to faithful men and women]
2:3	yc1j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	συνκακοπάθησον	1	Here the phrase **Suffer together** could indicate that Timothy should suffer with: (1) Paul. Alternate translation: [Suffer together with me]; (2) all Christians who suffer. Alternate translation: [Suffer together with other believers]
2:3	vblo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	συνκακοπάθησον	1	Many ancient manuscripts read **Suffer together**. The ULT follows that reading. Other ancient manuscripts read “You, therefore, suffer.” If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
2:3	juu2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὡς καλὸς στρατιώτης Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	Here Paul speaks as if Timothy were a **soldier** who fights for and serves **Jesus Christ**. A **good soldier** is one who obeys his commander even if that means suffering and pain. So, Timothy will be like **a good soldier** when he obeys Jesus even if that means that he will **Suffer together** with Paul. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in simile form or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [as if you were a good soldier and Jesus Christ were your commander] or [as someone who faithfully serves Jesus Christ no matter what happens]
2:4	a4x7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	οὐδεὶς στρατευόμενος ἐμπλέκεται ταῖς τοῦ βίου πραγματίαις, ἵνα τῷ στρατολογήσαντι ἀρέσῃ	1	Here Paul continues to speak about a **soldier** to help Timothy understand how to behave. Just as a soldier focuses on pleasing his commander, so Timothy should focus on pleasing Jesus. To do so, he will have to avoid becoming **entangled in the affairs of life**. Since Paul tells Timothy in [2:7](../02/07.md) to think carefully about the examples that he gives in this verse and in [2:5–6](../02/05.md), you should not explain the meaning of this metaphor here. However, if it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that indicates that Paul is using a metaphor or giving an example. Alternate translation: [Imagine that you are a soldier. No one serving as a soldier is entangled in the affairs of life, so that he may please the one having enlisted him]
2:4	p7n5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐμπλέκεται ταῖς τοῦ βίου πραγματίαις	1	Paul speaks of **the affairs of life** as if they were a net that could trap people and keep them from being able to move freely.

He speaks about this to help Timothy understand how to behave. Just as an athlete will only receive the crown given to the winner if he competes **lawfully**, so Timothy will only be rewarded if he serves Jesus **lawfully**, that is, as Jesus desires. Since Paul tells Timothy in [2:7](../02/07.md) to think carefully about the examples that he gives in this verse and in [2:4](../02/04.md) and [2:6](../02/06.md), you should not explain the meaning of this metaphor here.

2:5	lea8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	οὐ στεφανοῦται	1	In Paul’s culture, when athletes won competitions, they were **crowned** with wreaths made from the leaves of plants.

He speaks about this to help Timothy understand how to behave. Just as this kind of **farmer** should be **first to share in the fruits**, so Timothy will be **first** to receive rewards if he works hard to serve Jesus. Since Paul tells Timothy in [2:7](../02/07.md) to think carefully about the examples that he gives in this verse and in [2:4–5](../02/04.md), you should not explain the meaning of this metaphor here. However, if it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that indicates that Paul is using a metaphor or giving an example. Alternate translation: [Now imagine that you are a farmer. It is necessary for the hardworking farmer first to share in the fruits]

3:intro	k2cr				0	# 2 Timothy 3 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n5. Instructions for opposing false teaching ([2:14–4:8](../02/01.md))\n      * False teachers in the last days ([3:1–9](../03/01.md))\n      * Instructions to Timothy to remain faithful ([3:10–15](../03/10.md))\n      * The nature of Scripture ([3:16–17](../03/16.md))\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### The last days\n\nMany Christians understand the phrase “last days” ([3:1](../03/01.md)) to refer to the entire time from when Jesus first came to when he will return, which includes Paul’s time. If so, then what Paul says about false teachers and evil people applies to his time, the present time, and the future. In contrast, some Christians understand the phrase “last days” to refer to a time in the future just before Jesus returns. If that is the meaning, then what Paul says about false teachers and evil people applies primarily to the future. Since Christians disagree about what time period the phrase “last days” refers to, if possible use a phrase that is general enough to allow for several interpretations. See the notes on [3:1](../03/01.md) for translation options.\n\n### Jannes and Jambres\n\nIn [3:8–9](../03/08.md), Paul refers to two men named Jannes and Jambres. These were the traditional names in Paul’s culture for two of the sorcerers or magicians who served Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. When God told Moses to tell Pharaoh to release the Israelites from slavery in Egypt, Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses by doing the same kind of miracle that he did (see [Exodus 7:8–13](../../exo/07/08.md)). However, later on they were not able to imitate the miracles that Moses did (see [Exodus 8:18–19](../../exo/08/18.md)), and they were even affected directly by one of the miracles that Moses did (see [Exodus 9:11](../../exo/09/11.md)). Paul compares the false teachers he is speaking about to these two men. Just like Jannes and Jambres, they oppose what is true but will eventually be proven foolish. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could include some of this information in a footnote.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### “God-breathed”\n\nIn [3:16](../03/16.md), Paul states that all Scripture is “God-breathed.” This is an important metaphor that indicates that God is the origin of Scripture as surely as if it were a breath that he had exhaled. This means that Scripture contains God’s words and is as true and reliable as God himself is. Paul does not mean that Scripture was not written by humans. Rather, Paul means that God enabled and guided humans as they wrote Scripture so that it truly is God’s words. If possible, preserve this important metaphor or express the idea in simile form. See the notes on this verse for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

3:1	g65r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν ἐσχάταις ἡμέραις	1	Here the phrase **last days** refers to the period of time before Jesus comes back.

Instructions for opposing false teaching ([2:14–4:8](../02/01.md))\n      * Paul gives a solemn charge to Timothy ([4:1–8](../04/01.md))\n6. Travel plans and news ([4:9–18](../04/09.md))\n7. Greetings ([4:19–21](../04/19.md))\n8. Letter closing ([4:22](../04/22.md))\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Paul’s situation and his defense\n\nIn this chapter, Paul writes about how many people abandoned him and failed to support him at his “first defense.” These people behaved in that way because Paul had been accused of acting against the Roman Empire. While he was waiting to defend himself at his trial, he was held as a prisoner, almost certainly in the capital of the empire, Rome. By the time he wrote this letter, he had already had his “first defense,” which was the first time he appeared in court to defend himself against the accusations. Paul implies that the judge did not decide what to do with him, so Paul would have to appear in court at least one more time. So, people abandoned Paul because they might also be arrested and accused if they stayed with him. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could include some of this information in a footnote.\n\n### Greetings\n\nIn this culture, it was common for those who sent letters to include greetings to and from others in their letters. In this way, many people could greet each other but only send one letter. In [4:19](../04/19.md) and [4:21](../04/21.md), Paul includes greetings to and from people whom he and the Timothy knew. Express these greetings in a natural form in your language.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Sports and military metaphors\n\nIn [4:7–8](../04/07.md), Paul speaks as if he were a soldier who has fought well and an athlete who has competed well. Just as athletes in his culture received crowns when they won, so Paul is sure that he will receive a “crown” from Jesus. Paul means that he has persisted in believing in and serving Jesus, even when it was difficult, and he is sure that Jesus will reward him for that. If possible, preserve these metaphors or express the ideas in simile form. See the notes on these verses for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
