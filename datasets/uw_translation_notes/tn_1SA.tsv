He anointed Saul to be the first king of Israel. Much of the book is about how Saul became king but then later sinned against Yahweh and died. Even while Saul was still alive, Yahweh chose David to be king after him. This book shows how God protected David when Saul tried to kill him.\n\n### What is the purpose of the book of 1 Samuel?\n\nThe book of 1 Samuel is the first of four books compiled by the prophets of Israel that together tell the story of the Israelite monarchy. The other books in this series are 2 Samuel, 1 Kings, and 2 Kings. Originally they were all one long book. The entire history shows that Yahweh was not at fault for the Israelites being conquered and exiled from their land. Instead, this happened because the people disobeyed Yahweh and broke their covenant with him.\n\n### Who wrote the book of 1 Samuel?\n\nIt is uncertain who wrote 1 Samuel. It may have been someone alive soon after King Solomon died. (Later prophets would have continued the story through the books of 1 Kings and 2 Kings.) After Solomon died, the kingdom of Israel split into two kingdoms. The author probably lived in the southern kingdom of Judah. A descendant of David continued to rule over the southern kingdom. The author may have written 1 Samuel to defend David’s right to be king. This would prove that David’s descendant was the rightful king of all the people of Israel.\n\nThe book of 1 Samuel makes two references to Israel and Judah, in [17:52](../17/52.md) and [18:16](../18/16.md). However, these references appear in the text in relation to events that took place long before the two kingdoms split apart. These references to Israel and Judah in the text suggest that the author wrote at a time after the kingdoms split. He wanted the readers to understand that all of the twelve tribes had originally supported David.\n\n### What title should translators use for this book?\n\nTranslators can use the traditional title “1 Samuel” or “First Samuel.” Translators may also consider another title such as “The Book About Samuel, Saul, and David.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n## Part 2: Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Book\n\n### Who is “Yahweh’s anointed”?\n\nThe author and characters in 1 Samuel often use the phrase “Yahweh’s anointed.” To “anoint” means to pour oil on someone’s head to show symbolically that they are assuming an office such as king or high priest. In this book, Samuel pours oil on Saul’s head to show that God is making him the king ([10:1](../10/01.md)) and he later pours oil on David’s head to show that God will make him the next king ([16:13](../16/13.md)). So the phrase “Yahweh’s anointed” refers to the one whom Yahweh chose to be the king of his people. Its use in this book would make later readers think about the future descendant of David who would become king of God’s people. This person who Yahweh chose would be known as the Messiah. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/anoint]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/peopleofgod]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]])\n\n## Part 3: Translation Issues in This Book\n\n### “And it happened”\n\nThe author often uses the phrase “And it happened” to introduce new event in the story or a new development within an episode. To translate this phrase in its various occurrences, use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event or development. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])\n\n### “behold”\n\nThe author and characters often use the word “behold” to focus their listeners’ attention on what they are about to say. While the word literally means “look,” the speakers do not want their listeners to look at something, but to pay careful attention. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### curses\n\nA curse is a strong statement that a person makes to cause bad things to happen to a person if that person does or does not do a certain thing. A curse usually has this pattern: “Thus may God do to you, and thus may he add, if you hide from me a word from all of the word that he spoke to you” ([3:17](../03/17.md)). Other instances of curses are found in [14:44](../14/44.md), [20:13](../20/13.md), and [25:22](../25/22.md). We recommend that you represent these curses in your language in a way that shows that they are strong, threatening statements.\n\n### “to this day”\n\nIn [1 Samuel 5:5](../05/05.md), [6:18](../06/18.md), and [27:6](../27/06.md), and [30:25](../30/25.md), the author uses the phrase “to this day.” He is referring to the time when he was writing. The translator should be aware that “to this day” refers to a time that is now in the past. He must avoid giving the impression that the present day of the translation’s readers is meant. The translator might decide to say “at the time when this is being written” or “at the time of this writing.”\n\n### “in the eyes of”\n\nThe author and characters often use the common expression “in the eyes of” to mean in someone’s estimation, opinion, or judgment. For example, Elkanah says to Hannah in [1:23](../01/23.md), “Do the good in your eyes,” meaning that she should do what she considers best. The author says in [8:6](../08/06.md) that “the matter was evil in the eyes of Samuel,” meaning that Samuel did not think that it was at all the right thing to do. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])\n\n### “to the face of” (before)\n\nThe author and characters often use the word “face” to represent the presence of a person or group, to represent the way people can see the face of someone who is present. The expression “to the face of” can have different shades of meaning, depending on the context. The focus may be more on the actual presence of a person, as in [17:57](../17/57.md), where the author says that after David killed Goliath, one of Saul’s generals “brought him to the face of Saul.” In other words, he brought him into Saul’s presence. The focus may also be on something being in front of or near a person or thing, such as in [9:23](../09/23.md), where the author says that Samuel’s cook took a special portion and “set it to the face of Saul.” That means that he put it in front of him as he sat at the table. Or the focus may be on the relationship between people or groups, as in [3:1](../03/01.md), where the author says that “Samuel was serving Yahweh before the face of Eli.” This probably does not mean that Samuel was always in the presence of Eli. Rather, it means that he served at the tent of meeting under Eli’s authority and supervision. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])\n\n### “into the hand of”/“into your hand”\n\nThe author and characters often use the word “hand” to represent power and capability. For example, when the Philistines ask in [4:8](../04/08.md), “Who will rescue us from the hand of these mighty gods?” they are asking who will deliver them from the power of these gods (mistakenly thinking that the Israelites worship a number of gods). The word “hand” may also represent possession, as when the author says in [7:8](../07/08.md) that Gideon’s soldiers “took provision into their hand.” The word “hand” may also represent agency, as when the author speaks in [3:4](../03/04.md) of the commandments that Yahweh gave the Israelites “by the hand of Moses.” Notes will help distinguish the difference between these shades of meaning when that may not be clear from the context. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])\n\n### “listen”\n\nThe author and characters often use the term “listen” to mean complying with what someone has said. For example, the author says in [2:25](../02/25.md) that Eli’s wicked sons “would not listen to the voice of their father,” meaning that they refused to obey him. Samuel says to Yahweh in [3:10](../03/10.md), “Speak, for your servant is listening,” to indicate that he is ready to obey whatever Yahweh tells him. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])\n\n### name of a person representing him and associated or accompanying people\n\nThe author and characters often use the name of a person to represent that person and others who are associated with or accompanying that person. For example, in [2:11](../02/11.md), when the author says that “Elkanah went to Ramah, to his house,” he is using Elkanah, one person who was involved in this action, to represent everyone who was involved. The text makes clear that Elkanah’s family accompanied him when he went to Shiloh. So the author means that Elkanah and his family returned together to their house in Ramah. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])\n\n### name of nation, tribe, or city representing its people\n\nThe author and characters often use the name of a nation, tribe, or city to represent its people. When a nation has the same name as its ancestor, this is the same thing as using the name of the ancestor to represent his descendants. For example, in [1:17](../01/17.md), when Eli speaks of “the God of Israel,” he is using the name of the nation of Israel to refer to its people, the Israelites. Since the Israelites were all descended from a man named Israel, Eli may also be using the name of an ancestor to represent his descendants. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])\n\n### “saying”\n\nThe author frequently uses the term “saying” to introduce a direct quotation. In your translation, use a natural way of introducing direct quotations in your language. It may not be necessary to represent this term explicitly. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])\n\n### “sons of”\n\nThe author and characters often speak of “the sons of” a person to mean the nation or tribe that consists of his descendants. For example, in [2:28](../02/28.md) a man of God speaks of the “sons of Israel” to mean the Israelites. In [12:12](../12/12.md), Samuel speaks of the “sons of Ammon” to mean the Ammonites. In this case, “sons” does not mean first-generation offspring but later descendants. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### “struck”\n\nIn many places, the author says that soldiers “struck” an opposing army, city, or king as if they had only hit them. But in various contexts, he means that they either attacked, defeated, or killed those opponents. For example, when the author says in [11:11](../11/11.md) that Saul and his soldiers “struck Ammon,” he means that they attacked the Ammonite army. When he says in [4:2](../04/02.md) that “Israel was struck to the face of the Philistines,” he means that the Philistines defeated the Israelites. And when he says in that same verse that the Philistines “struck … about 4,000 men,” he means that they killed them. Consider carefully how to translate the term “struck” in each context where it does not actually mean “hit.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])\n\n### “went up,” “went down”\n\nIn Hebrew, writers and speakers generally indicated whether people were going up to a higher elevation or going down to a lower elevation when they traveled. For example, the author says in [1:3](../01/03.md) that Elkanah and his family “went up” to Shiloh because they were traveling to a higher elevation. In [10:8](../10/08.md), Samuel tells Saul to “go down” to Gilgal because that would be a journey to a lower elevation. If your language does not mark travel for change in elevation, you can translate instances such as these simply as “went” or “go.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
1:intro	cj3l				0	# 1 Samuel 1 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter is the beginning of the first section of the book of 1 Samuel, [chapters 1–7](../01/01.md), which describe Samuel as a religious leader of Israel. This chapter tells how Samuel was born and how his parents dedicated him to Yahweh.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Why does the author use the name Ramathaim Zophim for Ramah in [1:1](../01/01.md)?\n\nThe author says in [1:1](../01/01.md) that Elkanah was from a town called Ramathaim Zophim. However, in all subsequent references in the book, the author uses the name Ramah for the town where Elkanah and later his son Samuel lived. The word Ramathaim is the dual of the word Ramah, which means “hill.” The city may have been built on two hills, and it may originally have had the name Ramathaim. This name may eventually have been shortened to Ramah, but the author may wish to use the original name for clarity and accuracy in his historical account. The author adds the term Zophim, meaning that this was where the descendants of a man named Zuph lived. He does this to distinguish this city from the three other cities in the land of Canaan that also had the name Ramah. In your translation, you could use the name Ramathaim Zophim and spell it the way it sounds in your language. However, if your readers might wonder why the author says in [1:19](../01/19.md) that Elkanah and his family returned to “their house in Ramah,” in [1:1](../01/01.md) you could use a description such as “the city called Ramah where the descendants of Zuph live.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])\n\n### Why does the author call the tent of meeting the “temple” in [1:9](../01/09.md)?\n\nThe author says in [1:9](../01/09.md) that the priest Eli was sitting by the doorpost of “the temple of Yahweh.” However, Yahweh had no temple at this time. King Solomon built a temple for him in Jerusalem many years later. It could be that this account was written or edited after the temple was built and that the author knew that his readers would understand that he was using that term to mean generally the place where the Israelites worshiped Yahweh. Alternatively, the author could have been speaking of the tent of meeting in elevated language. The word that is often translated as “temple” can also mean “palace.” The author may have felt that the place where Yahweh was present among his people deserved to be described in grand language as a temple or palace. However, if it would not be clear to your readers that in [1:9](../01/09.md) he means the tent of meeting, you could use the word that you have been using in your translation for that structure. The UST models one way to do that.\n\n### Why does Elkanah say “may Yahweh raise up his word” when Yahweh has not said anything?\n\nIn [1:23](../01/23.md), Elkanah says “may Yahweh raise up his word,” that is, “may Yahweh do what he has said,” even though the author has not recorded Yahweh saying anything. It could be that Elkanah is referring to what Eli said to Hannah in [1:17](../01/17.md), “may the God of Israel grant your request.” Elkanah would be considering that what Yahweh’s priest had spoken constituted a “word” from Yahweh himself. Hannah’s request involved not only her having a son but that son having a long life throughout which he was specially dedicated to God and effective in his service. Elkanah could be wishing that Yahweh would make all of these things happen. Another possibility is that the term translated as “word” could have the meaning of “thing” or “matter” in this context. In that case Elkanah would be saying “may Yahweh accomplish his purpose” for the child. He would not be referring to anything that Yahweh had explicitly said.\n\n### What “vow” did Elkanah make?\n\nIn [1:21](../01/21.md), the author says that Elkanah went to Shiloh to sacrifice a “vow.” He is referring to a sacrifice that Elkanah had promised to make, and he assumes that readers will understand what he means by this. However, he has not described Elkanah making a vow. The most probable explanation is that the previous year, Hannah had told Elkanah that Eli had said to her, “may the God of Israel grant your request.” Elkanah would then have made a vow that if God would indeed grant this request, he would offer a special sacrifice. Some interpreters suggest that Elkanah made this vow when, as [1:19](../01/19.md) says, the family worshiped Yahweh the morning after Eli spoke with Hannah. However, since the text does not state any of this explicitly, it would probably be best to express the meaning of the term “vow” without saying what Elkanah vowed or when. A note to [1:21](../01/21.md) suggests one way to do that.

2:intro	fe7v				0	# 1 Samuel 2 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the first section of the book, [chapters 1–7](../01/01.md), which describe Samuel as a religious leader of Israel. This chapter tells how Samuel’s mother Hannah celebrated his birth with a song. It also tells how the sons of the high priest Eli dishonored Yahweh by stealing from his offerings. This information leads into the action of the next chapter, in which Samuel has a central role.\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with Hannah’s poetic prayer in [2:1–10](../02/01.md).\n\n## Religious and Cultural Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Why did Hannah speak of a “king” when Israel had no king?\n\nHannah says at the end of her prayer that Yahweh will “give strength to his king and lift up the horn of his anointed one” ([2:10](../02/10.md)). Israel had no king at this time. However, the people may have been expecting that Yahweh might soon appoint a king for them. The law of Moses said in [Deuteronomy 17:14–20](../../deu/17/14.md) that Israel could have a king, and it described there what kind of person he had to be and how he needed to conduct himself. The enemies of the Israelites were trying to conquer their territory, and the Israelites were wishing for a king to defend them, as Samuel describes in [12:12](../12/12.md). It was the baby whose birth Hannah was celebrating in this prayer, Samuel, whom Yahweh told to anoint Saul as Israel’s first king and then to anoint David as a king who would obey him more faithfully. So it seems that Yahweh also gave Hannah prophetic insight into what he would soon do for Israel through her son. That is why she was able to speak confidently in this prayer about what Yahweh would do for Israel’s king.\n\n### What should have happened when people brought sacrifices?\n\nThe law of Moses said that when Israelites brought animals to Yahweh as sacrifices, they should slaughter the animal and cut it into pieces. They should lift up the breast and the fat to offer them to Yahweh and that a priest should burn the fat. The priest could then roast and eat the breast. The people would boil the rest of the meat from the animal. The law told them to give the right thigh to the priest. But the people could then eat the rest of the animal with their family and friends as a festive meal. The law of Moses also said that the people making the sacrifice should cut the fat off the meat and that the priests should burn this fat as a sacrifice to Yahweh. In this chapter, the author describes how Eli’s sons disobeyed these regulations and took more for themselves from the sacrifices than they were entitled to have. This was disrespectful and dishonoring to Yahweh, as a prophet tells Eli in this chapter and as Yahweh tells Samuel in the next chapter.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Poetry in Hannah’s prayer\n\nIn several places in her prayer in [verses 1–10](../02/01.md), Hannah speaks consecutive phrases that mean basically the same thing. The second phrase emphasizes the meaning of the first one by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry made frequent use of this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. It may be clearer in your language to connect the phrases with a word that shows that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. For example, in [verse 1](../02/01.md) you might say, “My heart rejoices in Yahweh, indeed, my horn is high in Yahweh.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])\n\n### Hannah’s use of the third person\n\nIn her prayer, although she is addressing Yahweh, Hannah speaks about him respectfully in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this consistently in the first person. For example, as the UST illustrates, you could say “you, Yahweh” rather than simply “Yahweh.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])\n\n### thunder\n\nA note to [2:10](../02/10.md) explains that in her prayer, Hannah uses the term “thunder” to speak of God’s impending judgment against those who oppose him. That note suggests that you could express the idea behind the term with a phrase about impending judgement. However, the author uses this same term “thunder” in [1:6](../01/06.md) to mean that Peninnah was trying to make Hannah so upset that she would lose control of her emotions. Hannah is saying here, in effect, “Be careful of trying to cause thunder—you might make Yahweh thunder against you!” So that your readers can recognize this connection, you may wish to retain the thunder image in your translation and use the same term in [1:6](../01/06.md) as in [2:10](../02/10.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Why does the author say “at the face of” instead of “to the face of” in [verses 11](../02/11.md), [17](../02/17.md), and [18](../02/18.md)?\n\nIn three places in this chapter, the author slightly varies the usual phrase “to the face of” and says “at the face of.” In [2:11](../02/11.md), the word “at” probably indicates that Samuel was serving Yahweh not just in the presence of Eli but together with him, under his guidance and direction. In [2:17](../02/17.md), the word “at” may indicate that Eli’s sons were not just committing a great sin in the presence of Yahweh but against him personally, against his honor and holiness. In [2:18](../02/18.md), conversely, the word “at” may indicate that Samuel was not merely serving Yahweh in his presence but with personal devotion. For each verse, a note suggests a way to express these possible meanings, and the UST models another way to do that. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])\n\n### The author’s reintroduction of participants\n\nIn this chapter, after Hannah’s prayer, the author alternates between describing the wickedness of Eli’s sons and the growth of Samuel into a godly young man. He does this to draw a contrast that shows why Yahweh ultimately chose to replace the descendants of Eli with a different line of priests and to have Samuel lead the nation. The author alternately reintroduces Eli or his sons and Samuel at [2:12](../02/12.md), [2:18](../02/18.md), [2:22](../02/22.md), and [2:26](../02/26.md), and he introduces the “man of God” as a new participant in [2:27](../02/27.md). Your language may have its own way of introducing or reintroducing participants that you can use in your translation in these places. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants]])\n\n### A long quotation within a quotation in [2:27–36](../02/27.md)\n\nWhen the man of God speaks to Eli in [2:27–36](../02/27.md), first he attributes what he says to Yahweh, then he communicates Yahweh’s message. As a result, there is a long second-level quotation (that is, a quotation within a quotation) in these verses. In [2:36](../02/36.md), it becomes a third-level quotation. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there it is all a first-level quotation. For example, changing the text of the ULT only slightly, in [2:27](../02/27.md) you might say, “Yahweh asks you whether revealing himself, he did not reveal himself to the house of your father in their being in Egypt, to the house of Pharaoh.” In [2:28](../02/28.md) you might say, “Yahweh says that he chose him from all of the tribes of Israel for himself for a priest, to go up on his altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod to his face. He says that he gave to the house of your father all of the gifts of the sons of Israel.” The UST models further ways of translating this part of the chapter so that there are not quotations within quotations. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes]])\n\n### A “faithful” priest or an “established” priest ([2:35](../02/35.md))?\n\nIn [2:35](../02/35.md), the word that the ULT translates as “faithful” is actually the same word that it translates as “established” in the second part of that verse and in [3:20](../03/20.md). Yahweh could be saying that Samuel will be an “established priest” in the sense that he and his descendants will serve “all of the days,” that is, perpetually, by contrast with the descendants of Eli. In that case, [3:20](../03/20.md) would be a confirmation of what Yahweh says here. However, the immediate context suggests that Yahweh may be using the same term in two different senses, as was common in prophetic speech, which often had poetic characteristics. Yahweh says that this priest “will do just as is in my heart and in my soul,” meaning that he will be loyal and obedient. That is why ULT translates the term as “faithful.” But the term really could have either meaning. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of ULT.

3:intro	riy2				0	# 1 Samuel 3 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the first section of the book, [chapters 1–7](../01/01.md), which describe Samuel as a religious leader of Israel. This chapter tells how Yahweh revealed to Samuel that he would judge and punish Eli and his descendants because Eli’s sons had dishonored him by stealing from his offerings. This chapter also tells how Samuel grew up to be a respected prophet of Yahweh.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### How did the tent of meeting come to have “doors” ([3:15](../03/15.md))?\n\nThe author says in [3:15](../03/15.md) that Samuel “opened the doors of the house of Yahweh.” While the Bible itself does not record these developments, it appears that during the time when the tent of meeting was in Shiloh, the Israelites built some structures around it or made some changes to it so that people entered and left through doors rather than through curtains. These structural changes or additions are not significant to the biblical story itself, so you do not need to call attention in the text of your translation or in a footnote to this change from curtains to doors.

The implication is that if the first part of the condition were met, something very bad would happen, so it is certain that the first part of the condition will not be met. You could indicate that meaning in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [The iniquity of the house of Eli will certainly never cover itself by sacrifice or by offering]

He is using the idea of covering to represent atonement for sin. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [Neither sacrifice nor offering will ever cover the iniquity of the house of Eli] or [No one will ever be able to make atonement for the iniquity of the house of Eli]

3:15	fea9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֶת־הַ⁠מַּרְאָ֖ה	1	By **the vision**, the author seems to be implying that Yahweh appeared visibly to Samuel when he came and said the things he records in [3:11–14](../03/11.md).

4:intro	a7dh				0	# 1 Samuel 4 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the first section of the book, [chapters 1–7](../01/01.md), which describe Samuel as a religious leader of Israel. It begins a story that provides background for how Samuel helped the Israelites genuinely worship Yahweh again. This chapter describes two battles that the Israelites fought against the Philistines. In both battles, Israel was badly defeated, and in the second battle, the Philistines captured the Box of the Covenant.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Why did the Israelites think they would defeat the Philistines if they brought the Box of the Covenant with them into battle?\n\nIn [4:3](../04/03.md), the elders of Israel conclude that the Philistines were able to defeat them because they did not bring the Box of the Covenant with them into battle. So they decide to bring the Box into the next battle. They may have been remembering that whenever the Israelites moved to a new place while traveling through the wilderness, when the priests would pick up the Box and begin to carry it, Moses would say, “Rise up, Yahweh, and may your enemies be scattered, and may those who hate you flee from your face” ([Numbers 10:35](../../num/10/35.md)). The elders may also have been remembering how Yahweh had told them to carry the Box around the city of Jericho and how the walls of that city had collapsed, allowing the Israelites to conquer it ([Joshua 5:6](../../jos/05/06.md)). The elders seem to believe mistakenly that the Box itself had power to help them. They say in [4:3](../04/03.md) that “it will save us from the palm of our enemies.” However, in the next battle, the Philistines defeat them again and capture the Box. Samuel tells the people in [7:3](../07/03.md) the real reason why Yahweh was allowing the Philistines to defeat them. He says, “If you are going to return to Yahweh with all your heart, remove the gods of the foreigner and the Ashtoreths from your midst. And make firm your heart to Yahweh, and serve him alone, then he will rescue you from the hand of the Philistines.” It was superstition for the Israelites to believe that a physical symbol of Yahweh had the power to help them. What they really needed to do was become wholeheartedly devoted to Yahweh, as Samuel ultimately led them to do.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Why do the Philistines say that the Egyptians were struck with plagues “in the wilderness” ([4:8](../04/08.md))?\n\nIn [4:8](../04/08.md) the Philistines say, in response to the Box of the Covenant arriving in the Israelite military camp, “These are they, the gods who struck the Egyptians with every plague in the wilderness.” This is historically inaccurate, since the ten plagues all happened in the land of Egypt, before the Israelites left and traveled across the wilderness. But the author may wish to show that the Philistines did not have accurate knowledge of the Israelites. By quoting them as saying “gods,” he is showing that they did not know that the Israelites worshiped only the one true God, Yahweh. By quoting them further as saying that the plagues happened “in the wilderness,” he may be showing that the Philistines also did not know the precise details of what Yahweh had done for the Israelites. (They just knew enough to be very afraid of what the Box of the Covenant represented.) So these inaccurate details are part of the author’s characterization of the Philistines, and it would be appropriate to retain them in your translation.

4:2	gqla		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יַּכּ֤וּ	1	The pronoun **they** refers to the Philistine soldiers. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: [And the Philistines struck]

They feel as if Yahweh himself has defeated them, and they believe the reason is that they did not bring the Box of the Covenant with them into battle. See the discussion in the Introduction to this chapter of why they believed this. The UST models one way to supply this implicit information.
4:3	v0mm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִ⁠כַּ֥ף אֹיְבֵֽי⁠נוּ	1	See the discussion in the Introduction to 1 Samuel of the use of the word “hand” to represent power. The elders are using the word **palm** here to mean the same thing. Alternate translation: [from the power of our enemies]

Alternate translation: [And the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were accompanying]

4:5	jezc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	וַ⁠יָּרִ֥עוּ כָל־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל תְּרוּעָ֣ה גְדוֹלָ֑ה	1	For emphasis, the author is using a construction in which a verb and its object come from the same root. You may be able to use the same construction in your language to express the meaning here. Alternatively, your language may have another way of showing the emphasis. Alternate translation: [that all of Israel shouted very loudly]
4:6	v05b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	אֶת־ק֣וֹל הַ⁠תְּרוּעָ֔ה	1	It might seem that the expression **the sound of the shout** contains extra information that would not be natural to express in your language. If so, you can shorten it. Alternate translation: [the shout]
4:6	wt8c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	אֲר֣וֹן יְהוָ֔ה בָּ֖א אֶל־הַֽ⁠מַּחֲנֶֽה	1	The author is speaking of **the Box of Yahweh** as if it were a living thing that could have **come into the camp** on its own. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [the Israelites had brought the Box of God into their camp]
4:7	aqm8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	וַ⁠יִּֽרְאוּ֙ הַ⁠פְּלִשְׁתִּ֔ים כִּ֣י אָמְר֔וּ בָּ֥א אֱלֹהִ֖ים אֶל־הַֽ⁠מַּחֲנֶ֑ה	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: [And the Philistines said, “A god has come into the camp!” and that thought made them very afraid]
4:7	n9n6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	בָּ֥א אֱלֹהִ֖ים אֶל־הַֽ⁠מַּחֲנֶ֑ה	1	The word that the ULT translates as **god** is plural, but the verb **has come** is singular. This suggests that as the author expresses the meaning of what the Philistines said in their own language, he is using the plural form to indicate greatness. Your language may be able to use a plural subject with a singular verb for this same purpose. If not, you could convey the meaning in another way. Alternate translation: [A great god has come into the camp]
4:7	vfm9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	א֣וֹי לָ֔⁠נוּ	1	The Philistines are using a phrase that expresses a strong feeling, fear. There may be an equivalent word or phrase in your language that you can use in your translation to convey this strong feeling. If not, you could say what the Philistines were feeling, or you could say what they were afraid of, here and in the next verse. Alternate translation: [Oh, no!] or [We are in great danger!]
4:7	xvqp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֶתְמ֥וֹל שִׁלְשֹֽׁם	1	In this culture, the current day was considered the first day, the previous day was considered the second day, and the day before that was considered **the third day**.

4:7	c83z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אֶתְמ֥וֹל שִׁלְשֹֽׁם	1	The Philistines are using **yesterday or the third day** as a common expression of their culture to mean “at any time in the past.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [in days gone by] or [ever in the past]

If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [We cannot imagine who could deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods!]
4:8	c02z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִ⁠יַּ֛ד	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [4:3](../04/03.md). Alternate translation: [from the power of]

This suggests that the author is showing that the Philistines were speaking here about multiple gods whom they mistakenly thought the Israelites worshiped. The Philistines apparently thought that one of these gods had come into the Israelite camp when the Box of the Covenant arrived. So it would be appropriate to use plural forms in your translation.
4:8	pwnq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	אֵ֧לֶּה הֵ֣ם הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֗ים הַ⁠מַּכִּ֧ים	1	It might seem that the expression **These are they, the gods who struck** contains extra information that would not be natural to express in your language. If so, you can shorten it. Alternate translation: [These are the same gods who struck]
4:8	vpdv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הַ⁠מַּכִּ֧ים	1	The Philistine soldiers are speaking as if Yahweh had actually **struck** or hit the Egyptians with these plagues. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [who afflicted]
4:8	g7qi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	בְּ⁠כָל־מַכָּ֖ה	1	The Philistines are making an overstatement for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the emphasis in a different way. Alternate translation: [with many terrible plagues]

4:9	qid0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הִֽתְחַזְּק֞וּ וִֽ⁠הְי֤וּ לַֽ⁠אֲנָשִׁים֙	1	The Philistines are using the term **men** to represent people who are courageous. The implication is that strong, experienced, full-grown men would be courageous in situations where weaker, inexperienced boys and youths would not. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [Strengthen yourselves and be courageous]
4:9	z8ey		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	הִֽתְחַזְּק֞וּ וִֽ⁠הְי֤וּ לַֽ⁠אֲנָשִׁים֙	1	These two phrases mean similar things. The Philistines are using the two terms together for emphasis.

Alternate translation: [So fight courageously]
4:10	smx6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יִּלָּחֲמ֣וּ פְלִשְׁתִּ֗ים	1	The author assumes that readers will know that by **fought**, he means that the Philistines fought courageously, as they told themselves they had to do.

If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [and they defeated the Israelite soldiers, who fled from the battle and left the army and went home]
4:10	lj3l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הַ⁠מַּכָּ֖ה גְּדוֹלָ֣ה מְאֹ֑ד	1	The word **striking** here is from the same root word as the verb that the ULT translates as “struck” in [4:2](../04/02.md). See how you translated the verb there. Alternate translation: [a very great slaughter]

4:13	efnm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מְצַפֶּ֔ה	1	Since the author explains in [4:15](../04/15.md) that Eli was blind, he does not mean that Eli was literally **watching** the road to see whether any messengers were coming. He means that Eli was waiting for news and hoping to recognize a messenger from the sound of his arrival. Alternate translation: [waiting]
4:13	lzqx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	הָיָ֤ה לִבּ⁠וֹ֙ חָרֵ֔ד	1	The author is using one part of Eli, his **heart**, to mean all of him in the act of feeling strongly.

He said of Eli in [3:2](../03/02.md) that “his eyes had begun to be dim,” that is, he could see objects only faintly. Now the cataracts had advanced to the point where his eyes no longer moved. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could name this condition explicitly in your translation. Alternate translation: [And he had severe cataracts, so he was not able to see anything]

Following the conventions of Hebrew poetry, he is saying something and then repeating the idea in different words. It may be helpful in your translation to connect these phrases with a word other than **and** to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: [I have just come from the battle lines, indeed, I myself fled from them today]
4:16	rzot		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	בְּנִֽ⁠י	1	Eli is addressing the messenger with a polite and gentle expression. Use a comparable title or expression for addressing someone politely and gently in your language. Alternate translation: [young man]

5:intro	qnq6				0	# 1 Samuel 5 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the first section of the book, [chapters 1–7](../01/01.md), which describe Samuel as a religious leader of Israel. It continues a story that provides background for how Samuel helped the Israelites genuinely worship Yahweh again. This chapter describes how Yahweh struck the people of Philistine cities with plagues when they put the Box of the Covenant in their idol temples.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### The Box of the Covenant in Philistine cities\n\nThe Philistines took the Box of the Covenant to the city of Ashdod and put it in the temple of their idol Dagon. That was a way of claiming that Dagon had enabled them to defeat the Israelites and even that Dagon was stronger than Yahweh. However, the large statue of Dagon in the temple fell down in front of the Box as if it were a slave prostrating himself before his master. That showed that Yahweh was actually much greater and stronger than Dagon. The people of Ashdod also began getting tumors, and swarms of mice began eating up their crops. So the people of Ashdod sent the Box to the city of Gath. But the same bad things happened to the people of Gath. So they sent the Box to the city of Ekron. The people there were so afraid of the Box that they did not want it there, and they asked their rulers to send it back to Israel.

5:2	kicv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בֵּ֣ית דָּג֑וֹן	1	The author is speaking as if Dagon’s temple were a **house** in which he lived. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [the temple of Dagon]
5:2	sjle		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	דָּג֑וֹן	1	The word **Dagon** is the name of a false god that the Philistines worshiped.
5:2	dntk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וַ⁠יַּצִּ֥יגוּ אֹת֖⁠וֹ אֵ֥צֶל דָּגֽוֹן	1	Placing the Box of Yahweh **beside Dagon** in his temple was a symbolic action by which the Philistines were asserting that Dagon had defeated Yahweh and thus his people, the Israelites. They were treating the Box of God as a trophy of victory. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: [And they placed it beside Dagon to suggest that Dagon had defeated Yahweh]
5:2	gfm2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	דָּג֑וֹן	1	The assumes that readers will know that by **Dagon**, he means the large statue of Dagon that was in the temple at Ashdod. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [the large statue of Dagon in the temple]
5:3	ajow		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יַּשְׁכִּ֤מוּ אַשְׁדּוֹדִים֙ & אֶת	1	Here the expression **arose early** does not necessarily mean that the Ashdodites got up earlier than usual in order to look inside the temple. While the author often does use the expression to mean that people got up earlier than usual in order to do an action he describes, for example, in [1:19](../01/19.md) and [15:12](../15/12.md), here and in the next verse it introduces what happened when the Ashdodites first got up. The UST models one way to express this meaning.
5:3	itx7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠הִנֵּ֣ה דָג֗וֹן	1	See how you translated the word “Behold” in [2:31](../02/31.md). Alternate translation: [and they found that Dagon]

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: [And the head of Dagon and the two of the palms of his hands were cut off, demonstrating how helpless he actually was]
5:4	roqb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	וּ⁠שְׁתֵּ֣י ׀ כַּפּ֣וֹת יָדָ֗י⁠ו	1	The word that the ULT translates as **hands** could indicate someone’s entire lower arms, so the author is clarifying what specific part of them had been **cut off**. Your language may be able to refer to this part more simply, and so this expression may seem to contain extra information that would not be natural to express in your language. If so, you can shorten it. Alternate translation: [and his hands]
5:4	p9oj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	אֶל־הַ⁠מִּפְתָּ֔ן	1	The author is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

5:4	dlqv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	אֶל־הַ⁠מִּפְתָּ֔ן	1	Leaving the **head** and **hands** of Dagon on the **threshold**, where people coming in and out of the temple would trample on them, was a symbolic action that expressed contempt for these symbols of Dagon’s supposed wisdom and power. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: [Someone had left them contemptuously on the threshold]
5:4	foy3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	רַ֥ק דָּג֖וֹן נִשְׁאַ֥ר עָלָֽי⁠ו	1	The author assumes that his readers will understand that by **Dagon**, in this instance he means the part of the statute that looked like a fish. The name Dagon comes from the word for “fish.” Fish symbolized prosperity for the Philistines, who lived by the seacoast. Statues of Dagon had a human head and hands but the body of a fish. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [The only thing left of the statute was the part that looked like a fish]

The author is using this phrase to refer to the time when he was writing. In your translation, make clear that the phrase refers to a time that is now in the past. Avoid giving the impression the phrase means “to the present day.” Alternate translation: [right up to the time of this writing]
5:6	mj3u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠תִּכְבַּ֧ד יַד־יְהוָ֛ה אֶל־הָ⁠אַשְׁדּוֹדִ֖ים	1	See the discussion of the term **hand** in the Introduction to 1 Samuel, and see how you translated the term in [4:8](../04/08.md). Alternate translation: [And Yahweh used his power greatly against the Ashdodites]
5:6	z4y2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יְשִׁמֵּ֑⁠ם	1	This seems to be an implicit reference to a plague that **devastated** the crops in the area. The description of the guilt offering in [6:4](../06/04.md) indicates that this was a plague of mice that came in great numbers and devoured the crops. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [and he sent a plague of mice that devoured their crops]
5:6	k09x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יַּ֤ךְ אֹתָ⁠ם֙ ב⁠עפלים	1	The word **tumors** refers to some kind of skin growth. The author distinguishes in [5:9](../05/09.md) and [5:12](../05/12.md) between people who were struck with this affliction and people who died, indicating that it was not immediately fatal. It could mean: (1) tumors, as in the ULT. (2) hemorrhoids. Alternate translation: [and struck them with hemorrhoids]
5:6	zspd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֶת־אַשְׁדּ֖וֹד וְ⁠אֶת־גְּבוּלֶֽי⁠הָ	1	The author is using the name **Ashdod** to represent the people who lived in that city, and he is using the term **borders** to represent “territories,” since territories may be defined by their borders. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [the people of Ashdod and the surrounding territories]
5:7	u3c2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	וַ⁠יִּרְא֥וּ אַנְשֵֽׁי־אַשְׁדּ֖וֹד	1	Here the masculine term **men** has a generic sense that includes both men and women.

6:intro	z9kg				0	# 1 Samuel 6 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the first section of the book, [chapters 1–7](../01/01.md), which describe Samuel as a religious leader of Israel. It concludes a story that provides background for how Samuel helped the Israelites genuinely worship Yahweh again. This chapter describes how the Philistines returned the Box of the Covenant to the Israelites in a way that confirmed that Yahweh had struck them with plagues to punish them for taking it.\n\n### The list of cities in [6:17](../06/17.md)\n\nThe list of cities in [1 Samuel 6:17](../06/17.md) is similar to the list of kings in [Joshua 12:9–24](../../jos/12/09.md). If you have already translated the book of Joshua, see how you formatted that list. You may wish to format the list here similarly.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Why did the Philistines send the Box back to Israel on a cart drawn by cows?\n\nThe Philistine leaders asked their priests what they should do with the Box. The priests said to send it back with an offering that showed they were sorry for taking it. The Philistines put the Box on a cart. They had two cows pull the cart, and they let them go wherever they wanted. Even though the cows had just given birth and were nursing their calves, they left their calves behind and walked straight to Israel, to the town of Beth Shemesh. This convinced the Philistines that Yahweh had indeed been punishing them with plagues for taking his Box. The people of Beth Shemesh sacrificed the cows as an offering to thank Yahweh that the Box was back in Israel.\n\n### Why did Yahweh kill many Israelites in the town of Beth Shemesh?\n\nYahweh killed many people in the town of Beth Shemesh because they looked into the Box of the Covenant. Those people had violated the sacred boundary around holy things that the law of Moses commanded the Israelites to observe.
6:1	pf03		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בִּ⁠שְׂדֵ֥ה פְלִשְׁתִּ֖ים	1	The author is using the term **field** to represent the territory of the Philistines. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [in the territory of the Philistines]
6:3	q7af		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	רֵיקָ֔ם	1	The priests and diviners assume that their listeners will know that by **empty**, they do not mean that the Philistines should put something inside the Box. They mean that the Philistines should send an offering along with the Box. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [without an accompanying offering]
6:3	skuy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	הָשֵׁ֥ב תָּשִׁ֛יבוּ	1	The priests and diviners are repeating forms of the verb **return** in order to intensify their expression of the idea that it conveys. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the intensification. Alternate translation: [be careful to return]

It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: [If you are then healed, then it will be known to you why his hand has not turned from you]
6:3	mv1e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	תֵּרָֽפְאוּ֙ וְ⁠נוֹדַ֣ע לָ⁠כֶ֔ם	1	If your language does not use these passive forms, you could express the ideas in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

Alternate translation: [he has not stopped using his power against you]
6:3	sabm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לֹא־תָס֥וּר יָד֖⁠וֹ מִ⁠כֶּֽם	1	Since the priests and diviners are stating what the result would be if healing followed the return of the Box, they mean that the Philistines would know why Yahweh’s had continued to make them suffer before they returned it. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [his hand has not turned from you before this] or [he has continued to use his power against you until now]
6:3	o64b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	לֹא־תָס֥וּר יָד֖⁠וֹ מִ⁠כֶּֽם	1	The priests and diviners are speaking of Yahweh’s **hand** as if it were a living thing that could have **turned** away from the Philistines by itself. If you decide to retain the term “hand” in your translation, if it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [he has not turned his hand from you] or [he has not withdrawn his hand from you]

6:4	pho8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	לְ⁠כֻלָּ֖⁠ם	1	The priests and diviners are using the word **them** to mean the people of Philistia. Since they are addressing those people directly, it may be more natural in your language to use a second-person pronoun rather than a third-person pronoun. Alternate translation: [was to all of you]
6:5	xpig		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הַ⁠מַּשְׁחִיתִם֙ אֶת־הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ	1	The priests and diviners are using the term **land** to represent the crops that the land has produced.

6:5	ttop		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וּ⁠נְתַתֶּ֛ם לֵ⁠אלֹהֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל כָּב֑וֹד	1	The expression **give glory to the God of Israel** means that by sending these gifts, the Philistines will vindicate the justice of Yahweh by acknowledging that it was wrong for them to take his Box and that he was justified in punishing them with these plagues for doing that. See the similar use of this phrase in [Joshua 7:19](../../jos/07/19.md). Alternate translation: [and in that way you will be admitting to the God of Israel that you did wrong and that he was justified in punishing you with these plagues]

If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [So you should not make your heart heavy, just as the Egyptians and Pharaoh made their heart heavy! When he dealt severely with them, they certainly sent them away, and they went!]
6:6	w0h1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	אֶת־לְבַבְ⁠כֶ֔ם & אֶת־לִבָּ֑⁠ם	1	Since the priests and diviners are referring to groups of people, the Philistines whom they are addressing and the Egyptians whom they are describing it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **heart** in both instances. Alternate translation: [your hearts … their hearts]

It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: [When Yahweh dealt severely with the Egyptians, did the Egyptians not send the Israelites away, and the Israelites went?]
6:7	pfzk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וְ⁠עַתָּ֗ה	1	The phrase translated as **And now** was an expression that speakers in this culture commonly used to introduce their main topic If your language has a comparable expression that it uses for this same purpose, you can use it in your translation. If not, you do not have to translate this phrase explicitly. You could indicate in some other way that this was the main point that the Philistine priests wanted to make. The UST models one way to do that.
6:7	fn2q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	קְח֨וּ וַ⁠עֲשׂ֜וּ עֲגָלָ֤ה חֲדָשָׁה֙ אֶחָ֔ת וּ⁠שְׁתֵּ֤י פָרוֹת֙ עָל֔וֹת אֲשֶׁ֛ר לֹא־עָלָ֥ה עֲלֵי⁠הֶ֖ם עֹ֑ל	1	Putting the sacred Box on a cart that had never been used for any other purpose, and having cows pull the cart that had never done pulling work before, were symbolic actions that treated the Box with special reverence. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of these actions. Alternate translation: [in order to treat the Box of the God of Israel with special reverence, take and make one new cart, and two nursing cows upon which a yoke has not gone up]
6:7	tyk1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	קְח֨וּ וַ⁠עֲשׂ֜וּ	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **take** tells in what way the priests and diviners wanted the Philistines to **make** this cart. They do not mean that they want the Philistines to take it somewhere before making it. Rather, the word **take** has the sense of “undertake,” of taking measures to accomplish something. Alternate translation: [carefully make] or [prepare]
6:7	okot		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וּ⁠שְׁתֵּ֤י פָרוֹת֙ עָל֔וֹת	1	The priests and diviners are leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

6:7	w82s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הַ⁠בָּֽיְתָ⁠ה	1	While in this culture people sometimes did keep animals in a lower area of the house in which they lived, in this context, the term **house** probably refers to a stall or pen. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [to their stalls]
6:8	ske9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠שִׁלַּחְתֶּ֥ם אֹת֖⁠וֹ וְ⁠הָלָֽךְ	1	The pronoun **it** refers in both instances to the **cart**. But since the cart would not be able to **go** anywhere by itself, the priests and diviners mean that the Philistines are to let the cows pulling the cart go in any direction they wish. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a plural pronoun instead that would refer back to the cows described in the previous verse. Alternate translation: [And you shall send them away, that they may go]
6:9	q95r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אִם־דֶּ֨רֶךְ גְּבוּל֤⁠וֹ יַֽעֲלֶה֙	1	As in the previous verse, the pronoun **it** refers to the cart that the cows will be pulling, while the pronoun **its** refers to the Box of Yahweh. If you used plural pronouns in the previous verse to refer to the cows rather than the cart, you can do the same thing here. Alternate translation: [if they go up the way of its border] or [if the cows pull the cart back up to the place where the Box belongs]
6:9	ioqi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	אִם & יַֽעֲלֶה֙	1	As the author reports in his own language what the Philistine priests and diviners said, he characteristically marks this travel description for change in elevation by saying **up**. See the discussion of this in the Introduction to 1 Samuel, and see how you translated the comparable expression in [1:3](../01/03.md). Alternate translation: [if it goes] or [if they go]
6:9	kqij		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	גְּבוּל֤⁠וֹ	1	The priests and diviners are using the term **border** to represent “territory,” since a territory is enclosed by borders.

6:9	ycy9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠אִם־לֹ֗א	1	The priests and diviners are leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

6:10	zroy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בַ⁠בָּֽיִת	1	See how you translated the term **house** in [6:7](../06/07.md). Alternate translation: [in their stalls]

You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. The UST models one way to do that.
6:12	d5d6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	יָמִ֣ין וּ⁠שְׂמֹ֑אול	1	The author is speaking of two directions in order to mean them and everything in between.

6:13	sm9g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וּ⁠בֵ֣ית שֶׁ֔מֶשׁ קֹצְרִ֥ים	1	As the plural pronouns in the next sentence show, the author is using the name **Beth Shemesh** to represent the people who lived in that town. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation, as in the UST: [Now the people of Beth Shemesh were harvesting]
6:13	n0yj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּשְׂא֣וּ אֶת־עֵינֵי⁠הֶ֗ם	1	The author is using a common expression of his culture to mean that the people of Beth Shemesh looked off into the distance.

6:13	fgip		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יִּשְׂא֣וּ אֶת־עֵינֵי⁠הֶ֗ם	1	The author means that the people did this when they heard the cows mooing loudly as they pulled the cart down the road toward them. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [And they heard cows mooing loudly as they pulled a cart, so they looked off into the distance to see what was happening]
6:14	ntni		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	יְהוֹשֻׁ֤עַ בֵּֽית־הַשִּׁמְשִׁי֙	1	The word **Bethshemite** describes a person from the town of Beth Shemesh.

In effect, he is describing one event before describing another event that preceded it. In your translation, you may wish to relate these events in the order in which they happened. You could do that by creating a verse bridge. The UST models one way to do that.

You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [and having seen all they needed to see to be convinced that Yahweh had caused the plagues, they returned to Ekron without staying in Israel any longer]

6:18	mmi3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	מֵ⁠עִ֣יר מִבְצָ֔ר וְ⁠עַ֖ד כֹּ֣פֶר הַ⁠פְּרָזִ֑י	1	The author is not referring to a specific **city** or **village**. He means the Philistine cities and villages in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using plural forms. Alternate translation: [from the cities of fortification and to the villages of the countryside]
6:18	y8ns		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	מֵ⁠עִ֣יר מִבְצָ֔ר	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **fortification**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [from the fortified cities]
6:18	l9t1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠עַ֣ד ׀ אָבֵ֣ל הַ⁠גְּדוֹלָ֗ה	1	The author assumes that his readers will know that the “great stone” he first mentioned in [6:14](../06/14.md) was later given the name **Abel**, which means “mourning.” The stone probably got that name because of the events that the author describes in the next verse, because of which, he says, the people “mourned.” You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [and as far as the great stone that came to be called Abel]
6:18	poam		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠עַ֣ד ׀ אָבֵ֣ל הַ⁠גְּדוֹלָ֗ה	1	The context suggests that this stone marked the boundary between the territories of the Philistines and the Israelites.

6:19	m1jj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	שִׁבְעִ֣ים אִ֔ישׁ חֲמִשִּׁ֥ים אֶ֖לֶף אִ֑ישׁ	1	Most Hebrew manuscripts, including the most ancient ones, have the reading that the ULT follows here. A few manuscripts read simply “70 men,” fits the Hebrew grammar better. It also suits the historical context better, since Beth Shemesh was only a town. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.

If a speaker of your language would not use that form for that purpose, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: [No one is able to stand to the face of Yahweh, this holy God! He must go up from us to someone else!]

6:20	ug76		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠אֶל־מִ֖י יַעֲלֶ֥ה מֵ⁠עָלֵֽי⁠נוּ	1	The people of Beth Shemesh are using the pronoun **he**, meaning Yahweh, to represent the Box of Yahweh, in which they recognize him to be present in a special way. From their perspective, if they send the Box away, that will be like Yahweh leaving them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [And to whom can we send Yahweh’s Box from here]
7:intro	hd2a				0	# 1 Samuel 7 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter concludes the section of the book that is dedicated primarily to describing Samuel as a leader of Israel. It has three main parts.\n\nThe first part continues a story that begins in [6:19](../06/19.md). It includes [7:1–2](../07/01.md). It tells the story of how the Box of Yahweh was moved from Beth Shemesh to Kiriath Jearim. (There is a chapter break in the middle of the story. However, the chapter divisions were added to the Bible many centuries after it was written, and they do not always correspond to the natural literary structure of its books. Be sure that it is clear in your translation that [6:19–7:2](../06/01.md) is a single story.)\n\nThe second part, [7:3–14](../07/03.md), then tells the story of how Samuel led the Israelites to rededicate themselves to Yahweh so that they could defeat the Philistines and recover territory that the Philistines had captured from them.\n\nThe third part, [7:15–17](../07/15.md), then concludes the story of Samuel as the leader of Israel by giving a general summary of his activities.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Pouring out water on the ground\n\nIn [7:6](../07/06.md), the Israelites draw water from a well and pour it onto the ground in the presence of Yahweh. This was a symbolic action, but its significance is not entirely clear, since this action occurs nowhere else in the Bible. It may have been symbolic of the Israelites pouring out their hearts to Yahweh in repentance. It may also have been a way in which the Israelites acknowledged their own weakness and powerlessness, portraying themselves as like “water spilled upon the ground, which cannot be gathered” up again (as the Bible says in [2 Samuel 14:14](../../2sa/14/14.md)). Since the meaning is not clear, it would probably best not to suggest the significance of the action in the text of your translation. However, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could describe these possibilities in a footnote.\n\n### Sacrificing a young lamb\n\nIn [7:9](../07/09.md), Samuel sacrifices a very young lamb as a whole burnt offering as he is praying and asking Yahweh to help the Israelites defeat the Philistines. The choice of this animal for a sacrifice seems to have been symbolic. Some interpreters have suggested that it represented the nation of Israel as if it were new-born as a result of its rededication to Yahweh. Other interpreters have suggested that a very young animal could represent a pure and innocent sacrifice. In this case as well, since the meaning is not clear, it would probably best not to suggest the significance of the action in the text of your translation. But if it would be helpful to your readers, you could describe these possibilities in a footnote.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### The significance of the name Beth Kar\n\nIn [7:11](../07/11.md), the author says that the Israelites pursued and killed the fleeing Philistines “unto below Beth Kar.” This suggests that suggests that Beth Kar was the name of a settlement that was built on a hill. The fleeing Philistine soldiers were apparently able to find safety on this height, and so the Israelites soldiers ended their pursuit there. The word “Kar” means “lamb” in Hebrew, and one possibility is that the Israelites gave the name Beth Kar, “House of the Lamb,” to this place after the battle, alluding to the lamb that Samuel had sacrificed while asking Yahweh to help the Israelites defeat the Philistines. You could reflect this possibility in your translation by saying something like “as far as the bottom of the hill that the Israelites later called Beth Kar” and explaining the meaning of the name in a footnote. However, it is significant that while the author explains the meaning of the name Ebenezer in the next verse, he does not explain the meaning of the name Beth Kar here. Accordingly, you may wish simply to express the name Beth Kar in your translation, spelling it the way it sounds in your language, and not say anything about when the place got this name or what it means.
7:1	akuv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	אֶל־בֵּ֥ית אֲבִינָדָ֖ב בַּ⁠גִּבְעָ֑ה	1	The men of Kiriath Jearim probably took the Box to this **house** on a **hill** in order to show honor and respect to Yahweh through the symbolic action of placing his Box in a high and secure location. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: [respectfully to the house of Abinadab on the hill, where it was high and secure]
7:1	j996		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בַּ⁠גִּבְעָ֑ה	1	The author assumes that his readers will know that by **on the hill**, he means a certain hill within the city of Kiriath Jearim. Since modern readers would not recognize the identity of this hill, it may be more natural to speak of it in more general terms. Alternate translation: [which was on a hill]
7:2	hqzw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֗י	1	The author is using this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event.

7:2	kneo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	כָּל־בֵּ֥ית יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל	1	Here, **house** means all the people descended from a particular person. It envisions them as if they were one household living together. So **the house of Israel** figuratively means all the people descended from the patriarch Jacob, who was also known as Israel. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [all of the Israelites]
7:2	ssl0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	כָּל־בֵּ֥ית יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל	1	The author is making an overstatement for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the emphasis in a different way. Alternate translation: [people throughout Israel]

7:3	zuht		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	אֶת־אֱלֹהֵ֧י הַ⁠נֵּכָ֛ר	1	Samuel is not referring to a specific **foreigner**. He means foreigners in general.

8:intro	ek6j				0	# 1 Samuel 8 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter begins a new part of the story. The focus of the book shifts from Samuel, who led Israel as a prophet and judge, to Saul, who led Israel as its first king. This section includes [chapters 8–15](../08/01.md). Chapter 8 describes how the people of Israel asked Samuel to appoint a king for them and Yahweh told him to agree. But Yahweh also told Samuel that the people’s request showed a lack of trust in him and that he should warn the people about how the king would exploit them.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### The kingship in Israel\n\nThe law of Moses provided for Israel to have a king. [Deuteronomy 17:14–20](../../deu/17/14.md) described what kind of person this king needed to be and how he had to behave. But in these circumstances, the people had asked for a king for reasons other than the ones for which the law provided for one. [1 Samuel 12:12](../12/12.md) shows that the Israelites were afraid because the army of the Ammonite king Nahash was trying to conquer their territories. They asked Samuel for a king who would “go out … and fight our battles.” They wanted a king who was physically powerful and aggressive. Samuel warned them that a king of that kind would oppress them. But the people still wanted a king to lead their armies. They no longer trusted God to deliver them from their enemies, as he had done repeatedly during the time of Joshua and the judges. So while the kingship was not wrong in itself, the people’s motives for asking for this kind of king in these circumstances were wrong.

9:intro	kus3				0	# 1 Samuel 9 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the section of the book about Saul. It describes how Yahweh led Saul to come to the city where Samuel lived so that Samuel could tell him that Yahweh had chosen him to be the king of Israel.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### The locations of Shalishah and Shaalim\n\nSaul came to Samuel’s city because he had looking for some donkeys that belonged to his father and had wandered away. In [9:4](../09/04.md), the author describes Saul passing through “the land of Shalishah” and “the land of Shaalim” as he searches for these donkeys. The locations of these places are no longer certain. We recommend that you simply use these names in your translation, spelling them the way they sound in your language, without suggesting any further identifying information about these places.
9:1	k5y1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	וַֽ⁠יְהִי־אִ֣ישׁ מִבִּנְיָמִ֗ין	1	The author is using this phrase to introduce Saul as a new participant in the story, beginning in this verse by providing information about his father Kish and his ancestry. Your language may have its own way of introducing new participants that you can use in your translation.
9:1	w8jl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אִ֣ישׁ יְמִינִ֑י	1	This expression could mean the same thing as **a man from Benjamin** earlier in the verse. In that case, the author would be repeating this information for emphasis. However, this expression could also mean that Kish was not only a member of the tribe of Benjamin by descent but that he was also still living within the territory of that tribe. The UST models one way to express that meaning.
9:1	pryt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	גִּבּ֖וֹר חָֽיִל	1	While in many biblical contexts this expression describes a soldier who can fight powerfully and effectively, the terms can also describe a great man of wealth, and many interpreters consider that to be the implicit meaning in this context. The UST models one way to express this meaning.
9:2	a0dc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	בָּח֣וּר וָ⁠ט֔וֹב	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **good** tells what kind of **youth** Saul was. Alternate translation: [a good-looking young man]

Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: [He was a head taller than anyone else] or [He was significantly taller than other Israelite men]

In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
9:3	q0ba		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	אֲבִ֣י שָׁא֑וּל	1	It might seem that this expression contains extra information about Kish that would not be natural to express in your language, since the author reminds readers that Saul was **his son** in the next sentence. If so, you do not need to reflect this expression in your translation.
9:3	jdn2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠ק֣וּם	1	See how you translated the term “arose” in [1:9](../01/09.md). The verb has a similar meaning here. Alternate translation: [and take action]

9:4	v7gc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וָ⁠אַ֔יִן	1	The author is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: [but they found nothing there]

Presuming that the donkeys had not crossed the Jordan River or gone up into the mountains, Saul and his servant had made a circuit to look in the areas northwest, west, and southwest of their home. So the implication is that Zuph was the final place where they could have hoped to find the donkeys. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state this explicitly in your translation. Alternate translation: [into the land of Zuph, which was the final place where they could hope to find the donkeys]
9:5	p50s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	יֶחְדַּ֥ל & מִן־הָ⁠אֲתֹנ֖וֹת	1	The author is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

9:6	st19		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בָּ⁠עִ֣יר הַ⁠זֹּ֔את	1	The implication from the narrative is that **this city** means Ramah, the home of Samuel. The author says in [7:17](../07/17.md) that Samuel stayed there except when he was making his annual circuit as a judge, and the author indicates in [1:1](../01/01.md) that this Ramah was in the region of Zuph. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [lives here in the city of Ramah]

If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the intensification. Alternate translation: [Everything that he says is going to happen actually does happen]
9:6	uxqo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֶת־דַּרְכֵּ֖⁠נוּ אֲשֶׁר־הָלַ֥כְנוּ עָלֶֽי⁠הָ	1	The servant is speaking of the **way** on which he and Saul have gone to represent the purpose for which the two of them have been traveling.

9:7	qakq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	הַ⁠לֶּ֨חֶם֙	1	Saul is using one kind of food, **bread**, to represent food in general. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [all of the food]

If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [I have one fourth of a shekel of silver in my hand]
9:8	oa1i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	נִמְצָ֣א בְ⁠יָדִ֔⁠י רֶ֖בַע שֶׁ֣קֶל כָּ֑סֶף	1	The servant is speaking of his **hand** to represent his possession of the silver.

It was not simply a fee. It would not be appropriate to suggest that this was a payment in exchange for which Samuel provided a service. Alternate translation: [And I will give it to him to honor him as a man of God, which we should do if we want to consult him, and he will declare to us our way]

In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
9:9	rvj8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge		0	Since the background information that the author provides in this verse relates to what happens in [verse 11](../09/11.md), if it would be helpful to your readers, you could create a verse bridge for [verses 9–11](../09/09.md) and put the content of [verse 9](../09/09.md) at the end of it. The UST models one way to do that.

9:10	xw2c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	אֲשֶׁר־שָׁ֖ם אִ֥ישׁ הָ⁠אֱלֹהִֽים	1	It might seem that this expression contains extra information that would not be natural to express in your language. If so, you can shorten it. Alternate translation: [where the man of God was]
9:11	s0hy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠הֵ֨מָּה֙ מָצְא֣וּ	1	The author does not mean that Saul and the servant were looking for **young women** whom they could ask about Samuel and that they **found** some. He means that they met or encountered them. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [and they met]
9:12	mwsf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לְ⁠פָנֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1	The young women are speaking of Saul’s **face** to represent what is in front of him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language as in the UST.

Alternate translation: [Since the sacrifice of the day is to the people at the high place, he has come to the city today, so you should hurry now]
9:12	gas3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	זֶ֧בַח הַ⁠יּ֛וֹם לָ⁠עָ֖ם	1	The young women are using this possessive form not to describe a daily sacrifice but to describe a special sacrifice that Samuel was going to offer on that day.

There is a further step in the logic. The young women mean that the people are still preparing the feast so that Samuel can bless it and that is why he has not gone up to the festival yet. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [because he has not yet gone up to the high place to eat, since the people are still preparing the feast so that he can bless it. For the people will not eat until he comes and does that]

9:13	lbzs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	כְ⁠הַ⁠יּ֖וֹם	1	The young women are using a common expression of their culture to refer to the present moment. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [right away] or [just at this time]

Since the two phrases together give the reason for what Yahweh says in the preceding part of the verse, you could then move them to the beginning of the verse. Alternate translation: [The cry of my people has come to me, and so I have considered their situation, and as a result, about this time tomorrow]
9:16	mibt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִ⁠יַּ֣ד פְּלִשְׁתִּ֑ים	1	Yahweh is speaking of the **hand** of the Philistines to represent their power.

However, the first instance of the pronoun **you** is plural because Samuel is inviting both Saul and the servant to the feast.

9:27	qv1z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	כַּ⁠יּ֔וֹם	1	Samuel is using a common expression of his culture to refer to the present moment. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [right away] or [just at this time]

10:intro	abca				0	# 1 Samuel 10 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the section of the book about Saul. It describes how Samuel told Saul in advance several things that would happen to him. Samuel did that to show Saul that Yahweh genuinely had instructed him to appoint Saul as king. The chapter also describes how Samuel gathered all of the Israelites together at the city of Mizpah to demonstrate, through the casting of lots, that Yahweh had chosen Saul as king.
10:1	l8j6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וַ⁠יִּקַּ֨ח שְׁמוּאֵ֜ל אֶת־פַּ֥ךְ הַ⁠שֶּׁ֛מֶן וַ⁠יִּצֹ֥ק עַל־רֹאשׁ֖⁠וֹ	1	Pouring oil on Saul’s head was a symbolic action by which Samuel indicated that God was appointing Saul as king.

10:1	htrg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	עַל־רֹאשׁ֖⁠וֹ	1	The pronoun **his** refers to Saul. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: [on Saul’s head]
10:1	xhfq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וַ⁠יִּשָּׁקֵ֑⁠הוּ	1	This was a symbolic action that showed Samuel’s respect and loyalty to Saul as the new king. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. If your readers would find it embarrassing if your translation said that one man kissed another man, you could translate the expression in a more general way. Alternate translation: [and Samuel kissed Saul to show his loyalty and respect for him as king] or [and Samuel gave Saul a sign of respect that showed his loyalty to him as king]
10:1	aadr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠ל֗וֹא כִּֽי־מְשָׁחֲ⁠ךָ֧ יְהוָ֛ה עַל־נַחֲלָת֖⁠וֹ לְ⁠נָגִֽיד	1	Samuel is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [Know for certain that Yahweh has anointed you as ruler over his inheritance!]
10:1	ofuf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	נַחֲלָת֖⁠וֹ	1	Samuel is speaking as if the people of Israel were something that Yahweh had inherited as a lasting possession. He means that the Israelites belong to Yahweh perpetually. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [his chosen people]

Alternate translation: [And they will tell you that the female donkeys that you went to seek have been found, but now your father has abandoned the matters of the female donkeys and has become concerned about you and is asking what he shall do about you]
10:2	n2pe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	אֶת־דִּבְרֵ֣י הָ⁠אֲתֹנ֔וֹת	1	The people speaking to Saul are using the plural form **matters** because they are referring to several **donkeys**. Your language may use plural forms in the same way. If not, you could use a singular form here. Alternate translation: [the matter of the female donkeys]
10:2	f208		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	נִמְצְא֤וּ הָ⁠אֲתֹנוֹת֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר הָלַ֣כְתָּ לְ⁠בַקֵּ֔שׁ	1	The expression **have been found** is a passive verbal form.

Alternate translation: [someone has found the female donkeys that you went to look for]

10:3	us2c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	מִ⁠שָּׁ֜ם וָ⁠הָ֗לְאָה	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **farther** tells in what way Saul would go **from there**. Alternate translation: [farther from there]

Alternate translation: [going to Bethel to worship God]
10:3	nvsy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	נֹשֵׂ֣א ׀ שְׁלֹשָׁ֣ה גְדָיִ֗ים	1	The verb that the ULT translates as **carrying** here does not necessarily mean that this man had lifted these goats off the ground and was holding them in his arms as he walked. That is the meaning in the case of the **loaves of bread**, but in the case of these goats, the verb probably means that the man was leading them along. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [leading three young goats]
10:4	eivt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וְ⁠שָׁאֲל֥וּ לְ⁠ךָ֖ לְ⁠שָׁל֑וֹם	1	Here the abstract noun **peace** indicates the idea of “welfare.” If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **peace**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [And they will ask you if you are doing well and inquire whether there is anything they can do to help you]
10:4	b2a2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	מִ⁠יָּדָֽ⁠ם	1	Samuel is using one part of these men, their **hand**, to mean all of them in the act of giving. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [from them]
10:4	xzsq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	מִ⁠יָּדָֽ⁠ם	1	In this verse, the word **hand** is singular in form, but since Samuel is referring to a group of people, if you retain this expression in your translation, it may be more natural in your language to use the plural form. Alternate translation: [from their hands]
10:5	hd63		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	גִּבְעַ֣ת הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֔ים	1	The context suggests that **Gibeah of God** is the name of the same city that the author calls “Gibeah of Saul” in [11:4](../11/04.md) and [15:34](../15/34.md). This was Saul’s home city, and people gave it that name later when he became famous as king. But at this point people distinguished this city from others by the same name by referring to the high place near it. That is why Samuel calls it **Gibeah of God** in this context. We recommend that you use that name here in your translation.
10:5	drc3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	אֲשֶׁר־שָׁ֖ם נְצִבֵ֣י פְלִשְׁתִּ֑ים	1	It might seem that this expression contains extra information that would not be natural to express in your language.

10:6	z9sm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠נֶהְפַּכְתָּ֖ לְ⁠אִ֥ישׁ אַחֵֽר	1	Samuel is speaking as if the Spirit of Yahweh would actually turn Saul **into another man**. He means that the Spirit will transform Saul’s character. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [And you will become a different kind of person]
10:7	gb3o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	כִּ֥י תבאינה הָ⁠אֹת֥וֹת הָ⁠אֵ֖לֶּה לָ֑⁠ךְ	1	Samuel is speaking of these **signs** as if they were living things that could **come** to a person on their own.

Alternate translation: [because God is with you, do for yourself what your hand finds]
10:7	r9jy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	עֲשֵׂ֤ה לְ⁠ךָ֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר תִּמְצָ֣א יָדֶ֔⁠ךָ	1	Samuel is using a common expression of his culture that means to do whatever seems best in a situation.

10:8	cnux		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לְ⁠פָנַ⁠י֮	1	Samuel is using the expression **to my face** to mean “before” or “previous to.” He is telling Saul to go to Gilgal before he arrives there. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [ahead of me]
10:8	kwe5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	לִ⁠זְבֹּ֖חַ זִבְחֵ֣י שְׁלָמִ֑ים	1	Samuel is using a construction in which a verb and its object come from the same root.

You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: [that God changed him and gave him another heart]
10:9	aqzt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יַּהֲפָךְ־ל֥⁠וֹ אֱלֹהִ֖ים לֵ֣ב אַחֵ֑ר	1	The author is speaking as if God had actually replaced Saul’s physical **heart**. He means that God transformed Saul’s attitudes, desires, and character. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [that God profoundly changed the way Saul thought and felt]
10:9	mt04		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וַ⁠יָּבֹ֛אוּ כָּל־הָ⁠אֹת֥וֹת הָ⁠אֵ֖לֶּה	1	The author is speaking of these **signs** as if they were living things that **came** on their own.

10:11	amt8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠הִנֵּ֥ה	1	In this context, the word **behold** both calls attention to what the author is about to describe and indicates that what the people **saw** was surprising to them. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: [much to their surprise]
10:11	efy7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אִ֣ישׁ אֶל־רֵעֵ֗⁠הוּ	1	The author is using a common expression of his culture that describes individuals speaking to one another.

He is indicating that people applied this saying to comparable situations in which a person did something that was surprising in light of his upbringing or family of origin.

This was to indicate, “If I break this covenant, may I be destroyed in this same way.” It is not necessary to understand this background to covenant ceremonies in order to understand the action in this chapter, so you do not have to use the term “cut” in your translation.

However, as Nahash himself explains, it would also be a symbolic action that would show other nations that the Israelites had not been able to defend their own people. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: [in the disgraceful and disabling gouging of every right eye of you]

11:15	y8bp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	שְׁלָמִ֖ים	1	In this context, the term **peace offerings** describes sacrifices that the Israelites offered to Yahweh to acknowledge that he was the one who had enabled them to defeat the Ammonites. Sacrificing animals that provided the meat for a feast, and burning up some of the animals as Yahweh’s share, was therefore a symbolic action. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: [peace offerings to express their gratitude to Yahweh]
12:intro	abcc				0	# 1 Samuel 12 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the story of King Saul by telling how Samuel addressed the assembled Israelites at Gilgal to talk about the kingship with them. Samuel told them that even though they should not have asked for a king for the reasons they did, Yahweh had nevertheless given them a king, and Yahweh would bless them and their king if they were devoted and obedient to him.\n\nThis chapter serves as a type of farewell address. In this culture, leaders gave instructions to their followers before they left or died. Joshua does something similar in [Joshua 23](../../jos/23/01.md) and 24, using similar language. If you have already translated the book of Joshua, see how you translated his farewell address, and translate Samuel’s address here similarly.

12:20	mvni		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אַתֶּ֣ם עֲשִׂיתֶ֔ם	1	Samuel is stating the pronoun **You** separately, even though the verb translated as **you have done** already includes this meaning.

(However, be sure it is clear in your translation that Samuel is not saying that Yahweh is motivated by what people think of him and that he tries to do what makes a good impression on people.

13:intro	abcd				0	# 1 Samuel 13 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the story of King Saul by telling how, when he felt threatened by an invading Philistine army, he disobeyed a direct command from Yahweh. Samuel told him that as a consequence, Yahweh would not allow him to have a dynasty. That is, none of his descendants would succeed him as king. Instead, Yahweh would choose “a man according to his heart” to become the next king. So this chapter looks forward to the transition that the book later makes from King Saul to King David. But more immediately, it also begins an account that continues through the next chapter of a war between the Israelites and Philistines.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### How many chariots did the Philistines have?\n\nThe traditional Hebrew text says in [13:5](../13/05.md) that the Philistines invaded Israel with 30,000 chariots and 6,000 horsemen. This statement is problematic because ancient armies always had more horsemen than chariots and because no armies in the ancient world, even those of great empires, are attested to have had nearly that many chariots. One plausible explanation for the reading is that during the process of transmission, the singular word “three” was copied in the plural, which meant “thirty” in Hebrew. Some ancient versions do read “3,000” here, suggesting that this was the original reading. An army of 3,000 chariots and 6,000 horsemen would suit the cultural context. Many modern versions adopt that reading, and you may wish to do so in your own translation.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### A standard way of describing a king’s reign\n\nThe statement in [13:1](../13/01.md), “Saul {was} a son of a year in his becoming king, and he reigned over Israel two years,” is the first instance of a standard description that occurs repeatedly in this history of Israel that extends through 1–2 Samuel and 1–2 Kings. At the start of the account of each king’s reign, the history tells how old that man was when he became king and for how long he reigned. (There are problems with the numbers in [13:1](../13/01.md); see the two discussions just below.) In your translation, be sure to translate this description consistently in each of its occurrences (here and in [2 Samuel 2:10](../../2sa/02/10.md) and [2 Samuel 5:4](../../2sa/05/04.md), etc.) so that your readers will recognize how the history is using it.\n\n### How old was Saul when he became king?\n\nA number appears to have dropped out of [13:1](../13/01.md) during the process of the transmission of the traditional Hebrew text, since that verse says that Saul was one year old when he became king. In ancient manuscripts, scribes did not write out numbers. They used letters to represent them. There are other examples where it seems evident that a letter has dropped out of the traditional text, and since [13:1](../13/01.md) does not make sense in its present form, that seems to be what has happened. While, as a result, we probably cannot be certain how old Saul was when he became king, some ancient versions say that he was 30 years old, and you may find that to be a reasonable number to use in your translation.\n\n### How long did Saul reign?\n\nThe traditional Hebrew text says in [13:1](../13/01.md) that Saul “reigned over Israel two years.” However, the narrative in 1 Samuel describes extensive events of his reign, suggesting that it lasted much longer than that. There are further indications of this in Scripture. Paul says in [Acts 13:21](../../act/13/21.md) that Saul reigned for 40 years. (This could be a round number, meaning about 40 years.) [2 Samuel 2:10](../../2sa/02/10.md) records that Saul’s son Ishbosheth was 40 years old when he began to reign. Since he is not listed in [1 Samuel 14:49](../14/49.md) as one of the sons whom Saul had when he became king, many interpreters believe that he was born after the beginning of Saul’s reign, suggesting that his reign was at least 40 years long. All things considered, it seems probable that a number written as a single letter has dropped out from this verse and that it originally said that Saul reigned over Israel for 42 years. You may wish to use that number in your translation.

Your language may have its own way of reintroducing participants that you can use in your translation. See the discussion in the Introduction to this chapter of the form of this statement, which marks the reigns of kings throughout the books of 1 and 2 Samuel and 1 and 2 Kings.
13:1	ppj9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בֶּן־שָׁנָ֖ה שָׁא֣וּל בְּ⁠מָלְכ֑⁠וֹ	1	The phrase **a son of** was a common expression in this culture that described a person’s age.

13:2	pz2b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	י֣וֹנָתָ֔ן	1	Here the author is introducing Jonathan as a new participant in the story. He introduces him more fully as “Saul’s son” in [13:16](../13/16.md). Your language may have its own way of introducing new participants that you can use here in your translation.
13:2	lbo6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הָ⁠עָ֔ם	1	The author assumes that readers will recognize that in this context, the term **people** refers to the men of Israel who were able to fight as soldiers. That is also the meaning in the frequent occurrences of this term in the rest of the chapter (except for in [13:4](../13/04.md)). Alternate translation: [the soldiers]
13:2	bqva		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	שִׁלַּ֖ח אִ֥ישׁ לְ⁠אֹהָלָֽי⁠ו	1	The author is using **a man to his tent** as a common expression of his culture to mean that the soldiers stopped their military campaign altogether and each of them went back to his home and family. If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [he released from military service and sent away]

Since the author describes in [13:16](../13/16.md) how Saul and Jonathan soon occupied this strategic position in **Geba** themselves, it should be understood that Jonathan destroyed the Philistine garrison there. Alternate translation: [And Jonathan destroyed]
13:3	stgr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וַ⁠יַּ֣ךְ יוֹנָתָ֗ן	1	The author is using Jonathan to represent him and the soldiers under his command. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [And Jonathan and his soldiers destroyed]

13:4	foev		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וְ⁠כָל־יִשְׂרָאֵ֞ל שָׁמְע֣וּ לֵ⁠אמֹ֗ר	1	The term **saying** introduces a direct quotation, but it is a quotation of what Saul’s messengers were saying, not what the Israelites were saying in response. You may wish to indicate this in your translation, using a natural way of introducing direct quotations in your language. Alternate translation: [And all of Israel heard the messengers saying]
13:4	sc09		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	הִכָּ֤ה שָׁאוּל֙	1	The author is using Saul’s name to represent his army. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [Saul’s army has struck]

Alternate translation: [And the men of Israel saw that it was narrow to them]
13:6	epzl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	צַר־ל֔⁠וֹ	1	The author is using **it was narrow to him** as a common expression of his culture to mean “he was in a dangerous situation.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [he was in a tight spot] or [he was in very dangerous circumstances]

While this may have involved Saul wishing publicly that Yahweh would bless Samuel (that is, do good things for him), as in [15:13](../15/13.md), the focus is on Saul greeting or welcoming Samuel. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [so that he could welcome him] or [so that he could welcome him]

13:11	qdzz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠אַתָּה֙ לֹא־בָ֨אתָ֙	1	Saul is stating the pronoun **you** separately, even though the verb translated as **you had not come** already includes this meaning. He is doing that to emphasize that, in his view, Samuel has not done what he said he would do. If a speaker of your language would use an explicit pronoun for the same purpose, you may want to use that construction in your translation. If not, your language may have other ways of showing what Saul means here. Alternate translation: [You actually had not come]

14:intro	abce				0	# 1 Samuel 14 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the story of Saul by describing how the Israelites under his command, particularly through the exploits of his son Jonathan, won a great victory over the Philistines.\n\n1. Jonathan and his armor bearer defeat a Philistine garrison, causing panic among the entire Philistine army. (1–15)\n2. All of the Israelites mobilize and defeat the Philistines. (16–23)\n3. Saul causes trouble for the Israelites by cursing any one of them who eats on the day of the battle. (24–46)\n4. A summary of Saul’s lineage, family, and activities as king. (47–52)\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### The name “Hebrews”\n\nAs the Introduction to [chapter 13](../13/01.md) discusses, the name “Hebrews” was a term of contempt that the Philistines used for the Israelites. That is why the Philistines use it in [14:11](../14/11.md) as they speak disparagingly of the Israelites “coming out from the holes where they hid themselves.” In [14:21](../14/21.md), the author uses the term “Hebrews” for Israelite solders who had defected to the Philistines. As in [13:7](../13/07.md), where the author refers to Israelite soldiers who fled across the Jordan from the Philistine army, he may be using the term in [14:21](../14/21.md) to suggest that these deserters also deserved to be called by a contemptuous name. Whatever the explanation, since “Hebrews” is the actual term that these characters and the author use in the biblical text, you should use that same term in your translation.\n\n### Did Jonathan pass between the cliffs of Bozez and Seneh, or did he climb up and over them?\n\nIn [14:4–5](../14/04.md), the author describes and names two cliffs or rock faces that were either in or beside the route that Jonathan envisioned taking from Geba over to the Philistine garrison near Michmash. Many versions of the Bible suggest or state in [verse 4](../14/04.md) that these cliffs were on either side of Jonathan’s route, so that he passed between them. However, since the author explains in [verse 5](../14/05.md) that one cliff was on the north side of the valley that Jonathan was crossing and the other cliff was on the south side, and since Michmash was on the north side of the valley and Geba was on the south side, it does not appear that Jonathan passed between these cliffs. Rather, he had to climb over them in order to reach the Philistines. They had apparently blocked all of the other, more accessible routes through the valley. So the author is relating a feat of strength that Jonathan and his armor bearer performed, in addition to their feat of daring in attacking the Philistine garrison. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region that says that Jonathan passed between these cliffs, you will have to consider whether to follow its reading, but we recommend that you indicate in your translation that he climbed up and over them.\n\n### Why did Saul make the soldiers not eat anything on the day of the battle?\n\nThe author describes in [14:24](../14/24.md) how Saul put a curse on any soldier who ate anything during the day when the Israelite army was fighting the Philistines. As the rest of the story shows, that led to the soldiers becoming weak from hunger and thus less effective fighters. It ultimately led to them desperately slaughtering and eating meat from animals they had plundered from the Philistines without draining the blood first, which was a violation of the law of Moses. So forbidding eating was not a good thing for Saul to do. Why, then, did he do it? It may be that, in practical terms, he did not want the soldiers to spend time away from fighting in order to prepare and eat meals. Since going without food was also a sign of devotion to God, Saul may also have had religious reasons for giving this command. He may have wanted the soldiers to demonstrate their devotion to Yahweh in this way, perhaps to seek Yahweh’s favor and help in the battle. Whatever the reasons, as Jonathan said when he heard about this, Saul’s curse caused trouble for the Israelites.
14:1	r269		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֣י	1	The author is using this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. See how you translated it in [1:12](../01/12.md).
14:1	t7cb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	הַ⁠נַּ֨עַר֙ נֹשֵׂ֣א כֵלָ֔י⁠ו	1	The expression **the carrier of his equipment** refers to a soldier who, in ancient warfare, carried the weapons and armor of a superior soldier and who fought alongside that soldier. Your language may have a term that your readers would recognize for a person in a similar role. Alternate translation: [the young man who was Jonathan’s armor-bearer]
14:1	lyl9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠נַעְבְּרָה֙ אֶל־מַצַּ֣ב פְּלִשְׁתִּ֔ים אֲשֶׁ֖ר מֵ⁠עֵ֣בֶר הַלָּ֑ז	1	The author expects readers to understand that Jonathan is suggesting that he and his armor-bearer cross the valley from Geba to the top of the cliff where the Philistine garrison was, based on the author’s statements in [13:16](../13/16.md) that the Israelites were occupying a position in Geba and in [13:23](../13/23.md) that the Philistines had sent a detachment of soldiers to guard the pass of Michmash. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [and let us cross over from here in Geba to attack the Philistine garrison that is on top of the cliff opposite us]
14:2	bt4d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וְ⁠שָׁא֗וּל יוֹשֵׁב֙ בִּ⁠קְצֵ֣ה הַ⁠גִּבְעָ֔ה	1	The author is providing background information to help readers understand what happens in the story.

14:2	cxbq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	תַּ֥חַת הָ⁠רִמּ֖וֹן	1	Sitting under this **tree** was a symbolic action that showed Saul was acting as judge and military leader. There is a similar example in [22:6](../22/06.md) of Saul sitting under a different kind of tree for this same purpose. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: [sitting regally under the pomegranate tree]
14:2	cz1r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠הָ⁠עָם֙	1	The author assumes that readers will understand that by **people** here and throughout this chapter, he means men of Israel who were able to fight as soldiers, as in the previous chapter. See how you translated the term there. Alternate translation: [And the soldiers]

It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers, using the kinship terms of your language and culture. The UST models one way to do that. (Since the author indicates in [4:19–22](../04/19.md) that Phinehas and his wife died on the same day, the day she gave birth to Ichabod, it is clear that Ahitub was the older brother of Ichabod. Your language may mark that distinction.)
14:4	my7b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	הַֽ⁠מַּעְבְּר֗וֹת	1	The context suggests that Jonathan was planning to cross the valley by a single route that went down into the valley and back up the other side. The author seems to be using the plural form, in keeping with the conventions of his language and culture, because this was the way both from Geba to Michmash and from Michmash to Geba. It may be more natural in your language to use a singular form. Alternate translation: [the passageway]
14:4	ninu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	שֵׁן־הַ⁠סֶּ֤לַע & וְ⁠שֵׁן־הַ⁠סֶּ֥לַע	1	The author is using this possessive form to mean a **rock** that had the appearance of a **tooth**, similar to how some languages might say “a giant of a man” to mean “a giant man.” If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the meaning using a different form. Alternate translation: [were a rock that looked like a large tooth … and another rock that looked like a large tooth] or [were a tall rock … and a tall rock]

You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: [The tooth of the one was a pillar from the north before Michmash, and the tooth of the other one was a pillar from the south before Geba]
14:5	r759		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מָצ֥וּק	1	The author is speaking of each of the rocks as if they were a **pillar**, that is, a tall supporting column in a buildings. He is using this image to mean that they were tall and straight. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. You could also use plain language.

He is using this as a term of derision, suggesting that since the Philistines do not worship Yahweh and obey his laws, they will not be formidable opponents.

14:6	dlg8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	כִּ֣י	1	Here the word **for** introduces not a reason but an explanation. Alternate translation: [After all,]

14:7	apxf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	נְטֵ֣ה לָ֔⁠ךְ & עִמְּ⁠ךָ֖	1	The author is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: [Turn yourself in whatever direction you wish … I am with you]
14:7	x9be		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	נְטֵ֣ה לָ֔⁠ךְ	1	The armor-bearer is using **turn yourself** as a common expression of his culture to mean “take whatever course of action you consider best.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [Go ahead] or [Take whatever course of action you consider best]
14:7	hgbp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	עִמְּ⁠ךָ֖	1	The armor-bearer is using **with you** as a common expression of his culture.

14:8	blnm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הִנֵּ֛ה	1	See how you translated the term **Behold** in [2:31](../02/31.md), and consider how you would translate it in this context. Alternate translation: [All right]
14:8	wlz6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הָ⁠אֲנָשִׁ֑ים	1	The author assumes that readers will understand that by **the men** Jonathan means the Philistine soldiers in the detachment opposite them. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [those Philistine soldiers]
14:9	u6oc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	אִם־כֹּ֤ה יֹֽאמְרוּ֙ אֵלֵ֔י⁠נוּ דֹּ֕מּוּ עַד־הַגִּיעֵ֖⁠נוּ אֲלֵי⁠כֶ֑ם	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation.

Alternate translation: [then this will be a sign for us that Yahweh has given them into our hand, so we will go up]
14:10	mncn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	נְתָנָ֥⁠ם יְהוָ֖ה בְּ⁠יָדֵ֑⁠נוּ	1	Jonathan is using the past tense to describe something that he believes would certainly happen in the future.

14:12	mxeo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּֽאמְרוּ֙	1	The term **and said** introduces a direct quotation. In your translation, use a natural way of introducing direct quotations in your language. It may not be necessary to represent this term explicitly.

14:12	w6cd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	Jonathan is using the name **Israel** to represent Israelite soldiers, and specifically himself and his armor-bearer.

14:13	jebp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יַּ֣עַל יוֹנָתָ֗ן עַל־יָדָי⁠ו֙ וְ⁠עַל־רַגְלָ֔י⁠ו	1	The author is using a common expression of his culture to describe a way of climbing. Your language may have a comparable expression that you could use in your translation. You could also use plain language.

14:13	tna2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַֽ⁠יִּפְּלוּ֙	1	The pronoun **they** refers to the Philistine soldiers who were defending this position. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: [And the Philistine soldiers fell]
14:13	nwoq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַֽ⁠יִּפְּלוּ֙ לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י יוֹנָתָ֔ן	1	The author is using the term **fell** to represent that these soldiers died in battle, as in [4:10](../04/10.md). He is using the term **face** to represent that these soldiers were in front of Jonathan, as is discussed in the Introduction to 1 Samuel. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use equivalent expressions or plain language. Alternate translation: [And they died as Jonathan attacked the soldiers who were in front of him]
14:14	ef35		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	וַ⁠תְּהִ֞י הַ⁠מַּכָּ֣ה הָ⁠רִאשֹׁנָ֗ה אֲשֶׁ֨ר הִכָּ֧ה יוֹנָתָ֛ן וְ⁠נֹשֵׂ֥א כֵלָ֖י⁠ו	1	The author is using a construction in which a verb and its object come from the same root. You may be able to use the same construction in your language. Alternatively, your language may have another way of saying this. See how you translated the term **striking** in [4:10](../04/10.md). Alternate translation: [And the first slaughter that Jonathan and his armor-bearer made was]
14:14	pnpy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הִכָּ֧ה	1	See the discussion of the term struck in the Introduction to 1 Samuel. Alternate translation: [slaughtered]
14:14	k48n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	כְּ⁠בַ⁠חֲצִ֥י מַעֲנָ֖ה צֶ֥מֶד שָׂדֶֽה	1	The author is expressing a distance in terms of his culture. A **yoke of a field** means a field that a pair of oxen could plow in a day (about an acre or 0.4 hectares). This **furrow** would be one side of that (about 210 feet or 65 meters), so **half a furrow** would mean about 100 feet or 30 meters. Jonathan and his armor-bearer penetrated this far into the Philistine camp, killing any soldiers who tried to stop them. Alternate translation: [over a distance of about 30 meters] or [over a distance of about 100 feet]
14:15	jsho		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בַ⁠מַּחֲנֶ֤ה בַ⁠שָּׂדֶה֙ וּ⁠בְ⁠כָל־הָ⁠עָ֔ם	1	The author assumes that readers will understand that **the camp in the field** means the Philistine outpost that Jonathan attacked, while **all of the people** means the soldiers of the main Philistine army at Michmash. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [not only in the detachment that was guarding the pass but also among all of the soldiers in the main Philistine army at Michmash]
14:15	jfpc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	הַ⁠מַּצָּב֙ וְ⁠הַ⁠מַּשְׁחִ֔ית	1	Since the author says that **even** these groups **trembled** in addition to the detachment and the main army, he is likely referring to other garrisons the Philistines had set up and to the raiding bands he described in [13:17](../13/17.md). Since he is referring to multiple groups in each case, it may be more natural in your language to use plural forms. Alternate translation: [The garrisons and the destroyers] or [The soldiers in the other outposts that the Philistines had set up and in the raiding bands that they were sending out]
14:15	nvp8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לְ⁠חֶרְדַּ֥ת אֱלֹהִֽים	1	The expression **a trembling of God** could be: (1) a common expression of his culture that the author is using that described something as very great by saying it belongs to God. Alternate translation: [a very great trembling]; (2) an indication that God caused this trembling. Alternate translation: [a trembling caused by God]
14:16	aiiz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הֶ⁠הָמ֛וֹן נָמ֖וֹג	1	The author is speaking of this **multitude**, meaning the Philistine army, as if it were a solid substance that was becoming liquid and flowing away. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [the Philistine army was breaking up in confusion]
14:16	xyo9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יֵּ֥לֶךְ וַ⁠הֲלֹֽם	1	The author is using **and went, even here** as a common expression of his culture to mean that the Philistine soldiers were going in many different directions. Your language may have a comparable expression that you could use in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: [and was going here and there] or [and was scattering in many directions]

One ancient version reads instead “the ephod” and “For he wore the ephod in those days before the sons of Israel.” This suits the context, since the author mentions in [14:3](../14/03.md) that Ahijah was present and wearing an ephod, while the narrative indicates in [7:2](../07/02.md) that the Box stayed in Kiriath Jearim for many years. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
14:18	o22r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הַגִּ֖ישָׁ⁠ה אֲר֣וֹן הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֑ים	1	The author assumes that readers will understand that Saul wanted Ahijah to bring the Box so that he could use it to consult Yahweh about what to do in this situation.

Alternate translation: [Bring near the Box of God so that I can use it to consult Yahweh about what to do about this situation]
14:18	oo6y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בַּ⁠יּ֥וֹם הַ⁠ה֖וּא	1	The author is using the term **day** to represent a specific time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [during that time]
14:19	cgbi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	וַ⁠יֵּ֥לֶךְ הָל֖וֹךְ וָ⁠רָ֑ב	1	The author is repeating forms of the verb “go” to intensify his expression of the idea it expresses. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the intensification. Alternate translation: [that it went continually and became great]
14:19	mqcm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	וַ⁠יֵּ֥לֶךְ הָל֖וֹךְ וָ⁠רָ֑ב	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two verbal phrases connected with “and.” The phrase **going, it went** tells in what way the tumult **became great**. Alternate translation: [that it became great continually] or [that it kept increasing]
14:19	j610		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֱסֹ֥ף יָדֶֽ⁠ךָ	1	Saul is using the term **hand** to represent the activity that Ahijah was performing with his hands. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [Cease your activity]

If your language would not use that form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [And Saul called together all of the soldiers who were with him]
14:20	wsz5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	הָיְתָ֜ה חֶ֤רֶב אִישׁ֙ בְּ⁠רֵעֵ֔⁠הוּ	1	The author is speaking of a **sword** as if it were a living thing that could act on its own. He means that the Philistine soldiers were using their swords to attack one another. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [the Philistine soldiers were attacking one another with their swords]
14:20	wl57		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	מְהוּמָ֖ה גְּדוֹלָ֥ה מְאֹֽד	1	The author is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: [so that there was a very great tumult]

14:22	kwh3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	וַֽ⁠יַּדְבְּק֥וּ גַם־הֵ֛מָּה אַחֲרֵי⁠הֶ֖ם	1	The author is repeating the pronoun **they** for emphasis. Your language might more naturally express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: [and even they pursued after them]
14:22	lsb7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַֽ⁠יַּדְבְּק֥וּ גַם־הֵ֛מָּה אַחֲרֵי⁠הֶ֖ם	1	The pronoun **they** refers to the Israelites who had been hiding, and the pronoun **them** refers to the fleeing Philistine soldiers. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: [and even these Israelites who had been hiding joined in pursuing the Philistines]
14:23	yhil		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ⁠הַ֨⁠מִּלְחָמָ֔ה עָבְרָ֖ה אֶת־בֵּ֥ית אָֽוֶן	1	The author is speaking of **the battle** as if it were a living thing that could pass over a city on its own. He means that the Israelites pursued and fought the Philistines all the way to the city of Beth Aven and beyond it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [And the Israelites continued pursuing and fighting the Philistines as far as Beth Aven and beyond]

Alternate translation: [But Saul had distressed the men of Israel … May Yahweh curse the man]
14:24	fyvs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	לֵ⁠אמֹ֗ר	1	See whether you chose to represent the term **saying** in [4:21](../04/21.md), and if so, how you translated it.
14:24	uirj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	אָר֣וּר הָ֠⁠אִישׁ	1	Saul is speaking about the people he is addressing in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the second person. Alternate translation: [Cursed is any one of you]

He means specifically the Israelite men who were serving as soldiers. Many of them were coming from other parts of the land, as [14:22](../14/22.md) describes. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [And all the Israelite soldiers]

The term he uses can have that meaning, and the focus here may be on the wooden shaft of the spear, which Jonathan would have used to reach for this honey, rather than on the metal point. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers as modeled in the UST.
14:27	b2f9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יִּטְבֹּ֥ל אוֹתָ֖⁠הּ בְּ⁠יַעְרַ֣ת הַ⁠דְּבָ֑שׁ	1	The author seems to mean that Jonathan reached up into a tree to get honey from a honeycomb, since Jonathan could simply have picked up honey off the ground with his hands. Alternate translation: [and he reached up into a tree and used it to scoop some honey out of one of the honeycombs]
14:27	llnk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יָּ֤שֶׁב יָד⁠וֹ֙ אֶל־פִּ֔י⁠ו	1	The author seems to mean that Jonathan used his **hand** to bring the end of his staff back to his mouth so that he could eat the honey it had collected, as Jonathan himself says in [14:43](../14/43.md). To eat the honey, Jonathan would have held the staff with his hand near the honey-covered end of it, so in that sense he was returning his hand to his mouth. Alternate translation: [And he pulled the staff back and ate some honey off the end of it]
14:27	tm3q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַתָּאֹ֖רְנָה עֵינָֽי⁠ו	1	The author is using the brightening of Jonathan’s eyes to represent that eating the honey restored his strength.

15:intro	abcf				0	# 1 Samuel 15 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter concludes the section of the book that describes how Saul became king (8–15). It relates how Saul disobeyed a direct command from Yahweh for a second time and so forfeited the kingship itself.\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [15:22–23](../15/22.md) and [15:33](../15/33.md).\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Why did Samuel become angry when Yahweh said he was sorry he had made Saul king?\n\nWhile the author does not say specifically why Samuel became angry when Yahweh said he was sorry he had made Saul king ([15:11](../15/11.md)), this seems to have been because Samuel had anointed Saul and still believed that he could be a good king. However, this was before Samuel went to Gilgal and discovered how badly Saul had disobeyed Yahweh. The author is not suggesting that there was anything sinful about Samuel feeling this emotion. It reflected Samuel’s accurate understanding of what a good king Saul could have been if he had obeyed Yahweh (as he suggested in [12:20–25](../12/20.md)).\n\n### When Saul repented of his sin, why did Samuel at first refuse to go with him to worship?\n\nIn [15:14–23](../15/14.md), Samuel chastises Saul for disobeying Yahweh and plundering the best of the Amalekites’ animals rather than destroying all of them. At first Saul makes excuses, but in [15:24–25](../15/24.md) he finally admits that he has sinned and asks for forgiveness. Even so, Samuel at first refuses to go back with him to where the other Israelite soldiers are and worship Yahweh. In general, the Bible promises that if people admit that they have sinned and ask forgiveness, God will forgive their sin and restore them to a condition in which they can freely worship him again. However, in this context, it appears that Saul wanted Samuel to preside at the sacrifice of the animals the soldiers had kept from the Amalekite plunder. If Samuel had done that, for one thing, he would have been implicitly approving the act of keeping those animals. Beyond that, since Yahweh had rejected Saul as king, Samuel apparently did not want to endorse his kingship any longer. So he refused to return with Saul. However, after Saul pleaded with him, “please honor me before the elders of my people and before Israel,” Samuel agreed. It appears that Samuel recognized that the Israelite people still needed to honor and respect the king they had until Yahweh appointed another one. So he did return with Saul. However, while [15:31](../15/31.md) says that then “Saul worshiped Yahweh,” it does not say that Samuel offered any sacrifices using the animals that the Israelite soldiers had disobediently plundered.\n\n### “devote”\n\nIn this chapter, Yahweh (in [15:3](../15/03.md)) and the author (in [15:8](../15/08.md)) use a term that the ULT translates as “devote” and “devoted.” This was a specialized term that described the cultural practice of giving something over to Yahweh so that humans would no longer be able to use it. Depending on the context, this term could indicate either “destroy” or “preserve but set apart.” The context must determine the meaning, and in the context of this chapter, the term describes total destruction.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### “to the mouth of the sword”\n\nBiblical authors often use the expression “to the mouth of the sword” in connection with the term “devoted.” That was a common expression of this culture that referred to destroying something completely. When it appears, it helps clarify what the term “devoted” means in a specific context.\n\n### “the Glory of Israel”\n\nIn [15:29](../15/29.md), Samuel refers to Yahweh as the “Glory of Israel.” Interpreters are not entirely sure what this phrase means. The term that the ULT translates as “Glory” refers to a bright object in the distance that provides an orientation point towards which someone travels constantly. The focus could therefore be either on the brightness or on the constancy. Some versions translate this as the “Glory of Israel” or the “Splendor of Israel,” while other versions translate it with phrases such as “the Enduring One of Israel.” In context, this could be a reference either to Yahweh as glorious and divine, and therefore someone whom Saul should not have disobeyed, or to Yahweh as constant and unchanging, which is a theme in the rest of the verse. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to follow the interpretation that it does. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to follow the interpretation of the ULT.

The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Samuel is speaking poetically here, and Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition. It would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them.

16:intro	abcg				0	# 1 Samuel 16 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter begins the part of the book that describes how David became king ([chapters 16–31](../16/01.md)). Several years passed between the time when Samuel anointed David, as this chapter describes, and the time when David finally became king. In the meantime, Saul continued to reign. So this part of the book also continues to describe what Saul did as king.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Did Yahweh tell Samuel to lie?\n\nIn [16:1](../16/01.md), Yahweh tells Samuel to go to Bethlehem and anoint one of Jesse’s sons to be the next king. Samuel replies in [16:2](../16/02.md) that if Saul hears about this, he will kill him. Yahweh tells Samuel in [16:3](../16/03.md) that he should tell the people of Bethlehem, “I have come to sacrifice to Yahweh.” Was Yahweh telling Samuel to lie by saying that he had come for one reason when he had really come for a different reason?\n\nYahweh is actually telling Samuel not to say anything more than he needs to. As the author explains in [7:16](../07/16.md), Samuel would regularly go about the Israelite cities and towns in his role as a judge. As [9:13](../09/13.md) shows, Samuel would also offer sacrifices and invite people to join him in eating the meat of those animals as a feast in order to thank and honor Yahweh and to enjoy fellowship together. So Samuel could have gone to Bethlehem anyway as part of his regular duties, and his trip there actually did involve holding a feast for the elders of the town. But it also included a private visit with Jesse’s family, during which he anointed David. So Yahweh was not telling him to lie, he was advising him, for his own safety, to keep the private part of his visit private.\n\n### Why did the elders of Bethlehem tremble with fear when Samuel arrived?\n\nThe author says in [16:4](../16/04.md) that when Samuel arrived in Bethlehem, “the elders of the city trembled to meet him.” The author does not state specifically why the elders were afraid. One possibility is that they thought that someone in their town, or the whole town collectively, had done something wrong and that Samuel had come to denounce them and declare that Yahweh was going to punish them. Another possibility is that the elders of Bethlehem knew that Samuel had had a bitter dispute with Saul and was no longer seeing him in person, as [15:35](../15/35.md) states. They may have been very leery about potentially being drawn into this dispute between their longtime judge and the man who was now their king. However, since the author does not say specifically why the elders were afraid, we recommend that you do not suggest a reason in the text of your translation. In this case, say no more than the biblical text does.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Did Yahweh send a “bad” spirit or an “evil” spirit to Saul?\n\nThe author relates in [16:13–14](../16/13.md) that when Samuel anointed David, the Spirit of Yahweh rushed upon David, but the Spirit of Yahweh turned away from Saul and instead a “bad” spirit from Yahweh terrified him. Some versions of the Bible translate this as an “evil” spirit. The Hebrew term can have either meaning, depending on the context. The term should be understood to mean “bad” in this context. The Bible as a whole makes clear that God does not use evil means to accomplish his purposes. Moreover, the term “bad” may describe the effects of this spirit rather than its character. The spirit made Saul feel bad, and this may be because it made him mindful of how he had willfully disobeyed Yahweh and forfeited the kingship. Saul may have been terrified of how Yahweh would fulfill the judgment that Samuel had pronounced against him: “Yahweh has torn the kingdom of Israel from upon you today, and he has given it to your fellow, one better than you.”

17:intro	abch				0	# 1 Samuel 17 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the part of the book that describes how David became king ([chapters 16–31](../16/01.md)). It describes how he fought and killed a Philistine giant named Goliath. This shows that even as a young man, David had strong faith in God and great courage. David was motivated by a desire for the glory of God. He said that when he killed Goliath, “all of the earth will know that there is a God to Israel,” in other words, that the God of Israel is the only true God.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Single combat\n\nIn this chapter, Goliath, a great Philistine warrior, challenges any Israelite to fight him in single combat in order to determine the outcome of the war between the two peoples. Single combat between warrior champions like this was a significant practice in ancient warfare. It served both practical and symbolic purposes. Rather than risk heavy casualties in a full battle, armies would sometimes agree to let individual warriors fight as representatives of their armies. The outcome of this combat would often determine the larger conflict, with the losing side agreeing to surrender or accept terms. This practice helped reduce overall casualties while still establishing military dominance. Champions who participated in single combat were typically the most skilled and physically imposing warriors, chosen to represent their army’s strength. The practice also had important cultural and religious significance, as the outcome was often seen as indicating which army’s god was greater and stronger. So David’s confrontation with Goliath was not just military combat, it was also a spiritual contest between the God of Israel and the gods of the Philistines, which Yahweh, the God of Israel, won decisively.\n\n### Why does Goliath refer to the Israelites as “servants of Saul”?\n\nIn [17:8](../17/08.md), Goliath challenges the army of Israel to send a champion down into the Valley of Elah to fight with him in single combat. He says, “Am I not the Philistine, and you, servants of Saul? Choose for yourselves a man, and let him come down to me.” It is likely that by calling himself “the Philistine,” he is identifying himself as the designated warrior champion of the Philistines. The implications of what he is saying is that Saul ought to come and fight with him as the Israelite champion. Saul was much taller than other Israelites (although not nearly as tall as Goliath), and the Israelites had wanted someone like him as their king specifically so that he would lead them into battle. So we would expect Goliath to have said something like, “Am I not the Philistine, and is not Saul the Israelite? Choose him as a man for yourselves” (that is, as your champion) “and let him come down to me.” However, by saying something slightly different, Goliath may be implicitly suggesting that Saul would be afraid to fight him, and so he is willing to fight any other Israelite. In ancient single combat, warrior champions would usually only fight opposing warriors of equal rank and status. Some interpreters infer from the context that Goliath was a prince among the Philistines; some suggest that he could have been the king of the city of Gath. In any event, he was a great warrior of high standing. But by addressing the Israelites as “servants of Saul,” he is indicating that if Saul will not come down and fight him (as he tauntingly suggests he will not), he will fight any Israelite, even a mere “servant.” His words might be understood to mean, “Even though I am the Philistine champion, and you are only servants of Saul, nevertheless, choose for yourselves a man, and let him come down to me, and I will fight with him in single combat, no matter what his rank or status.” Goliath would be boasting that he could defeat any soldier in the Israelite army. But since this meaning is already discernible in the narrative, and since this interpretation is probable but not certain, it may be best to represent Goliath’s actual words in your translation and not interpret them by using an expression such as “even though … nevertheless.”\n\n### What was the “evil” that Eliab believed was in David’s “heart”\n\nIn [17:28](../17/28.md), David’s eldest brother Eliab tells him that he knows “the evil” of David’s “heart.” Eliab is at least accusing David of abandoning his family responsibilities in order to have the thrill of watching a battle (“for you have come down in order to see the battle”). However, his reference to the “evil” in David’s “heart” may suggest something further. Some interpreters believe that Eliab thinks David has been going around asking about the reward for killing Goliath in order to get some soldier or another to take up Goliath’s challenge in the hopes of getting the reward. If that happened, then David would be able to “see” a “battle” between two warrior champions.\n\n### Why did David choose smooth stones?\n\nDavid chose five smooth stones from a nearby brook because that type of stone would fly freely, directly, and forcefully when he slung it. It turned out that he only needed to use one stone to knock Goliath unconscious so that he could run over to him and cut off his head with his own sword.

17:7	aqp9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠לַהֶ֣בֶת חֲנִית֔⁠וֹ	1	The author is using the term **flame** to represent the pointed metal tip of the spear, which flashed in the sunlight.

Alternate translation: [You did not have to come out to array for battle! After all, I am the Philistine, and you, servants of Saul!]
17:8	k5yl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הַ⁠פְּלִשְׁתִּ֗י	1	Goliath could mean either: (1) that he is the Philistine warrior champion, and in that role, as he says in the next verse, he is prepared to do single combat with an Israelite champion. Alternate translation: [the Philistine warrior champion]; (2) that he is a great Philistine warrior with whose exploits and reputation the Israelite soldiers are familiar. The term translated as **the** can have this sense. This would also be a claim that he is a suitable champion to represent all of the Philistines in single combat. Alternate translation: [the great Philistine warrior of whom you have all heard]
17:8	zots		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠אַתֶּם֙ עֲבָדִ֣ים לְ⁠שָׁא֔וּל	1	Goliath is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

If a soldier does answer his challenge, then this pronoun would not include the rest of the soldiers. However, until someone does answer the challenge, it potentially includes all of them. If your language marks a distinction between exclusive and inclusive forms of “us,” decide which one would be appropriate here.

17:12	rxxd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	בָּ֥א	1	The author seems to be using a shorter form of a common expression that people in this culture used to describe a person who was very old. Compare the fuller form in [Joshua 13:1](../../jos/13/01.md), for example, “Now Joshua had aged, he had come into days.” You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language.

17:14	dkea		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הָלְכ֖וּ אַחֲרֵ֥י שָׁאֽוּל	1	The author means that Jesse’s three oldest sons stayed with Saul’s army. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [stayed with Saul’s army]

17:18	xbee		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לְ⁠שָׁל֔וֹם	1	Jesse is using the term **peace** to mean that he wants David to inquire about his brothers’ well-being. That was one thing the term could mean. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [with regard to their well-being] or [to see how they are doing]
17:18	y1ax		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠אֶת־עֲרֻבָּתָ֖⁠ם תִּקָּֽח	1	This could mean: (1) that Jesse wants David to bring back some token from each of his brothers to show that they are alive and well. In this culture, this might have been, for example, a lock of hair. Alternate translation: [and bring something back from each of them to show that they are alive and well]; (2) that Jesse wants David to settle any debts his brothers might have incurred, such as by giving a garment in pledge in exchange for food. Alternate translation: [and settle any debts they may have incurred]

If you follow that interpretation in your translation, end the direct quotation at the end of the previous verse and say “were” instead of **are** here.
17:20	j9xj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וַ⁠יִּשָּׂ֣א	1	The author is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

17:20	v8l6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הַ⁠מַּעְגָּ֔לָ⁠ה	1	The author is using the term **wagon-track** to represent the defensive circle of supply wagons that the Israelites had created around their camp.

David probably means that he hit these animals with his shepherd’s staff; [17:40](../17/40.md) suggests that he was used to using this staff as a weapon. Alternate translation: [and hit it with my staff … and hit it repeatedly]

17:45	wv78		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠שֵׁם֙	1	Here the term **name** could mean: (1) authority. David could be indicating that as a soldier representing the **arrays of Israel**, which **Yahweh** ultimately commands, he is fighting Goliath with a commission from Yahweh, as if Yahweh had authorized him to use his name in order to invoke his authority. Alternate translation: [with the authority of]; (2) reputation. David could be indicating that by defeating Goliath, he will be defending the reputation of Yahweh as the all-powerful God, whom no other god can defeat. (Goliath has just called on his gods to defeat David.) Alternate translation: [to uphold the reputation of]
17:45	haix		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֲשֶׁ֥ר חֵרַֽפְתָּ	1	The context suggests that David is saying that Goliath has **taunted** the **arrays of Israel**, since that is what Goliath himself says in [17:10](../17/10.md), what the Israelite soldiers say in [17:25](../17/25.md), and what David says in [17:26](../17/26.md) and in [17:36](../17/36.md). However, David could also be saying that Goliath has taunted **Yahweh of Armies, the God of the arrays of Israel**, since to say that his armies cannot win is to say that Yahweh is not able to make them win. If you follow that interpretation, use a personal pronoun here. Alternate translation: [whom you have taunted]

Alternate translation: [and he later brought it to Jerusalem and put it in Yahweh’s sanctuary as a trophy of war]; (2) that at this time David brought Goliath’s head to a place near Jerusalem, specifically to Nob, where the sacred tent was at this time.

18:intro	abci				0	# 1 Samuel 18 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the part of the book that describes how David became king ([chapters 16–31](../16/01.md)). It describes how Saul became jealous of David’s success as a military leader and how Saul became suspicious that David was the person whom Yahweh had chosen to become king instead of him. It relates how Saul tried to kill David both directly, by throwing his spear at him, and indirectly, by getting him to fight the Philistines in dangerous situations. But Yahweh protected David and made him successful, so Saul became even more jealous and suspicious.\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetic song in [18:7](../18/07.md).\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Jonathan’s love for David\n\nThe author says in [18:1](../18/01.md) that Jonathan “loved” David. If your language has more than one term for “love,” be sure not to use a term that describes sexual attraction. Biblical Hebrew has specific language for sexual desire, and the author does not use that language here. Rather, he says that “the soul of Jonathan was bound with the soul of David.” By this he means that Jonathan recognized that David was a man who was like him in terms of character, and so he wanted to be his friend. (As a traditional saying puts it, “A friend is another self.”) Jonathan had demonstrated bold faith and strong trust in Yahweh by attacking the Philistine garrison in [chapter 14](../14/01.md), and David had demonstrated the same things by fighting Goliath in [chapter 17](../17/01.md). So Jonathan recognized David as a man of courage and daring, and he knew that if they were friends, they would encourage each other to trust Yahweh and continue to do bold exploits. If your language has a word for friendship-love, it would be appropriate to use that word here in your translation. You could also use a word for unselfish love. (One ancient Greek version uses the verb here from which the New Testament writers developed the noun agape for unselfish love.)\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### “I am lightly esteemed” ([18:23](../18/23.md))\n\nIn [18:23](../18/23.md), when Saul’s servants tell David that Saul will allow him to marry his daughter Michal, David replies, “I am a poor man, and I am lightly esteemed.” Since the servants tell David in [18:22](../18/22.md) that they all love him, and the author says in [18:16](../18/16.md) that all the Israelites loved David, it seems unlikely that David means that he is lightly esteemed by people in general or by the people in Saul’s court specifically. Instead, David may be referring implicitly to the way Saul previously promised to allow him to marry his other daughter Merab but then allowed a different man, Adriel the Meholathite, to marry her instead. In other words, David may mean, “I am lightly esteemed by King Saul.” (Some interpreters suggest that Adriel may have offered a large bride-price for Merab and that is why Saul let him marry her. This would explain why David says he is “a poor man” himself.) However, in this culture, a person would not complain explicitly that the king had treated him with disrespect or disregard. That is why David makes what seems to be an indirect statement to that effect. You may find a way to suggest this meaning implicitly in your translation.

Saul’s different requirement of **a hundred foreskins of Philistines** had both practical and symbolic significance. Since Israelite men were circumcised but Philistine men were not, this requirement ensured that David could not bring back the heads of slain Israelites and claim they were Philistines. Beyond that, as [14:6](../14/06.md), [17:26](../17/26.md), and [17:36](../17/36.md) show, Israelites used the word “uncircumcised” as a derogatory term indicating that the Philistines did not worship Yahweh and did not obey his laws. So bringing back their foreskins as war trophies would symbolically show that Saul was being **avenged** on these **enemies** who were also hostile to Yahweh. (Saul tells David in [18:17](../18/17.md) that he is sending him out to fight “the battles of Yahweh.”) Alternate translation: [except that you kill a hundred Philistines and bring back their foreskins to prove that it was indeed these uncircumcised heathen whom you killed]

19:intro	abcj				0	# 1 Samuel 19 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the part of the book that describes how David became king ([chapters 16–31](../16/01.md)). It describes how, after promising not to harm David, Saul once again became jealous of David’s success as a military leader. This led Saul to try once again to kill David, both indirectly, by sending soldiers to kill him, and directly, by ordering soldiers to bring David to him and by pursuing David in person. But Yahweh continued to protect David so that he could survive and eventually become the next king of Israel.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### What was the “teraphim” that Michal had in her home?\n\nIn [19:13](../19/13.md), the author says that Michal took a “teraphim” that she had in her home and put it in David’s bed under a covering to make it look as if David was there. She did that to help David escape. Teraphim were idols that people kept in their homes. While contexts such as [Genesis 31:34](../../gen/31/34.md) suggest that in some cases they were small, the context in this chapter shows that the teraphim Michal had was the size of a man. It appears that Michal worshiped this idol in some way. But that does not mean that David did. Samuel said in [13:14](../13/14.md) that Yahweh considered David to be “a man according to his heart” who would do all that he commanded. So we may be confident that David was wholeheartedly devoted to Yahweh and worshiped only him, even though his wife unfortunately kept an idol in their home.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### “Naioth”\n\nThe author says in [19:18](../19/18.md) that David and Samuel “stayed in Naioth.” The word “Naioth” is not attested as a place name in any other passage of the Bible or in any historical sources. The term means “dwellings,” and it seems to refer to a cluster of lodgings that had been built near Ramah for young prophets whom Samuel was training. Samuel apparently felt that David would be safer within a community of people, and he may also have hoped that Saul would not seek to harm David within an area that was dedicated to a sacred purpose. While Naioth may have become the name of these lodgings, it might also have been a descriptive term, and the author may be using it in that way. So instead of saying “in Naioth,” you might choose to say something such as “among the lodgings of the young prophets.” If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, consider what it says.\n\n### “Is Saul among the prophets?” ([19:24](../19/24.md))\n\nIn [10:12](../10/12.md), the author describes the origin of this short popular saying. Originally people in the culture applied it to situations in which a person did something that was surprising in light of his upbringing or family of origin. In [19:24](../19/24.md), the author describes how this saying came to be applied to a further type of situation, one in which a person did something that was very unexpected. You could indicate that explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. The UST models one way to do that.

20:intro	abck				0	# 1 Samuel 20 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the part of the book that describes how David became king ([chapters 16–31](../16/01.md)). It describes how David’s friend Jonathan found out for certain that his father Saul intended to kill David and how Jonathan devised a secret way to warn David that he was in danger and that he should flee for his life.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Why did Saul assume that his son Jonathan would be the next king?\n\nIn [20:31](../20/31.md), Saul says to his son Jonathan that “all of the days that the son of Jesse lives on the earth, you will not be established, nor your kingdom.” Saul is assuming that Jonathan will be king after him unless David takes his place. He assumes this because in the ancient Near East, it was usually a king’s oldest son who became king after his death. Jonathan was Saul’s oldest son. But throughout the Old Testament, we see Yahweh accomplishing his purposes by doing things other than in the customary ways of a culture. Jonathan knew and understood this. He tells David in [23:17](../23/17.md) that he expects David to be the next king but that he will be his most important official and advisor. Jonathan did not know that he would be killed in battle before this could happen.\n\n### Why did David flee from Naioth after Yahweh had protected him there?\n\nEven though, as the author describes in [19:19–24](../19/19.md), Yahweh protected David at Naioth in a supernatural way, we learn in [20:1](../20/01.md) that “David fled from Naioth.” He seems to have been concerned that someone who was not open to Yahweh’s influence in the way that Saul and his messengers clearly were would come to try to capture him. David was right, as an ungodly man, Doeg the Edomite, killed all the priests of Yahweh in [22:18–19](../22/18.md). However, it is not necessary to explain this reason in the text of your translation or in a footnote, since the reason becomes clear later in the story.\n\n### What was Jonathan doing with the arrows ([20:20–22](../20/20.md) and 35–40)?\n\nBy shooting arrows near the rock where he told David to hide, Jonathan provided a signal for David of whether or not he was safe. Even if David could not hear what Jonathan was saying to the boy, if he saw the boy turn around and head back toward Jonathan, then he would know that he too could return safely to the city and to Saul’s court. Similarly, if he saw the boy running farther away after Jonathan called out to him, then he too needed flee for safety.\n\n### Why did Jonathan give his seat to Abner ([20:25](../20/25.md))?\n\nIt is possible that Jonathan was showing special courtesy and honor to Abner, Saul’s cousin and general, by giving up his seat next to his father Saul and letting Abner sit there. But it’s more likely that by seeming to do this, he was actually putting some distance between himself and his father Saul, expecting that Saul might become upset when he learned that Jonathan had given David permission not to be present. In [20:33](../20/33.md), the story shows that this was a good idea, since it gave Jonathan more time to get out of the way of the spear that Saul threw at him.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Why did Jonathan make “the enemies of David” accountable for David’s actions?\n\nIn [20:16](../20/16.md), when Jonathan has David promise not to harm his descendants, he says, “And may Yahweh seek from the hand of the enemies of David!” This means, “If you break this promise, may Yahweh punish your enemies!” It does not immediately make sense why Jonathan would say “the enemies of David” rather than “David.” Since this is a binding oath, the sense is that Yahweh will hold David accountable for keeping it. Yahweh would punish David, not David’s enemies, if David broke the oath. Interpreters have different understandings of why Jonathan says “the enemies of David.” It is possible that a person in this culture would not directly threaten another person with divine retribution, especially if they were on good terms. So Jonathan may be speaking indirectly. Other interpreters suggest that out of reverence for David, later scribes may have substituted the phrase about his enemies for a direct reference to David’s name. In both explanations, someone is being polite and respectful to David. But if the meaning would not be clear in this polite form, you could state it directly in your translation. You might have Jonathan say, for example, “And may Yahweh seek from the hand of David.”

20:19	enlt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בְּ⁠י֣וֹם הַֽ⁠מַּעֲשֶׂ֑ה	1	Jonathan assumes that David will know that by **the day of the deed**, he means the time when Saul first tried to kill David, since Jonathan told David then, “stay in a secret place and hide yourself” ([19:2](../19/02.md)). You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [at the time when my father first tried to kill you]
20:19	pgo3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	אֵ֖צֶל הָ⁠אֶ֥בֶן הָ⁠אָֽזֶל	1	The name **Ezel** is the name of a stone. The name Ezel means “departure.” It is possible that the stone got this name because it was the place where David and Jonathan parted from one another, as [20:41–42](../20/41.md) describes. If so, the author would be using the later name while presenting what Jonathan said here, even though the stone did not have that name at this time. (The author does something similar with the name Ebenezer in [4:1](../04/01.md).) If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain this in a footnote.

Alternate translation: [If I clearly say]

Alternate translation: [since Yahweh has sent you away, go]
20:22	xk7n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	שִֽׁלַּחֲ⁠ךָ֖ יְהוָֽה	1	Jonathan means that under these circumstances, Yahweh would be sending David away for his own safety. He is not saying that Yahweh does not want David to be at the royal court. Saul, through his own jealousy and suspicion, is responsible for making it unsafe for David to be there. Alternate translation: [Yahweh has sent you away for your own safety]
20:23	ttqd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠הַ֨⁠דָּבָ֔ר אֲשֶׁ֥ר דִּבַּ֖רְנוּ אֲנִ֣י וָ⁠אָ֑תָּה	1	Jonathan is using the term **word** to represent the promises he and David have made to each other.

20:25	mxw3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	כְּ⁠פַ֣עַם ׀ בְּ⁠פַ֗עַם	1	The author is using a common expression of his culture that means “as usual” or “as was customary.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly.

20:25	j7m4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	אֶל־מוֹשַׁב֙ הַ⁠קִּ֔יר	1	In this culture, as in many cultures, certain seats at a table were considered places of honor. The **seat by the wall** was the place of greatest honor at this table. (The context suggests that the table was long and extended out from the wall.) Sitting in that seat was a symbolic action by which Saul indicated his status as king. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of his action. Your language may have an appropriate expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: [at the head of the table, since that was the place of greatest honor]

20:26	uwfi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אָמַר֙	1	Saul did not say these words out loud. Rather, this was what he thought to himself. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could make this explicit in your translation. Alternate translation: [he said to himself] or [he thought]
20:26	d6do		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	בִּלְתִּ֥י טָה֛וֹר ה֖וּא כִּֽי־לֹ֥א טָהֽוֹר	1	In this instance, Saul is actually not repeating the word **clean** for emphasis. Instead, the author is showing how Saul talked himself into this conclusion. So it would be appropriate to repeat the word in your translation.
20:27	hgm7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֗י	1	The author is introducing a new development in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new development.

20:27	asu8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	הַ⁠שֵּׁנִ֔י	1	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use a cardinal number here or an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: [day two] or [the following day]
20:27	i7yh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	בֶן־יִשַׁ֛י	1	Saul could have referred to David by his name, or he could have respectfully called him “my son-in-law.” But he seems to call him **the son of Jesse** in front of his guests in order to suggest that David is of lowly origin and should not take for granted the opportunity to dine at the king’s table. So we recommend that you do not use the name David in place of the phrase Saul uses. It may be possible to represent this phrase in such a way as to indicate Saul’s tone and intention. Alternate translation: [that son of Jesse]
20:27	vtb7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֶל־הַ⁠לָּֽחֶם	1	See how you translated this expression in [20:24](../20/24.md). Alternate translation: [to the feast]

If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing emphasis. Alternate translation: [David earnestly asked]
20:28	uok9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	עַד־בֵּ֥ית לָֽחֶם	1	The author is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

Alternate translation: [He asked me if I would please let him go, since the sacrifice of his clan is in that city, and his brother himself had commanded him. He asked me to allow him, if he had found favor in my eyes, please to go away and see his brothers]
20:29	ovqw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	אָחִ֔⁠י	1	The context suggests that this would be David’s oldest brother. If your language marks that distinction, you may wish to indicate that in your translation.

20:31	enkd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	לֹ֥א תִכּ֖וֹן אַתָּ֣ה וּ⁠מַלְכוּתֶ֑⁠ךָ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in an active form or in another way that is natural in your language. The sense is the same as in [13:13](../13/13.md), where Samuel uses an active form. Alternate translation: [Yahweh will not establish you, nor will he establish your kingdom]
20:31	uwuv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	לֹ֥א תִכּ֖וֹן אַתָּ֣ה וּ⁠מַלְכוּתֶ֑⁠ךָ	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Saul is using them together for emphasis.

In this case, Saul means that David is characterized by death, that is, he deserves to die. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [he deserves to die]

21:intro	abcl				0	# 1 Samuel 21 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the part of the book that describes how David became king ([chapters 16–31](../16/01.md)). It describes how David fled hastily from Saul’s court in Gibeah in order to save his life. It first tells how he went to the city of Nob, where the Israelite priests were with the Box of Yahweh, and asked for food and a weapon. It then tells how he fled to the Philistine city of Gath, where Saul presumably could not attack him. However, the officials of the king of Gath did not want to have David, a great Israelite military commander, in their city. David pretended to be crazy so that they would not feel threatened by him.\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetic song in [21:11](../21/11.md).

22:intro	abcm				0	# 1 Samuel 22 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the part of the book that describes how David became king ([chapters 16–31](../16/01.md)). It describes how David fled from the Philistine city of Gath when he no longer felt safe there. He brought his parents to the king of Moab for safety and stayed in Moab himself for a while. But then Yahweh’s prophet Gad told him to return to the land of Judah. There he gathered a force of 400 men, including his older brothers, and became their commander. This chapter also describes how Saul accused the Israelite priests of conspiring with David against him and had one of his officials kill all of them.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Saul and the chief priest and his family\n\nOne of Saul’s officials, Doeg the Edomite, tells Saul that Ahimelech the high priest gave David food and a sword and asked Yahweh to guide him. Saul summoned the priests and accused them of encouraging David to rebel against him. This was a serious accusation. The priests had an obligation to represent Yahweh and support his purposes. They would have been rebelling against Yahweh’s king if this accusation had been true. But it was not. Nevertheless, Saul had Doeg kill all the priests and their families. Only one young man escaped to tell David. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/highpriest]])

23:intro	abcn				0	# 1 Samuel 23 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the part of the book that describes how David became king ([chapters 16–31](../16/01.md)). It describes how David rescued the city of Keilah from the Philistines who were stealing their harvest. Saul then went to Keilah to capture David, but Yahweh warned David and he fled to the wilderness near Ziph. Saul chased David there, and he would have caught him, but he had to leave to fight the Philistines, who were invading Israel.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### David trusts Yahweh to protect him\n\nWhile the author does not state this specifically but leaves it for readers to recognize on their own, Yahweh worked out the timing of all these circumstances in order to rescue David from being captured and killed. Saul wanted to kill David, but David trusted in Yahweh, and Yahweh kept rescuing him. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/trust]])

24:intro	abco				0	# 1 Samuel 24 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the part of the book that describes how David became king ([chapters 16–31](../16/01.md)). It describes how Saul, after fighting off the Philistines, returned to the wilderness to try to capture David and kill him. Instead, David got the opportunity to kill Saul, but he did not do so, since Yahweh had anointed Saul to be the king. David proved to Saul that he could have killed him, and Saul realized that David was not his enemy and said that he would become king after him.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### “pens of sheep”\n\nThe author says in [24:3](../24/03.md) that Saul came to some “pens of sheep” along the roadway. These were enclosures that shepherds had created in this area by building circular stone walls outside the openings of caves. The sheep stayed within the enclosures in good weather during the day, and they could go inside the caves for warmth and shelter at night and during storms. Describe these enclosures with a term or phrase that would help your readers understand what they were.\n\n### Why did David cut off the edge of Saul’s robe?\n\nIn [24:4](../24/04.md), David cuts off the edge of Saul’s robe. Shortly afterwards, he is able to show this piece of the robe as proof that he could have killed Saul but did not. But this action may have had further symbolic significance. In [15:27–28](../15/27.md), Saul tears off the edge of Samuel’s robe as he is trying to keep him from leaving. Samuel replies, “Yahweh has torn the kingdom of Israel from upon you today.” If David had learned of this incident, he may have been showing Saul that Samuel’s prophecy was coming true as Yahweh preserved his life so that he could be the next king. However, as the author does not make this point explicitly, we recommend that you do not say anything about it in the text of your translation or in a footnote. This repeated imagery speaks for itself within the story, and you can let it do that in your translation.\n\n### What does the proverb mean that David quotes to Saul?\n\nIn [24:13](../24/13.md), David says to Saul, “As the proverb of the ancient says, ‘From the wicked comes out wickedness.’” He is using this proverb to mean, “If I had been a wicked person, I would have wickedly killed you in the cave.

24:2	zx9k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וַ⁠יֵּ֗לֶךְ	1	The author is using Saul to represent himself and all his men in the act of traveling. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a plural pronoun to indicate this. Alternate translation: [And they went]

24:2	zjx2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עַל־פְּנֵ֖י	1	These cliffs contained many caves where David could have been hiding, and the author means that Saul went to search for David in the caves that opened up onto the **face** or slopes of the cliffs. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [in the caves in]
24:3	lgdr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	לְ⁠הָסֵ֣ךְ אֶת־רַגְלָ֑י⁠ו	1	The author is speaking in a polite way about a private or uncomfortable matter. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: [to relieve himself]

(Jonathan’s concern for his own descendants shows that people in this culture expected a king to destroy any enemies who could threaten him.) To show that this is not necessarily something that Yahweh said to David directly, you could make this an indirect quotation, as suggested in the Quotes in Quotes note, even if your language can present one direct quotation within another.

Alternate translation: [Profane to me from Yahweh, that I have done this thing to my master]

(In [26:8](../26/08.md), Abishai tells David that directly when David gets another opportunity to kill Saul.) If that is the case, then the author is describing one event before describing another event that preceded it. In your translation, you may wish to relate these events in the order in which they would have happened. Alternate translation: [And David did not allow his men to arise against Saul, but he dispersed them with words]
24:7	be2m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יְשַׁסַּ֨ע דָּוִ֤ד אֶת־אֲנָשָׁי⁠ו֙	1	In its few other uses in the Hebrew Bible, the term translated as **dispersed** means to tear in pieces or to divide. Here it could mean: (1) that David’s men had gathered in a large group in preparation to attack Saul, but by refusing to allow them to do that, David caused them to move back into various parts of the cave in smaller groups. The ULT suggests this meaning. (2) that David spoke harshly to his men to keep them from attacking Saul. In that case, the author would be speaking of David’s action as if he had slashed at the crowd of men the way someone might slash a sacrificial animal in order to divide it into pieces. Alternate translation: [And David rebuked his men]; (3) that David restrained his men. Some interpreters believe that the text originally had a word with this meaning that was altered in the process of transmission. Alternate translation: [And David restrained his men]
24:7	y50h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בַּ⁠דְּבָרִ֔ים	1	The author is using the term **words** to represent what David said by using words. The author could be referring to: (1) what David said in the previous verse. Alternate translation: [by saying this]; (2) something further that David said to keep his men from killing Saul themselves. Alternate translation: [by persuading them that they too should respect Saul as Yahweh’s anointed]

The author says that he **arose** from the cave to indicate that he left the cave and continued his search for David once he had finished relieving himself. Alternate translation: [And Saul moved on from the cave]
24:8	nf14		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	אֲדֹנִ֣⁠י הַ⁠מֶּ֑לֶךְ	1	David is referring to Saul by a respectful title. Use a comparable title or expression for addressing someone of high status respectfully in your language. Alternate translation: [Your Majesty]

24:14	gnd0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אַֽחֲרֵי֙ כֶּ֣לֶב מֵ֔ת	1	David is speaking as if he were actually a **dead dog**. In this culture, wild dogs were considered dirty, and they were regarded with contempt. Moreover, a **dead dog** would be powerless. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [After someone who is powerless and whom people regard with contempt!]

25:intro	abcp				0	# 1 Samuel 25 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the part of the book that describes how David became king ([chapters 16–31](../16/01.md)). It describes David and his men protected the extensive flocks of a man named Nabal who lived in the southern part of the territory of Judah. When David then reasonably asked for some food from a feast that Nabal was holding to celebrate the shearing of his sheep, Nabal rudely refused him. This made David so angry that he wanted to kill all the men in Nabal’s household. But Nabal’s prudent wife Abigail sent very generous portions of food to David, and she convinced him not to attack and kill those men, persuading him that if he did, he would deeply regret that when he became king.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Sheep-shearing\n\nPeople in ancient Israel who owned sheep would cut off their wool when the weather started to get warm so that they could use the wool to make clothing, blankets, and other articles. The sheep would eventually grow back another thick coat of wool, but in the meantime they would stay cool in the warmer weather. Cutting the wool of sheep is called “shearing” them. Sheep-shearing was like a time of harvest, since it gave sheep owners and their workers benefits in return for the hard work they had done caring for their sheep. So it was also a time of celebration. Sheep owners would reward those who had helped care for their flocks by hosting them at banquets. When someone told David that Nabal was shearing his sheep, David therefore thought it was reasonable for him to ask Nabal for some of the food from the banquet he knew Nabal would be hosting. David and his men had protected Nabal’s shepherds and flocks while they were in the area and, as a result, Nabal got even more wool from his flocks than usual, since he had suffered no losses due to theft or wild-animal attacks. In ancient Israelite culture, this kind of protection was understood to have created an obligation of hospitality and sharing, especially during times of celebration like sheep-shearing. David’s request was therefore not just a matter of charity but was based on the established social customs and the practical services that he and his men had provided to Nabal. It was outrageous for Nabal to deny David this recognition of his help and this well-deserved share in the banquet. That is why David became so angry with Nabal.

Alternate translation: [Yahweh will surely make for you, my master, an established house]

When she says that evil will not be **found**, she means that it will not be able to be found because it will not be there. See how you translated the similar expression in [9:8](../09/08.md). Alternate translation: [And there will be no evil in you]
25:28	qros		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וְ⁠רָעָ֛ה לֹא־תִמָּצֵ֥א בְ⁠ךָ֖	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **evil**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [And you will not be guilty of having done something very wrong]

She knows that Saul has been pursuing David and seeking to kill him. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, then you could translate this as a confident statement. Alternate translation: [Even though a man has arisen to pursue you and to seek your life, the life of my master will nevertheless be bound in the bundle of the living by Yahweh your God]

The point of comparison is that Yahweh will do this suddenly and powerfully, the way a stone comes out of a sling. (Abigail seems to be making an allusion to the way David was able to kill Goliath with a stone from a sling, reminding him of Yahweh’s protection at that time.) If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [he will end it suddenly and powerfully]

25:35	akjs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וָ⁠אֶשָּׂ֖א פָּנָֽיִ⁠ךְ	1	David is using the expression **lifted up your face** to represent he has granted Abigail’s request. In this culture, a supplicant would look down at the ground in front of a superior, and the superior would reach down and lift up the person’s face if he were going to grant the request. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [so I have granted your request]
25:36	memz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כְּ⁠מִשְׁתֵּ֣ה הַ⁠מֶּ֗לֶךְ	1	The point of this comparison is that just as a king would serve an abundance of fine food and drink at a feast, so Nabal had prepared a very lavish celebration.

Instead, as in the previous verse, the term probably describes his feelings. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: [And he lost all heart] or [And he became terribly upset]
25:37	q99q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠ה֖וּא הָיָ֥ה לְ⁠אָֽבֶן	1	The author is speaking of Nabal as if he had turned into a **stone**.

However, the author is saying that Yahweh caused this so that Nabal would die. Since it is not clear exactly what happened in medical terms, you may wish to state this generally in your translation.

25:41	da62		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	אֲמָֽתְ⁠ךָ֙	1	The word **your** is singular here because Abigail is addressing David through his messengers. So use the singular form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.

25:42	t5yd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הַ⁠הֹלְכ֖וֹת לְ⁠רַגְלָ֑⁠הּ	1	The author is using the expression **at her feet** to represent that Abigail’s young women walked behind her. (Even though Abigail was riding a donkey, the author is speaking as if she was walking on her **feet**.) See how you translated the similar expression in [25:27](../25/27.md). Alternate translation: [followed her]

The ULT reflects this understanding. Alternate translation: [And David married Ahinoam from Jezreel]; (2) that David had already married Ahinoam at some previous time. Some interpreters believe that this is the case because Ahinoam is named first in the list of David’s sons and their mothers in [2 Samuel 3:2](../../2sa/03/02.md). (However, other interpreters believe that is because she bore David his first son, not necessarily because he married her first.) Alternate translation: [And David had married Ahinoam from Jezreel]

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: [But Saul had given his daughter Michal, the wife of David, to Palti the son of Laish as his wife, to show that he no longer wanted to have anything to do with David, his former son-in-law]
26:intro	abcq				0	# 1 Samuel 26 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the part of the book that describes how David became king ([chapters 16–31](../16/01.md)). It describes how David got a second opportunity to kill Saul when Saul once again pursued him into the wilderness. Once again David did not kill him, since Yahweh had anointed Saul to be the king. David proved to Saul once more that he could have killed him, and Saul admitted that he had been wrong to pursue David and promised that he would never harm him.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Why did David take Saul’s spear and water jug?\n\nAs in the case of David cutting off the edge of Saul’s robe [24:4](../24/04.md), when David took the spear and water jug that were near Saul’s head ([26:11](../26/11.md)), he was able shortly afterwards to show these items as proof that he could have killed Saul but did not. But in this case as in that earlier case, this action may have had further symbolic significance. As [22:6](../22/06.md) shows, the spear was an emblem of Saul’s royal office. The water jar may have been a similar emblem. In some ancient cultures, an important official accompanying the king would carry a beautiful and valuable jug containing water for the king to use to wash his hands before eating and for other personal purposes. The context suggests that it was the duty of Abner, as Saul’s general, to carry this jug with him and present it to Saul whenever he wanted to use the water in it. By taking these royal emblems, David may have been dramatizing how the kingship would pass from Saul to him. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain this possibility in a footnote.

If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [David is hiding himself on the hill of Hakilah, on the face of Jeshimon!]
26:1	r5ay		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	עַ֖ל פְּנֵ֥י הַ⁠יְשִׁימֹֽן	1	The Ziphites are using the term **on the face of** to represent in front of or opposite.

26:2	rbgc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	בְּחוּרֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [whom he had chosen from throughout Israel]
26:3	r1yy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יַּ֕רְא	1	The author is using the term **saw** to represent that David learned this, since people often learn things by seeing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [And he learned]
26:4	cwp3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	אֶל־נָכֽוֹן	1	See how you translated the similar phrase in [23:23](../23/23.md). Alternate translation: [as something that he had confirmed]

If so, you can shorten them. Alternate translation: [where Saul had camped … where Saul lay]
26:5	mqij		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠אַבְנֵ֥ר בֶּן־נֵ֖ר שַׂר־צְבָא֑⁠וֹ	1	The author is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: [and Abner, the son of Ner, the commander of his army, lay nearby]
26:5	fy6j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בַּ⁠מַּעְגָּ֔ל	1	The author is using the term **within the wagon-track** to represent within the defensive circle of supply wagons around the camp. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [within the defensive circle of supply wagons around the camp]
26:5	xnud		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠הָ⁠עָ֖ם	1	As he has done frequently in previous chapters, the author is using the term **people** here to mean soldiers. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [and his soldiers]
26:6	r1bj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יַּ֨עַן דָּוִ֜ד וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר	1	Here the author is using **answered** to express that David was responding to seeing Saul asleep in the camp.

Alternate translation: [And David answered Ahimelech]
26:6	gkv3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	צְרוּיָ֜ה	1	The word **Zeruiah** is the name of a woman. She was David’s older sister. (So the author is identifying Abishai, not Zeruiah, as the **brother of Joab**.)
26:6	n105		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אֲנִ֖י אֵרֵ֥ד עִמָּֽ⁠ךְ	1	Abishai is stating the pronoun **I** separately, even though the verb translated as **I will go down** already includes this meaning. He is doing that because he is emphasizing his agreement to accompany David down to Saul’s camp. If a speaker of your language would use an explicit pronoun for the same purpose, you may want to use that construction in your translation. If not, your language may have other ways of showing the meaning here. Alternate translation: [I agree to go down with you]
26:7	ayo6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠הִנֵּ֣ה	1	The author is using the term **behold** to focus his readers’ attention on what he is about to say. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. See how you translated the term in [2:31](../02/31.md).
26:7	vfqh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וַ⁠חֲנִית֥⁠וֹ מְעוּכָֽה־בָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ מראשת⁠ו	1	Displaying the **spear** in this way was a symbolic action that identified Saul as the king, similarly to the way Saul held this spear in his hand in [22:6](../22/06.md) when he was holding court. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: [and his spear was pressed into the ground by his head to identify him as the king]
26:7	ib80		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וַ⁠חֲנִית֥⁠וֹ מְעוּכָֽה־בָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

26:8	v44p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠יָדֶ֑⁠ךָ	1	The author is using the term **hand** to represent power or control. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [into your control]
26:8	swtb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠לֹ֥א אֶשְׁנֶ֖ה לֽ⁠וֹ	1	Abishai is not asking David for just one chance to kill Saul and promising that he will let Saul live if he fails to kill him the first time. He means that he will not need to strike Saul more than once, since the first blow will kill him. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [And I will not need to strike him a second time]
26:9	fmee		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	אַל־תַּשְׁחִיתֵ֑⁠הוּ כִּ֠י מִ֣י שָׁלַ֥ח יָד֛⁠וֹ בִּ⁠מְשִׁ֥יחַ יְהוָ֖ה וְ⁠נִקָּֽה	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: [Who has stretched out his hand against the anointed one of Yahweh and been innocent? So do not destroy him]
26:9	d94w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מִ֣י שָׁלַ֥ח יָד֛⁠וֹ בִּ⁠מְשִׁ֥יחַ יְהוָ֖ה וְ⁠נִקָּֽה	1	David is using the question form for emphasis.

Alternate translation: [no one has stretched out his hand against the anointed one of Yahweh and been innocent!]
26:9	no3p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	כִּ֠י מִ֣י שָׁלַ֥ח יָד֛⁠וֹ בִּ⁠מְשִׁ֥יחַ יְהוָ֖ה	1	David is using a common expression of his culture to mean attacking or harming someone.

26:9	s6ar		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	בִּ⁠מְשִׁ֥יחַ יְהוָ֖ה	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

26:10	vn5h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	חַי־יְהוָ֔ה	1	At the beginning of this quotation, David starts to swear an oath that he will not kill Saul, as he does say in the next verse. But in the rest of this verse, he says what will happen instead. It may be more natural in your language to put this phrase at the end of this verse so that it will directly precede what David swears in the next verse.
26:10	alnh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יְהוָ֖ה יִגָּפֶ֑⁠נּוּ	1	By **strike him**, David means that Yahweh will kill Saul. See how you translated the similar phrase in [4:2](../04/02.md). Alternate translation: [Yahweh will kill him]
26:10	qqx4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֽוֹ־יוֹמ֤⁠וֹ יָבוֹא֙ וָ⁠מֵ֔ת	1	David is using the term **his day** to represent the time when Saul will die.

26:10	ez7s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠נִסְפָּֽה	1	David is speaking as if battle were a flood that could sweep Saul away. See how you translated the similar phrase in [12:25](../12/25.md). Alternate translation: [and be destroyed] or [and it will destroy him]

26:11	wr4e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מִ⁠שְּׁלֹ֥חַ יָדִ֖⁠י בִּ⁠מְשִׁ֣יחַ יְהוָ֑ה	1	David is using a common expression of his culture, **stretch out my hand**, to mean attacking or harming someone. See how you translated the similar phrase in [24:6](../24/06.md). Alternate translation: [to attack the anointed one of Yahweh] or [to use violence against the anointed one of Yahweh]
26:11	c4bj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	בִּ⁠מְשִׁ֣יחַ יְהוָ֑ה	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [the one whom Yahweh has anointed]

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: [take the spear that is by his head and the jug of water to show that we could have killed him but chose not to]
26:11	i7u1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	וְ⁠נֵ֥לֲכָה לָּֽ⁠נוּ	1	After saying **let us go**, David uses the pronoun **ourselves** to emphasize that there is benefit for him and Abishai in doing that. He means that the two of them should leave before any of the soldiers awake and they are discovered and captured. Use a way that is natural in your language to indicate this emphasis. Alternate translation: [and let us get out of here!]
26:12	a1hq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יִּקַּח֩ דָּוִ֨ד	1	The author is using one person who was involved in this action, David, who requested it, to represent another person who was involved, Abishai, who took the items at David’s request. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [So Abishai took for David]

Alternate translation: [And because a deep sleep of Yahweh had fallen on them, so all of them were sleeping, thus none was seeing, and none was knowing, and none was awakening]
26:12	w9dg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	תַּרְדֵּמַ֣ת יְהוָ֔ה נָפְלָ֖ה עֲלֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	The author is speaking as if **sleep** were an object that could have **fallen** on these soldiers.

26:13	t1ey		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	עַל־רֹאשׁ־הָ⁠הָ֖ר	1	The author is speaking as if the top of this **hill** were actually its **head**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [on top of a hill] or [high up on a hill]
26:14	hi8f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֨א דָוִ֜ד אֶל־הָ⁠עָ֗ם וְ⁠אֶל & אַבְנֵ֑ר	1	This expression conveys a single idea by using two phrases connected with **and**. The phrase **to the people** tells among whom David called **to Abner**. Alternate translation: [And David called to Abner among the people]
26:14	n1bb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	אַבְנֵ֤ר & הֲ⁠ל֥וֹא תַעֲנֶ֖ה	1	David is using the question form for emphasis.

In your translation, use a natural way of introducing direct quotations in your language. It may not be necessary to represent this expression explicitly. Alternate translation: [And Abner replied]
26:14	lhoa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	קָרָ֥אתָ אֶל־הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ	1	By **call to the king**, Abner does not mean that David has called out to Saul. The author describes how David called out to him by name. Rather, Abner means to ask who is calling out so as to disturb the king’s sleep.

If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [You are a man!

26:15	q75p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הֲ⁠לוֹא־אִ֣ישׁ אַתָּ֗ה	1	By **a man**, David means a great warrior. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [Are you not a great warrior?] or [You are a great warrior!]
26:15	af00		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	כִּי	1	Here the word **For** introduces not a reason but an explanation. Alternate translation: [I say this because]

26:16	nha0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	מְשִׁ֣יחַ יְהוָ֑ה	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [the one whom Yahweh has anointed]
26:16	zk17		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠עַתָּ֣ה	1	**And now** was a common expression that speakers in this culture used to introduce their main topic. David is using it to introduce his proof that someone could have killed Saul that night. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. See how you translated this expression in [6:7](../06/07.md). Alternate translation: [Let me prove to you that someone could have killed the king tonight]
26:16	do49		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וְ⁠עַתָּ֣ה ׀ רְאֵ֗ה אֵֽי־חֲנִ֥ית הַ⁠מֶּ֛לֶךְ וְ⁠אֶת־צַפַּ֥חַת הַ⁠מַּ֖יִם אֲשֶׁ֥ר מראשת⁠ו	1	David is using the question form for emphasis.

Alternate translation: [And now, see, someone has taken the spear of the king and the jar of water that were by his head!]
26:16	tlyt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠עַתָּ֣ה ׀ רְאֵ֗ה אֵֽי־חֲנִ֥ית הַ⁠מֶּ֛לֶךְ וְ⁠אֶת־צַפַּ֥חַת הַ⁠מַּ֖יִם אֲשֶׁ֥ר מראשת⁠ו	1	This could mean: (1) that David is telling Abner to look around Saul and see that the spear and jar are missing. The ULT reflects this meaning. (2) that David is holding up the spear and jar and telling Abner to see that he has them. Alternate translation: [And now, see where the spear of the king and the jar of water are that were by his head!]
26:17	dy9b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠קוֹלְ⁠ךָ֥ זֶ֖ה בְּנִ֣⁠י דָוִ֑ד	1	Saul is using the question form for emphasis.

26:17	kpew		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	בְּנִ֣⁠י דָוִ֑ד	1	In the similar episode in [24:16](../24/16.md), Saul seemed to be using this same expression to reaffirm David as his own son-in-law, after he had been referring to him dismissively as “the son of Jesse.” By this point, however, Saul has repudiated David as his son-in-law by giving his daughter Michal to another man ([25:44](../25/44.md).) So here **my son** is probably a term of endearment rather than a kinship term. Alternate translation: [my dear David]
26:17	oqbv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	קוֹלִ֖⁠י	1	David is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

Alternate translation: [what have I done, and what evil action have I committed]
26:18	wkzh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	מֶ֣ה עָשִׂ֔יתִי וּ⁠מַה־בְּ⁠יָדִ֖⁠י רָעָֽה	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine them. Alternate translation: [what wrong have I done]

26:19	f7m2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	יָרַ֣ח מִנְחָ֔ה	1	David is using the term **smell** to represent accept. In the Israelite sacrificial system, when Yahweh accepted an offering, he was understood to be pleased with its smell.

27:intro	abcr				0	# 1 Samuel 27 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the part of the book that describes how David became king ([chapters 16–31](../16/01.md)). It describes how David fled for a second time to the Philistine city of Gath for safety. This time Achish, the king of Gath, agreed to let David live there and serve him. David and his men went on raids against other people groups in the area but told Achish that they had attacked Israelite communities. This made Achish think that David would not be able to go back to Israel and so David would always serve him.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Why did David leave Israel even after Saul promised not to kill him?\n\nEven though Saul promised in [26:21](../26/21.md) that he would never kill David, nevertheless David fled to Philistia for safety immediately afterwards. It seems that David did not trust Saul to keep his promise. David had good reason not to trust Saul. In [19:6](../19/06.md), Saul swore an oath by Yahweh that he would not kill David, but shortly afterwards, when Saul learned of David’s great military success against the Philistines, he became jealous and tried to kill David again. So David had learned that Saul was someone whose promises could not be trusted.\n\n### Why did Achish give David the town of Ziklag to live in?\n\nIn [27:5](../27/05.md), David asks King Achish to allow him and his men to live away from the royal city of Gath, in one of the smaller settlements within its territory. Achish agrees and gives David and his men the town of Ziklag. David had told Achish there was no need for him and his men to live with the king. This suggests that for as long as they were in the royal city, they were the king’s guests and lived at his expense. David was courteously offering to do without this support, and Achish accepted his offer. But this also gave David much more freedom of movement, since he was no longer where the officials of Achish could watch him and report on his actions. This allowed him to pretend that he was attacking Israelite settlements when he really was not.

28:intro	abcs				0	# 1 Samuel 28 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the part of the book that describes how David became king ([chapters 16–31](../16/01.md)). It describes how, because of Saul’s disobedience, Yahweh would no longer guide him about how to fight against the Philistines. It tells how Saul instead asked a woman to contact the spirit of Samuel for him so that Samuel could provide guidance. But Samuel only told Saul that what he had prophesied was about to come true. Saul and his sons would be killed in battle against the Philistines the next day.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### What were “ritual pits” and “familiar spirits” ([28:3](../28/03.md))?\n\nA “ritual pit” was a hole that some people in this culture dug in the ground in order to use it in ceremonies in which they tried to contact the spirits of dead people. Some versions of the Bible translate this term as “medium,” referring to a person who tries to contact such spirits. However, the most recent biblical scholarship suggests that the term refers to the pit rather than to the person who uses it. A “familiar spirit” was a supernatural being that people in this culture believed could help them gain secret knowledge. Some versions of the Bible translate this term as “wizard,” “spiritist,” or “soothsayer,” once again referring to the person who uses the means rather than the means itself. But current scholarship suggests in this case as well that it refers to the spirit rather than the person who uses it. The law of Moses forbade such practices, and that was why Saul at first had banned them from Israel. The fact that he now turned to a woman who owned a ritual pit shows how he was no longer obeying God.\n\n### How did the woman know her visitor was Saul once she had seen Samuel?\n\nIn [28:12](../28/12.md), the author says that when the woman with the ritual pit saw Samuel, she “cried out with a loud voice” and then said to her visitor, “Why have you deceived me? For you are Saul!” While the author does not state this explicitly, this suggests that the woman was not expecting to see anyone or anything like Samuel when he appeared. The overall teaching of the Bible is that it is not possible to contact the spirits of people who have died and that it is not possible for those spirits to return to earth. So Yahweh apparently did something very exceptional in this case. This surprised and frightened the woman. She also apparently concluded that this would only have happened for someone as important as Saul, and that was how she realized who her visitor was. Readers of the Bible are not meant to take any encouragement from this episode to try to contact the spirits of people who have died. Samuel announced that Yahweh had judged Saul for his disobedience and that he was was going to punish him with death before another day went by. Trying to contact the spirit of a dead person was further disobedience, and it only resulted in a definitive pronouncement of judgment and punishment.\n\n### Where were Shunem and Gilboa?\n\nThe author says in [28:4](../28/04.md) that Philistines assembled their troops and marched into Israel and set up their tents near the city of Shunem. That city was in the north of Israel, within the Valley of Jezreel. While the Israelites lived in hilly territory that became more mountainous the farther it got from the coast, the Philistines were able to use that valley to march well into Israel. The author also says in [28:4](../28/04.md) that Saul gathered the Israelite army and they set up their tents at Gilboa. That was a mountain range on one side of the Valley of Jezreel. So as in the case of the battle in which Goliath challenged the Israelites ([17:3](../17/03.md)), the Israelites took up defensive positions on a height overlooking a potential field of battle.

29:intro	abct				0	# 1 Samuel 29 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the part of the book that describes how David became king ([chapters 16–31](../16/01.md)). It describes how the Philistine lords refused to have David and his men accompany them into battle against the Israelites.\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetic song in [29:5](../29/05.md).\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Did David want to fight in the Philistine army against the Israelites?\n\nIt is unclear whether David wanted to go into battle with the Philistines against the Israelites. He would have been fighting against Saul, an enemy who was determined to kill him. But he also would have been fighting against the soldiers of his own people group, and they were not his enemies. Some scholars believe that David planned to turn against the Philistines during the battle, as the Philistine lords were afraid he would do. But the author does not say that specifically. As David speaks with Achish in [29:6–10](../29/06.md), he insists that he wants to fight in his army (as he also does in [28:1–2](../28/01.md)). However, David may have said that for his own protection while he was among the Philistines and not really meant it. Since David’s wishes are unclear, we recommend that you not suggest anything about them in the text of your translation or in a footnote.

This is a restatement of where the action left off at [28:4–5](../28/04.md), with the Israelites and Philistines in battle positions facing each other across a valley. Use a word, phrase, or other method here that is natural in your language for reminding readers where a story has left off.

30:intro	abcu				0	# 1 Samuel 30 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the part of the book that describes how David became king ([chapters 16–31](../16/01.md)). It describes how David and his men discovered that the Amalekites had attacked their town of Ziklag while they were away. The Amalekites had captured their families and animals and burned down all the buildings in the town. David received guidance from Yahweh that he would be able to pursue and defeat the Amalekites and recover the family members and animals. Yahweh made it possible for him to do that and also to capture a great amount of further plunder from the Amalekites.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### How did Yahweh guide David to pursue the Amalekites?\n\nWhen David wanted to find out whether he should pursue the Amalekites to try to recover the family members and animals they had captured, he asked Abiathar the priest to bring the ephod to him ([30:7](../30/07.md)). This suggests that David wanted Abiathar to use the Urim and Thummim to answer yes-and-no questions that he would ask Yahweh. The author says that David asked Yahweh, “Shall I pursue after this band? Will I overtake it?” He says that Yahweh replied, “Pursue, for overtaking, you will overtake, and delivering, you will deliver.” But this might be a summary of a series of questions and answers. David may have first asked Yahweh, “Shall I pursue after this band?” Abiathar would then have drawn out whichever stone, the Urim or the Thummim, that they had asked Yahweh to use to indicate “yes.” David would then have asked Yahweh, “Will I overtake it?” The answer once again would have been “yes.” Finally, David would have asked, “Will I deliver the captured people and animals?” And Yahweh would have said “yes.” Represent this in your translation in a way that would be clear and natural in your language.

30:22	w8sk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	אִֽישׁ־רָ֣ע וּ⁠בְלִיַּ֗עַל	1	The terms **evil** and **wicked** mean similar things. The author is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: [the very wicked men]
30:22	fi8u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּאמְר֗וּ	1	The expression **and said** introduces a direct quotation. In your translation, use a natural way of introducing direct quotations in your language. It may not be necessary to represent this expression explicitly.

Alternate translation: [the only thing we will give to them from the plunder that we have rescued is a man, his wife and his sons]
30:22	xabz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	אִ֤ישׁ אֶת־אִשְׁתּ⁠וֹ֙ וְ⁠אֶת־בָּנָ֔י⁠ו	1	The author is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: [that a man may take his wife and his sons]
30:22	a1dr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	וְ⁠אֶת־בָּנָ֔י⁠ו	1	Here the masculine term **sons** has a generic sense that includes both sons and daughters. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use language in your translation that is clearly inclusive of both male and female children. Alternate translation: [and his children]
30:22	esjy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠יִנְהֲג֖וּ	1	Since this refers back to **a man**, it may be more natural in your language to use a singular pronoun here. Alternate translation: [that he may lead away]
30:23	lps0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	אֶחָ֑⁠י	1	Although David is the leader of this group of men, he is not using his authority to insist that they do as he says. Instead, he addresses the men who do not want to share the plunder as his **brothers**. In this context, the term means more than that they are fellow Israelites. David is using it to mean men who have just fought together (“brothers in arms”), as he describes in the next sentence. Your language may have a comparable term that you can use here in your translation.
30:23	ypnb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וַ⁠יִּשְׁמֹ֣ר	1	Here the word **For** introduces not a reason but a further explanation. Alternate translation: [After all he has kept]

30:25	wtd7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עַ֖ד הַ⁠יּ֥וֹם הַ⁠זֶּֽה	1	The author is using this phrase to refer to the time when he was writing. In your translation, make clear that the phrase refers to a time that is now in the past.

30:26	nhdr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּרָכָ֔ה	1	The author is using the term **blessing** to represent a gift. See how you translated this in [25:27](../25/27.md). Alternate translation: [a gift]
30:29	bym0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	הַ⁠יְּרַחְמְאֵלִ֔י & הַ⁠קֵּינִֽי	1	The author is not referring to specific **Jerahmeelite** or **Kenite**. He means Jerahmeelites and Kenites in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using plural forms. Alternate translation: [the Jerahmeelites … the Kenites]
30:31	inbz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	אֲשֶֽׁר־הִתְהַלֶּךְ־שָׁ֥ם דָּוִ֖ד	1	It might seem that this expression contains extra information that would not be natural to express in your language. If so, you can shorten it. Alternate translation: [where David had walked about]
31:intro	abcv				0	# 1 Samuel 31 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the part of the book that describes how David became king ([chapters 16–31](../16/01.md)). The details of how he ultimately became king are told in the book of 2 Samuel. But this chapter is the end of the part of that story that involves Saul. It describes how Saul and his sons were killed in battle with the Philistines.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Why did the men of Jabesh Gilead get Saul’s body from Beth Shan?\n\nAfter the Philistines killed Saul and his sons on Mount Gilboa, the Israelites who lived in that area fled across the Jordan River for safety. The Philistines occupied their cities and towns all the way to Beth Shan, a few miles from the Jordan. They hung the bodies of Saul and his sons on the wall of Beth Shan as a way of celebrating their victory, claiming that territory, and warning the Israelites against any further opposition. However, they were also disgracing and dishonoring Saul’s body by not burying it. The people of Jabesh Gilead were still grateful to Saul for rescuing them years before from the Ammonite king Nahash ([11:1–11](../11/01.md)). To honor him, their soldiers marched all night to Beth Shan and, at great risk to themselves from the Philistines, took down his body and the bodies of his sons and brought them back to Jabesh Gilead for a proper and honorable burial.
31:1	c5le		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וּ⁠פְלִשְׁתִּ֖ים נִלְחָמִ֣ים בְּ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל	1	The author is resuming the story of the Philistine attack against Israel after relating in the previous two chapters the episode of David and his men leaving the Philistine army and rescuing their families and possessions from the Amalekites. The author is resuming the action from where it left off at [29:1](../29/01.md), where the Israelites and Philistines were facing each other in battle positions. Use a word, phrase, or other method here that is natural in your language for resuming a story after relating another episode.
31:1	cfjp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	מִ⁠פְּנֵ֣י פְלִשְׁתִּ֔ים	1	The author is using one part of the Philistines, their **face**, to mean all of them in the act of attacking.

31:1	uq4f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	חֲלָלִ֖ים	1	The author is using the term **pierced** to represent those who died from being pierced by swords or other weapons.

31:2	vdaf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יַּכּ֣וּ פְלִשְׁתִּ֗ים	1	By **struck**, the author means that the Philistine soldiers killed these men. See how you translated the term in [4:2](../04/02.md). Alternate translation: [And the Philistines killed]
31:3	pl9z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠תִּכְבַּ֤ד הַ⁠מִּלְחָמָה֙ אֶל־שָׁא֔וּל	1	The author is speaking of the battle as if it were a **heavy** physical weight pressing down on Saul. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [And the Philistines fought fiercely against Saul]
31:3	s4d2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יִּמְצָאֻ֥⁠הוּ הַ⁠מּוֹרִ֖ים אֲנָשִׁ֣ים בַּ⁠קָּ֑שֶׁת & מֵ⁠הַ⁠מּוֹרִֽים	1	Since the term **shooters** could describe either soldiers throwing javelins or soldiers launching arrows, the author adds the phrase **the men with the bow** to clarify his meaning. Your language may have a single term that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: [And the archers found him … from the archers]
31:3	v4qg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יָּ֥חֶל מְאֹ֖ד מֵ⁠הַ⁠מּוֹרִֽים	1	By this phrase, the author means that Saul was in great pain because the archers had wounded him with arrows. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [And he writhed greatly in pain because the archers had wounded him with arrows]
31:4	l4t3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	שְׁלֹ֥ף חַרְבְּ⁠ךָ֣ ׀ וְ⁠דָקְרֵ֣⁠נִי בָ֗⁠הּ פֶּן־יָ֠בוֹאוּ הָ⁠עֲרֵלִ֨ים הָ⁠אֵ֤לֶּה וּ⁠דְקָרֻ֨⁠נִי֙ וְ⁠הִתְעַלְּלוּ־בִ֔⁠י	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: [So that these uncircumcised ones do not come and stab me and abuse me, draw your sword and stab me with it]
31:4	qloq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וְ⁠דָקְרֵ֣⁠נִי	1	Saul is using the first part of killing someone with a sword, to **stab** that person, to mean the entire act of killing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly as in the UST.
31:4	pvws		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	הָ⁠עֲרֵלִ֨ים הָ⁠אֵ֤לֶּה	1	Saul is using the adjective **uncircumcised** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. See how you translated this in [14:6](../14/06.md). Alternate translation: [these uncircumcised Philistines]

31:4	bbs3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠הִתְעַלְּלוּ־בִ֔⁠י	1	By **abuse**, Saul means that the Philistines would taunt and torture him. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [and taunt and torture me]
31:4	zqvz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	וְ⁠לֹ֤א אָבָה֙ נֹשֵׂ֣א כֵלָ֔י⁠ו כִּ֥י יָרֵ֖א מְאֹ֑ד	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: [But since the carrier of his equipment feared greatly, he was not willing]
31:4	lk8m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֶת־הַ⁠חֶ֔רֶב	1	By **the sword**, the author means Saul’s own sword. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation, as in the UST, if that would be helpful to your readers.
31:6	tv97		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	גַּ֧ם כָּל־אֲנָשָׁ֛י⁠ו	1	By **all of his men**, the author means the rest of Saul’s bodyguard, not his entire army. (The later narrative makes clear that many of them, including his general Abner, survived.) You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [and the rest of his bodyguard]
31:7	c8ye		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֲשֶׁר־בְּ⁠עֵ֨בֶר הָ⁠עֵ֜מֶק וַ⁠אֲשֶׁ֣ר ׀ בְּ⁠עֵ֣בֶר הַ⁠יַּרְדֵּ֗ן	1	By these phrases, the author means the Israelites who lived in the territory north of the Valley of Jezreel and west of the Jordan River.

31:8	b71b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַֽ⁠יְהִי֙	1	The author is introducing a new development in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method here that is natural in your language for introducing a new development.
31:8	kqyt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	אֶת־הַ⁠חֲלָלִ֑ים	1	The author is using the adjective **pierced** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: [those whom they had pierced]
31:8	q61m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֶת־הַ⁠חֲלָלִ֑ים	1	The author is using the term **pierced** to represent those who died from being pierced. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [the dead]
31:8	ibgg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	נֹפְלִ֖ים	1	The author is using the term **fallen** to represent those who had died in battle, since soldiers fall down when they die.

31:9	i7sj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בֵּ֥ית עֲצַבֵּי⁠הֶ֖ם	1	The author is speaking of the temple in which the Philistines worshiped their idols as if it were a **house** in which that idol lived. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. (Since the narrative has already shown that the Philistines had multiple idol temples, you may wish to use a plural form.) Alternate translation: [to the temples of their idols]
31:10	pwyh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יָּשִׂ֨מוּ֙ אֶת־כֵּלָ֔י⁠ו בֵּ֖ית עַשְׁתָּר֑וֹת	1	By this phrase, the author means that they put both Saul’s equipment and his head in their temple. The parallel account in [1 Chronicles 10:10](../../1ch/10/10.md) states that explicitly. You could indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [And they put his equipment and his head in the house of the Ashtoreths]

This is what David did with Goliath’s sword and head, as the author describes in [17:54](../17/54.md). See how you described the similar action there. Alternate translation: [And they put his equipment and head in the house of the Ashtoreths as trophies of war]
31:10	u8mn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וְ⁠אֶת־גְּוִיָּת⁠וֹ֙ תָּקְע֔וּ בְּ⁠חוֹמַ֖ת בֵּ֥ית שָֽׁן	1	The city of **Beth Shan** was a few miles west of the Jordan River. The narrative suggests in [31:7](../31/07.md) that the Philistines had occupied this city. By hanging on the city wall the body of the Israelite king they had killed, they were asserting that they had conquered Israelite territory extending this far. (This act was probably also intended to terrify the surrounding Israelite population into non-resistance.) If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: [and they fastened his corpse on the wall of Beth Shan to assert that they had conquered the territory extending that far]
31:10	voda		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	גְּוִיָּת⁠וֹ֙	1	The author is using the body of one person that the Philistines fastened to the wall, Saul’s **corpse**, to represent the bodies of Saul and his sons.

31:12	v6jc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יָּק֜וּמוּ כָּל־אִ֣ישׁ חַיִל֮	1	By this phrase, the author means that these men took action. See how you translated the term **arose** in [1:9](../01/09.md). Alternate translation: [And all of the men of valor took action]
31:12	llza		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	אִ֣ישׁ חַיִל֮	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **valor**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [the valiant men]
31:12	nx4u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יִּשְׂרְפ֥וּ אֹתָ֖⁠ם שָֽׁם	1	The Israelites probably **burned** the bodies in this instance, even though that was not their usual practice, in order to prevent any further desecration of them by the Philistines. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [and they burned them there to prevent the Philistines from desecrating them any further]
31:13	p6ku		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	תַֽחַת־הָ⁠אֶ֖שֶׁל	1	Sitting under a **tamarisk tree** was symbolic of royal status, as the story indicates in [22:6](../22/06.md). By burying Saul under that kind of tree, the people of Jabesh Gilead were giving him royal honors in his death. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: [under the tamarisk tree in Jabesh to honor Saul’s royal status]
31:13	r8j9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וַ⁠יָּצֻ֖מוּ שִׁבְעַ֥ת יָמִֽים	1	The people of Jabesh Gilead **fasted seven days** to show respect to Saul and to express their grief over his death. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: [And they fasted seven days as a sign of mourning and respect]
