He first ruled over the tribe of Judah for seven and a half years. Then the other 11 tribes agreed to have him become their king. He ruled over all Israel for 33 years.\n\nThroughout most of this time, David led his army to fight foreign enemies who attacked Israel. However, he struggled the most against someone in his own family. Absalom, his son, rebelled and fought against him.\n\nThe book of 2 Samuel also tells about when David sinned greatly. He made Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah the Hittite, have sexual relations with him. When she became pregnant, David arranged for Uriah to be killed in battle. David and all Israel suffered much because of David’s sin. However, the writer also tells how Yahweh repeatedly showed David mercy after David repented of his sin.\n\n### What is the purpose of the book of 2 Samuel?\n\nThe book of 2 Samuel continues to tell the story of the Israelites once they had kings. It is part of a long history that also includes the preceding book of 1 Samuel and the following books of 1 Kings and 2 Kings. The entire history shows that Yahweh was not at fault for the Israelites being conquered and exiled from their land. Instead, this happened because the people disobeyed Yahweh and broke their covenant with him.\n\n### Who wrote the book of 2 Samuel?\n\nThe author or authors who wrote 2 Samuel do not identify themselves by name in the book. However, many interpreters believe that the prophets in Israel recorded the events in this book, as well as in the entire history of which it is a part, in order to demonstrate that the people had disobeyed Yahweh and to encourage them to obey Yahweh once more so that they could be restored to their land.\n\n### What title should translators use for this book?\n\nTranslators can use the traditional title 2 Samuel or Second Samuel. Translators may also consider a different title such as “The Book about King David’s Reign.”\n\n### Can I translate this book before 1 Samuel?\n\nThe book of 1 Samuel should be translated before 2 Samuel, since 2 Samuel continues from where 1 Samuel ends.\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What covenant had its beginning in the book of 2 Samuel?\n\nIn [2 Samuel 7](../07/01.md), Yahweh made a covenant with David. God promised to make a descendant of David rule forever over Israel. Christians believe that Jesus Christ fulfills this covenant. Jesus was a descendant of David. Jesus is the true “anointed one,” the person God chose to be king forever. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenant]])\n\n## Part 3: Translation Issues in This Book\n\n### “And it happened”\n\nThe author often uses the phrase “And it happened” to introduce a new event in the story or a new development within an episode. To translate this phrase in its various occurrences, use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event or development. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])\n\n### “behold”\n\nThe author and characters often use the word “behold” to focus their listeners’ attention on what they are about to say. While the word literally means “look,” the speakers do not want their listeners to look at something, but to pay careful attention. For example, the author says “behold, a man came from the camp” in [1:2](../01/02.md) in order to call the readers’ attention to this new development in the story. Characters may use the equivalent expression “look,” which similarly means “pay attention.” For example, David says “Look” to Nathan in [7:2](../07/02.md) to mean “Listen.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### “to this day”\n\nIn [2 Samuel 4:3](../04/03.md), [6:8](../06/08.md), and [7:6](../07/06.md), and [18:18](../18/18.md), the author uses the phrase “to this day.” By that phrase, he is referring to the time at which he was writing. The translator should be aware that “to this day” refers to a time that is now in the past. He must avoid giving the impression that “to this day” means the present day of the translation’s readers. The translator might decide to say “at the time when this is being written” or “at the time of this writing.”\n\n### “in the eyes of”\n\nThe author and characters often speak of something being good or bad “in the eyes of” someone. This means that that person considered this to be a good or bad thing to do. For example, the author says in [3:18](../03/18.md) that Abner went to speak to David about “all that {had been} good in the eyes of Israel and in the eyes of all of the house of Benjamin.” He means that Abner went to tell David that all of the Israelite tribes, including Benjamin (Saul’s tribe) considered it right to make David the next king. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])\n\n### “to the face of”\n\nThe expression “to the face of” can have different shades of meaning, depending on the context.\n  * The author and characters often use the word “face” to represent the presence of a person or group, by association with the way people can see the face of someone who is present. For example, David tells Abner in [3:13](../03/13.md), “You will not see my face unless you bring Michal,” meaning, “You will not come into my presence unless you bring Michal.”\n  * The focus may also be on something being in front of or before a person or thing, either in space or in time. For example, David says in [3:35](../03/35.md) that he will not eat “to the face of the going of the sun.” He means that he will not eat before a certain time, sundown.\n  * Sometimes the idea of “in front of” has a further association. For example, the author says in [10:16](../10/16.md) that when the Arameans gathered a large army, “Shobach, the commander of the army of Hadadezer, was to their faces.” By saying that Shobach was in front of these troops, he means that Shobach was commanding them.\n  * The focus may also be on the relationship or interaction between people or groups, as in [2:17](../02/17.md), where the author says that “Abner and the men of Israel were struck to the face of the servants of David.” He means that they were defeated in front of David’s soldiers, that is, they were defeated as they opposed David’s soldiers. In other words, David’s soldiers defeated them in battle. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])\n\nIn other contexts, the author or a character may use the word “face,” describing part of a person, in order to represent the whole person. For example, in [1 Samuel 21:10](../../1sa/21/10.md), the author says that David fled “from the face of Saul.” He is using one part of Saul, his “face,” to mean all of him in his determination to kill David. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])\n\n### “into the hand of”/“into your hand”\n\nThe author and characters often use the word “hand” by association to represent power, capability, or control. For example, when Abner tells Ishbosheth in [3:8](../03/08.md), “I have not delivered you into the hand of David,” he means that he has not allowed David to overpower Ishbosheth and replace him as king.\n\nThe word “hand” may also represent possession or conveyance, as when the author says in [8:10](../08/10.md) that a king sent an ambassador to David and “in his hand were vessels of silver and vessels of gold and vessels of bronze.” The word “hand” may also represent agency, as when Abner remarks in [3:18](../03/18.md) that Yahweh had said, “By the hand of David my servant, I will save my people Israel.” Translation notes will help distinguish the difference between these shades of meaning when that may not be clear from the context. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])\n\nIn other contexts, the author or a character may use the word “hand,” describing part of a person, in order to represent the whole person. For example, in [2 Samuel 12:25](../12/25.md), the author says that Yahweh “sent by the hand of Nathan the prophet.” He is using one part of Nathan, his “hand,” to mean all of him in the act of bringing a message from Yahweh, as if he were carrying that message in his hand. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])\n\n### “listen”\n\nThe author and characters often use the terms “listen” or “hear” to mean complying with what someone has said. For example, David’s servants say in [12:18](../12/18.md), “he did not listen to our voice,” meaning that David was not willing to do what they were urging him to do. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])\n\n### name of a person representing him and associated or accompanying people\n\nThe author and characters often use the name of a person to represent that person and others who are associated with or accompanying that person. For example, in [1:1](../01/01.md), when the author says that “David returned from striking the Amalekites,” he is using David, one person who was involved in this action, to represent everyone who accompanied him. The text makes clear that David’s men returned with him. So the author means that David and his men returned together to Ziklag. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])\n\n### name of nation, tribe, or city representing its people\n\nThe author and characters often use the name of a nation, tribe, or city by association to represent its people or its army. For example, in [2:28](../02/28.md), when the author says that Joab’s soldiers “did not still pursue after Israel,” he is using the name of the nation of Israel to refer by association to soldiers from the tribes of Israel other than Judah. When a nation has the same name as its ancestor, this is the same thing as using the name of the ancestor by association to mean his descendants. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])\n\n### “saying”\n\nThe author frequently uses the term “saying” to introduce a direct quotation. In your translation, use a natural way of introducing direct quotations in your language. It may not be necessary to represent this term explicitly. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])\n\n### “sons of”\n\nThe author and characters often speak of “the sons of” a person to mean the nation or tribe that consists of his descendants. For example, in [7:6](../07/06.md) Yahweh speaks of the “sons of Israel” to mean the Israelites. In [12:12](../12/12.md), Samuel speaks of the “sons of Ammon” to mean the Ammonites. In this case, “sons” does not mean first-generation offspring but later descendants. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### “strike/struck”\n\nIn many places, the author says that soldiers “struck” an opposing army, city, or king as if they had only hit them. But in various contexts, he means that they either attacked, defeated, or killed those opponents. For example, when the author says in [8:1](../08/01.md) that “David struck the Philistines, and he subdued them,” he means that David attacked them in order to keep them from being a continual threat to Israel. When he says in [2:17](../02/17.md) that “Abner and the men of Israel were struck to the face of the servants of David,” he means that David’s soldiers defeated Abner and the Israelite soldiers. And when he says in [2:31](../02/31.md) that “the servants of David had struck from Benjamin and among the men of Abner 360 men,” he means that they had killed those men. Consider carefully how to translate the term “struck” in each context where it does not actually mean “hit.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])\n\n### travel descriptions marked for change in elevation (“went up,” “went down”)\n\nIn Hebrew, writers and speakers generally indicated whether people were going up to a higher elevation or going down to a lower elevation when they traveled. For example, in [2:1](../02/01.md) David asks Yahweh, “Shall I go up into one of the cities of Judah?” David says “go up” because he is in Ziklag, near the seacoast, so he would be going up in elevation if he went to a city in the hilly territory of Judah. If your language does not mark travel for change in elevation, you can translate instances such as these simply as “went” or “go.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])
1:intro	la44				0	# 2 Samuel 1 Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the story from the last section of 1 Samuel about how David became king of Israel. It tells how he learned that Saul and Jonathan had died and how he composed a song to celebrate their lives and grieve their deaths.\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetic song in [1:19–27](../01/19.md).\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Why is the young Amalekite’s account of Saul’s death different from the account in [1 Samuel 31](../../1sa/31/01.md)?\n\nIn [1 Samuel 31:4](../../1sa/31/04.md), the author says that Saul died by falling on his own sword after Philistine archers wounded him badly. In this chapter, a young Amalekite man says that he killed Saul himself when Philistine chariots and horsemen, not archers, were threatening him. The reason for the difference in the accounts is that the young man is probably lying. \nHe is not an Israelite but an Amalekite living in Israel, as he says in [1:13](../01/13.md). He may have been working for a soldier or group of soldiers in the Israelite military camp on Mount Gilboa, or he may have been someone who followed the army at a distance, hoping to get plunder after a battle. Either way, he would not have gone into the battle with the Israelite army. He probably hid as Philistines pursued the fleeing Israelites onto Mount Gilboa, and once the battle had moved on from there, he went out to take whatever valuables he could find from the bodies of dead soldiers. (The Philistines did not return to do that themselves until the next day, according to [1 Samuel 31:8](../../1sa/31/08.md).) \nHe recognized Saul’s body from his royal crown and armband, and he took those things for himself. He believed that David considered Saul to be his enemy and that David would reward him if he had killed Saul. (David suggests in [2 Samuel 4:10](../04/10.md) that this was the young man’s motive.) So rather than keeping the golden crown and armband for their value, he brought them to David as supposed proof that he had killed Saul. But his story is improbable. He certainly would not have been in the thick of the battle, as he claims. Moreover, Saul would not have been standing alone on the battlefield, leaning on his spear. The author says in [1 Samuel 31:6](../../1sa/31/06.md) that Saul’s entire bodyguard died with him, reflecting the way that Israelite soldiers would have surrounded and defended Saul to the last man. If the Philistines had already killed his entire bodyguard, they would have killed Saul too. So the Amalekite has made up a story in the hopes that David will think he has killed Saul and reward him. As the story describes, however, this false claim only got the Amalekite himself killed. David had no way of knowing that his story was not true, and he had him executed for killing “the anointed one of Yahweh” ([1:14](../01/14.md)).\n\n### Why was Saul’s shield still on Mount Gilboa?\n\n1 Samuel [31:10](../31/10.md) says that when the Philistines found Saul dead on Mount Gilboa the day after their battle with the Israelites, they took Saul’s equipment and put it in one of their idol temples as a trophy of victory. But David speaks in [2 Samuel 1:21](../01/21.md) as if Saul’s shield was still on Mount Gilboa. It is possible that the Philistines simply did not consider the shield something they should put in their temple along with Saul’s armor and weapons. \nHowever, David uses a strong word for how the shield was treated. He does not say that it was simply disregarded. He says that it was “loathed.” Elsewhere in the Bible, this word describes people deliberately rejecting something or someone else with a feeling of strong antipathy. So it is possible that the Philistines intentionally left Saul’s shield behind as an insult to him. This would have been a symbolic action suggesting that the shield was worthless, since it had not protected Saul from their weapons. This would be a way of asserting their military superiority over the Israelites. You may have a term in your language that you can use to translate “loathed” that would convey this meaning.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Parallelism\n\nIn the song that David composed as a memorial tribute to Saul and Jonathan ([1:19–27](../01/19.md)), in many cases, a phrase means basically the same thing as the phrase before it. The second phrase emphasizes the meaning of the first phrase by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, it may be clearer in your language to connect the phrases with a word that shows that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. For example, in [1:20](../01/20.md), for “lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice, lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph,” you might say, “otherwise, the daughters of the Philistines would rejoice, yes, the daughters of the uncircumcised would triumph.” In [1:22](../01/22.md), for “the bow of Jonathan did not turn back, and the sword of Saul did not return empty,” you might say, “the bow of Jonathan did not turn back, no, the sword of Saul did not return empty.”\n\n### David’s love for Jonathan\n\nDavid speaks in [1:26](../01/26.md) of the love that he and Jonathan had for each other. If your language has more than one term for “love,” be sure not to use a term that describes sexual desire. Biblical Hebrew has specific language for sexual desire, and David does not use that language here. David speaks of Jonathan as his “brother,” meaning that he is his dear friend. When David says that this love “was more wonderful to me than the love of women,” he means that a deep, abiding friendship is better than romance. If your language has a word for friendship-love, it would be appropriate to use that word here in your translation. You could also use a word for unselfish love. If you have already translated the book of 1 Samuel, see how you translated the similar expression in [1 Samuel 18:1](../../1sa/18/01.md).
1:1	uw43		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֗י	1	See the discussion of this phrase in the Introduction to 2 Samuel. The author is using it to introduce a new development in the story.

1:1	htrj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	יָמִ֥ים שְׁנָֽיִם	1	The author is expressing this in the way his culture reckoned time. He does not mean that David and his men arrived in Ziklag and stayed there for two subsequent days before something further happened. He is reckoning the day of their arrival as the first of these **two days**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [that day and the next one]

He knelt down in front of David as a gesture to honor him. He then **prostrated himself** or stretched out flat on the ground to show David great honor. Alternate translation: [and he knelt on the ground in front of David, stretching himself out flat, to honor him greatly]
1:3	dgmo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אֵ֥י מִ⁠זֶּ֖ה תָּב֑וֹא	1	David is using a common expression of his culture.

If so, you could leave it out. Alternate translation: [And the young man said]
1:6	k7ul		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	נִקְרֹ֤א נִקְרֵ֨יתִי֙	1	The young man is repeating forms of the same verb in order to intensify his expression of the idea that it conveys. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the intensification. Alternate translation: [I just happened to be]

Alternate translation: [Since my life is still whole in me, agony has seized me, so please stand over me and kill me]
1:9	fwrn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	אֲחָזַ֖⁠נִי הַ⁠שָּׁבָ֑ץ	1	The young man claims that Saul spoke of **agony** as if it were a living thing that could have **seized** him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. This could mean: (1) that Saul is in such pain from his wounds that he is no longer capable of fighting. The **agony** would be restraining him in that sense, as if it had **seized** him and was holding him immobile. Alternate translation: [I am in too much pain to defend myself]; (2) that Saul has an overwhelming sense of pain. Alternate translation: [I am in very great agony]
1:9	sujk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	עֲמָד & עָלַ⁠י֙ וּ⁠מֹ֣תְתֵ֔⁠נִי	1	This could mean: (1) that Saul is using a common expression of his culture to mean that he wants this young man to use violence against him. In this context, the expression **stand over me** may be equivalent to the expression “rise up against” in [22:49](../22/49.md). Alternate translation: [attack me and kill me]; (2) that Saul actually wants the young man to **stand over** him and use all of his weight to push a sword or spear into him and kill him. Alternate translation: [stab me with all your weight and kill me]
1:9	qxcc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כָל־ע֥וֹד נַפְשִׁ֖⁠י בִּֽ⁠י	1	By **my life {is} still whole in me**, Saul means that he is badly wounded, but not mortally wounded. He will not die imminently from the wounds he currently has. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [I am badly wounded, but not wounded mortally]

Alternate translation: [So because I knew that he would not live after his having fallen, I stood over him and killed him]
1:10	ezin		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וָ⁠אֶעֱמֹ֤ד עָלָי⁠ו֙ וַ⁠אֲמֹ֣תְתֵ֔⁠הוּ	1	The young man is using a common expression of his culture, **I stood over him**, to mean that he attacked Saul. See how you translated the similar expression in the previous verse. Alternate translation: [So I attacked him and killed him] or [So I stabbed him with all my weight and killed him]
1:10	yrz8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לֹ֥א יִֽחְיֶ֖ה אַחֲרֵ֣י נִפְל֑⁠וֹ	1	The young man does not mean that Saul had actually **fallen** to the ground. He says in [1:6](../01/06.md) that Saul was standing up, leaning on his spear. The young man is speaking of Saul being badly defeated by the Philistines as if Saul had fallen from a height. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [the Philistines would surely kill him now that they had defeated his entire army]
1:10	kd7k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	הַ⁠נֵּ֣זֶר ׀ אֲשֶׁ֣ר עַל־רֹאשׁ֗⁠וֹ וְ⁠אֶצְעָדָה֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר עַל־זְרֹע֔⁠וֹ	1	A **crown** is a decorative headpiece that shows that a person is a king. In this context, the term describes a narrow band of gold encircling Saul’s helmet, not a large, ornamental headpiece with jewels. The **band on his arm** was probably a decorative item worn on the arm to show that the person was a king. If your readers would not be familiar with what these items are, in your translation you could use the name of similar things that your readers would recognize, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: [the royal headpiece that was on his head and the royal armband that was on his arm]
1:10	ipwm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	אֶל־אֲדֹנִ֖⁠י	1	Even though the young man is addressing David directly, he is speaking of him in the third person as **my master** to show respect. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in a respectful form in the second person. Alternate translation: [to you, my master]
1:11	jv1v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וַ⁠יַּחֲזֵ֥ק דָּוִ֛ד בִּבְגָדָ֖יו וַ⁠יִּקְרָעֵ֑⁠ם	1	This was a symbolic action that showed David was feeling shock and grief.

Alternate translation: [And because Saul and Jonathan his son and the people of Yahweh had fallen by the sword, they mourned and wept and fasted until the evening for them and for the house of Israel]
1:12	d1z7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עַ֤ם יְהוָה֙	1	By **the people of Yahweh**, the author means the Israelite army. See how you translated the term “people” in [1:4](../01/04.md). Alternate translation: [the army of Yahweh] or [the Israelite army]
1:12	bbrl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בֵּ֣ית יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל	1	Here, **house** means all the people descended from a particular person. It envisions them as if they were one household living together. So **the house of Israel** figuratively means all the people descended from the man named Israel (who was also known as Jacob). If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [the nation of Israel]
1:12	nyek		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	נָפְל֖וּ	1	The author is using the term **fallen** by association to mean that they had died, since soldiers fall down when they die. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [they had died]
1:12	mppa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בֶּ⁠חָֽרֶב	1	The author is using the term **sword** by association to mean battle, since swords were used in battle. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [in battle]
1:13	sw9o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אֵ֥י מִ⁠זֶּ֖ה אָ֑תָּה	1	David is using a common expression of his culture. See how you translated the similar expression in [1:3](../01/03.md). Alternate translation: [Where are you from]
1:13	zdee		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	אִ֛ישׁ גֵּ֥ר	1	The man is using this expression to introduce his father as a participant in his story. Your language may have its own way of introducing participants that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: [a certain foreigner]

If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [You should have feared to stretch out your hand to destroy the anointed of Yahweh!]
1:14	d5kl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לִ⁠שְׁלֹ֨חַ֙ יָֽדְ⁠ךָ֔ לְ⁠שַׁחֵ֖ת	1	David is using a common expression of his culture, **stretch out your hand**, to mean attacking or violently harming someone. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [to use violence to destroy]
1:14	ny5h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	אֶת־מְשִׁ֥יחַ יְהוָֽה	1	David is using the adjective **anointed** as a noun to mean a particular of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this adjective with an equivalent phrase, here and in [verse 16](../01/16.md). Alternate translation: [the anointed one of Yahweh] or [the one whom Yahweh anointed]
1:15	sjki		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	פְּגַע & וַ⁠יַּכֵּ֖⁠הוּ	1	See how you translated the term “striking” in [1:1](../01/01.md) in light of the discussion in the Introduction to 2 Samuel. Alternate translation: [attack … And he attacked him]
1:15	arll		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֖אמֶר	1	The phrase **and he said** introduces a direct quotation. In your translation, use a natural way of introducing direct quotations in your language. It may not be necessary to represent this phrase explicitly.

He would actually be speaking to the people who can hear him, the men around him. If this would not be clear to your readers, you could translate David’s words as if he were speaking directly to those who can hear him. Alternate translation: [And David said, “His blood is on his own head, for his mouth answered against him, saying, ‘I myself killed the anointed of Yahweh]; (2) that the young man had not died yet and David was speaking to him directly. (The author’s statement in the previous verse, “and he died,” would be a description of what ultimately happened.) Alternate translation: [And David said to him as he was dying, “Your blood {is} on your head, for your mouth answered against you, saying, ‘I myself killed the anointed of Yahweh]
1:16	a3f9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	דָּמְךָ֖ עַל־רֹאשֶׁ֑⁠ךָ כִּ֣י פִ֗י⁠ךָ עָנָ֤ה בְ⁠ךָ֙ לֵ⁠אמֹ֔ר אָנֹכִ֥י מֹתַ֖תִּי אֶת־מְשִׁ֥יחַ יְהוָֽה	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: [Since your mouth answered against you, saying, ‘I myself killed the anointed of Yahweh,’ your blood is on your head]
1:16	gyo2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	דָּמְךָ֖ עַל־רֹאשֶׁ֑⁠ךָ	1	David is using the term **blood** by association to mean “death,” since the young man he summoned shed the Amalekite’s blood when he killed him.

1:16	jfy8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	דָּמְךָ֖ עַל־רֹאשֶׁ֑⁠ךָ	1	When David says **on your head**, he is using a common expression that means that someone is morally and legally responsible for something.

1:16	h3it		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	פִ֗י⁠ךָ עָנָ֤ה בְ⁠ךָ֙	1	David is speaking of the young man’s **mouth** as if it were a living thing that could testify against him.

1:16	y37z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	לֵ⁠אמֹ֔ר	1	The term **saying** introduces a direct quotation. In your translation, use a natural way of introducing direct quotations in your language. It may not be necessary to represent this term explicitly, here and throughout your translation.
1:17	g54c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	וַ⁠יְקֹנֵ֣ן דָּוִ֔ד אֶת־הַ⁠קִּינָ֖ה הַ⁠זֹּ֑את	1	It might seem that this expression contains extra information that would not be natural to express in your language.

1:18	zrz8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בְּנֵֽי־יְהוּדָ֖ה	1	See the discussion of the phrase **sons of** in the Introduction to 2 Samuel. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [the people of Judah]

He is doing this to show in a strong way how he feels about the deaths of Saul and Jonathan. He is actually speaking to the people who can hear him, the people of Judah who will eventually learn this song. If this would not be clear to your readers, you could translate David’s words as if he were speaking directly to those who could hear him. Alternate translation: [The splendor of Israel {is} slain on its high places]
1:19	hhxt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	הַ⁠צְּבִי֙ יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל & חָלָ֑ל	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **splendor**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [The men who made Israel splendid lie slain]
1:19	pho2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	הַ⁠צְּבִי֙ יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל	1	David is speaking about **Israel** in the third person even though he is addressing that nation directly.

1:19	n2h4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֵ֖יךְ נָפְל֥וּ גִבּוֹרִֽים	1	David is using the term **fallen** by association to mean “died,” since these soldiers fell down when they died. See how you translated this word in [1:12](../01/12.md). Alternate translation: [How the mighty have died]
1:19	ewus		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	אֵ֖יךְ נָפְל֥וּ גִבּוֹרִֽים	1	David is using the adjective **mighty** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this adjective with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: [How these mighty warriors have died]
1:19	lh22		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	אֵ֖יךְ נָפְל֥וּ גִבּוֹרִֽים	1	David is using a phrase that expresses a strong feeling, great sorrow that the mighty warriors have died.

Use a comparable expression that would be natural in your language. Alternate translation: [May no one declare it in Gath, may no one proclaim it in the streets of Ashkelon] or [May it not be declared in Gath, may it not be proclaimed in the streets of Ashkelon]

See the discussion of this practice in the Introduction to this chapter to help you decide how you will represent such pairs of phrases in your translation.
1:20	z682		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בְּנ֣וֹת פְּלִשְׁתִּ֔ים	1	Here the term **daughters** has the same kind of meaning as the term **sons** in [1:18](../01/18.md). See how you decided to translate that term there. Alternate translation: [the women of Philistia]
1:20	fdn0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	בְּנ֥וֹת הָ⁠עֲרֵלִֽים	1	David is using the adjective **uncircumcised** as a noun to mean people who have not been circumcised. Israelites used this as a term of derision to describe the Philistines as people did not worship Yahweh and did no obey his laws, such as the one requiring the circumcision of men. Your language may have a comparable term of derision that you can use in your translation. If you have already translated the book of 1 Samuel, see how you translated this term in [1 Samuel 14:6](../../1sa/14/06.md). Alternate translation: [the women among those heathen]

If this would not be clear to your readers, you could translate his words as if he were speaking directly to people who could hear him.

1:21	wis1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	וּ⁠שְׂדֵ֣י תְרוּמֹ֑ת	1	David is using this possessive form to mean fields that produce only enough crops for people to use as offerings. Offerings were typically only a small percentage of an overall crop. So David is wishing for so little rain and dew that the fields will not produce even a fraction of their usual amount. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: [nor fields producing even enough crops for small offerings]

David is speaking similarly of **the sword of Saul** as if it had been a person who could have been sent to get something but who might have returned with **empty** hands, that is, without it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [When Jonathan shot arrows at enemy soldiers, the arrows pierced them so that they bled and died. When Saul stabbed enemy soldiers, his sword cut them so deeply that their fat came out and they died]

Alternate translation: [The daughters of Israel should weep for Saul, the one having clothed them in scarlet with delights, the one having put an ornament of gold on their clothing]

David is illustrating the prosperity that Saul brought to Israel by ensuring its security and by plundering its enemies. The UST models one way to express this meaning.
1:24	edwh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	שָׁנִי֙	1	David is using the term **scarlet** by association to mean clothing that was scarlet in color. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [in scarlet-colored clothing]
1:24	pmmg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	שָׁנִי֙ עִם־עֲדָנִ֔ים	1	This expression conveys a single idea by using two phrases connected with **with**. The phrase **in delights** tells in what way Saul clothed the women **in scarlet**. Specifically, the clothing brought delight to the ones who wore it. Alternate translation: [delightfully in scarlet]
1:24	v3cy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	שָׁנִי֙	1	The term **scarlet** refers to a bright red color. In this culture, people had to use an expensive dye to make clothes this color. So having scarlet clothing represented prosperity and status. If your readers would not be familiar with what scarlet is, in your translation you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: [in expensive clothing]

1:26	d4lg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לִ֣⁠י עָלֶ֗י⁠ךָ	1	David is speaking as if he were in a **narrow** (tightly confined) space in which he did not have much freedom of movement. In such a situation, a person would feel distress, and that feeling is what David is expressing through this image. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [I am very distressed about you]
1:26	z1gj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אָחִ⁠י֙ יְה֣וֹנָתָ֔ן	1	David is speaking as if Jonathan were his actual brother, even though he was not.

Alternate translation: [my dear friend Jonathan]

1:27	z78o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יֹּאבְד֖וּ כְּלֵ֥י מִלְחָמָֽה	1	David is using these **weapons** by association to mean Saul and Jonathan who used them so skillfully, as he describes in [1:22](../01/22.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [and how these men who used weapons of war so skillfully have perished]
1:27	s0p9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	וַ⁠יֹּאבְד֖וּ כְּלֵ֥י מִלְחָמָֽה	1	David is using a phrase that expresses a strong feeling, great sorrow that Saul and Jonathan, who used weapons skillfully, have died. There may be an equivalent word or phrase in your language that you can use in your translation to convey this feeling. If not, you could indicate specifically what David was feeling.

2:intro	k322				0	# 2 Samuel 2 Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the story of how David became king of Israel. It tells how he returned to live in the city of Hebron in the territory of the tribe of Judah. There the leaders of that tribe anointed him to be the king of Judah. This chapter also tells how Abner, who had been Saul’s commander, installed Saul’s son Ishbosheth as a rival king in the city of Mahanaim on the other side of the Jordan River. It tells how Abner reconquered the territory that the Israelites had lost to the Philistines and then led a group of soldiers to challenge David’s rule. But soldiers loyal to David, under the command of his nephew Joab, defeated Abner’s soldiers and drove them away.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### For which “two years” did Ishbosheth reign?\n\nThe author says in [2:10](../02/10.md) that Ishbosheth reigned for two years after the death of his father Saul. He says in [2:11](../02/11.md) that David “was king in Hebron over the house of Judah” for seven years and six months, also starting shortly after the death of Saul. However, it appears from [5:1](../05/01.md) that the other tribes of Israel came and anointed David as their king shortly after the death of Ishbosheth. So what accounts for the difference of five and a half years? The explanation may be in what the author says in [2:9](../02/09.md), that Abner, by steadily reconquering territory from the Philistines, made Ishbosheth “rule over Gilead and over the Ashurite and over Jezreel and over Ephraim and over Benjamin and over Israel, all of it.” The statement that Ishbosheth was 40 years old “when he became king over Israel, and he reigned two years” would be dating the beginning of his reign from the time when Abner had reconquered all of Israel’s territory from the Philistines. So the other five and a half years represent the time it took for Abner to complete this reconquest.\n\n### Why did Joab’s soldiers stop when they got to Asahel’s body?\n\nIn [2:23](../02/23.md), the author says that after Abner killed Asahel, when any of Joab’s soldiers came to the place where Asahel’s body was lying, they stopped pursuing Abner’s soldiers and just stood there. There are several reasons why they may have done this. One possibility is that they wanted to protect Asahel’s body from being mistreated (as Saul said in [1 Samuel 31:4](../../1sa/31/04.md) that he was concerned might happen to his body). Another possibility is that they stopped as an act of mourning, as an expression of grief and respect for Asahel. A further possibility is that seeing that Asahel had died in this way upset them so much that they were not able to continue pursuing Abner’s soldiers. However, as the author does not say specifically why the soldiers stopped, we recommend that you do not indicate anything about this in the text of your translation.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### A standard way of describing a king’s reign\n\nThe statement in [2:10](../02/10.md), “Ishbosheth, the son of Saul, was a son of 40 years when he became king over Israel, and he reigned two years,” is the first instance in this book of a standard description that occurs repeatedly in this history of Israel that extends through 1–2 Samuel and 1–2 Kings. At the start of the account of each king’s reign, the history tells how old that man was when he became king and for how long he reigned. In your translation, be sure to translate this description consistently throughout these books so that your readers will recognize how the history is using it. If you have already translated the book of 1 Samuel, see how you translated the similar description in [1 Samuel 13:1](../../1sa/13/01.md).\n\n### The meaning of “play” in [2:14](../02/14.md)\n\nIn [2:14](../02/14.md), Abner says to Joab, “May the young men now arise and play to our faces.” Abner could be suggesting to Joab that some of their soldiers engage in single combat in order to determine the victor of the conflict between them. Abner may have felt that it would be wise for both sides not to suffer many casualties fighting each other with full armies when they were still threatened by the Philistines. The term “play” would denote the war-play of single combat. Another possibility is that Abner wants a battle to decide whether David or Ishbosheth would rule over Judah, but he recognizes how both armies have cautiously taken up defensive positions. So he is suggesting an initial skirmish that he is confident will lead to a full battle. The word “play” would describe the fighting as a spectacle that would incite the soldiers of each army to attack their opponents, in much the same way that joining together in a war cry would arouse soldiers to fight. A note to [2:14](../02/14.md) suggests ways of representing each of these possible meanings.

2:1	ewxp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	הַ⁠אֶעֱלֶ֗ה	1	See the discussion in the Introduction to 2 Samuel of how Hebrew speakers and writers marked descriptions of travel for change in elevation. David says **go up** because he is in Ziklag, near the seacoast, so he would be going up in elevation if he went to a city in the territory of Judah, which was hilly. Alternate translation: [Shall I go]
2:1	r7xb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	הַ⁠אֶעֱלֶ֗ה	1	See the discussion in the Introduction to 2 Samuel of how the ULT represents the Hebrew verb form for instruction or obligation. Alternate translation: [Should I go]

2:3	sobe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אִ֣ישׁ וּ⁠בֵית֑⁠וֹ	1	The author is using the term **house** by association to mean the people who lived in the same house with a man. He means the people in that man’s household. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [each man with his family]
2:3	j4i8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	בְּ⁠עָרֵ֥י חֶבְרֽוֹן	1	The author is using the plural form **cities** in a context where the singular term “city” would suffice, since Hebron was a single city. This suggests that he is using the plural form to refer to Hebron and its surrounding villages. Your language may use plural forms in the same way. If not, you could express the meaning in another way. Alternate translation: [in and around the city of Hebron]
2:4	mo2j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בֵּ֣ית יְהוּדָ֑ה	1	Here, **house** represents all the people descended from a particular person. It envisions them as if they were one household living together. So **the house of Judah** figuratively means all the people descended from Judah, one of the sons of Jacob or Israel. Alternate translation: [the people of the tribe of Judah]

Alternate translation: [may Yahweh treat you kindly and be faithful to you]

Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this adjective with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: [And I myself will also do good things for you]
2:7	zseg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	תֶּחֱזַ֣קְנָה יְדֵי⁠כֶ֗ם וִֽ⁠הְיוּ֙ לִ⁠בְנֵי־חַ֔יִל כִּי־מֵ֖ת אֲדֹנֵי⁠כֶ֣ם שָׁא֑וּל וְ⁠גַם־אֹתִ֗⁠י מָשְׁח֧וּ בֵית־יְהוּדָ֛ה לְ⁠מֶ֖לֶךְ עֲלֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: [since your master Saul has died, and also the house of Judah has anointed me as king over them, may your hands be strong, and be sons of valor]
2:7	me6h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	תֶּחֱזַ֣קְנָה יְדֵי⁠כֶ֗ם	1	David is using one part of the people of Jabesh Gilead, their **hands**, to mean all of them in the act of being courageous.

In your translation, you could spell it the way it sounds in your language. Alternatively, you could use a word or phrase from your language that expresses the meaning of this name. However, the exact meaning is uncertain. One possible meaning is “The Field of the Sides,” which would be an allusion to the way each soldier stabbed his opponent in the side. Another possible meaning is “The Field of the Swords” or “The Field of the Daggers,” which would be an allusion to the weapons that the soldiers used. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region and it suggests one of these meanings, you may wish to suggest the same meaning in your translation.

3:intro	ka39				0	# 2 Samuel 3 Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the story of how David became king of Israel. It first lists briefly the sons who were born to David in Hebron while he was still the king only of the tribe of Judah. It then describes how Abner, who had been Saul’s general, turned against Ishbosheth and offered to make David the king of all the Israelite tribes. Abner fulfilled David’s condition of returning his wife Michal to him. But when Abner came to meet with David, David’s general Joab treacherously murdered him. The chapter concludes by describing how David cursed Joab for doing this, how he gave Abner an honorable burial, and how he composed a song to grieve Abner’s death.\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetic song in [3:33–34](../03/33.md).\n\nYou may choose to present the list of David’s sons in [3:2–5](../03/02.md) the way a list would appear in your culture. For example, you might put the title and concluding summary on separate lines and the names of each son on a separate line, like this:\n\nNow sons were born to David in Hebron.\nAnd his firstborn was Amnon, to Ahinoam the Jezreelite.\nAnd his second was Kileab, to Abigail, the wife of Nabal the Carmelite.\nAnd the third was Absalom, the son of Maacah, the daughter of Talmai, the king of Geshur.\nAnd the fourth was Adonijah, the son of Haggith.\nAnd the fifth was Shephatiah, the son of Abital.\nAnd the sixth was Ithream, to Eglah, the wife of David.\nThese were born to David in Hebron.\n\nThere are many similar lists later in the historical books of the Bible. Decide as a team how you will present them.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Did Abner have sexual relations with Rizpah?\n\nIn [3:7](../03/07.md), Ishbosheth accuses Abner of having sexual relations with Rizpah, who had been the concubine of his father Saul. In this culture, it was the duty of a son who succeeded his father as king to protect and care for the women who had been his father’s wives and concubines. If someone else married or had sexual relations with one of these women, that was an implicit assertion of a claim to the throne, as [1 Kings 2:22](../../1ki/02/22.md) illustrates. Since the author says in the previous verse that Abner “was strengthening himself” (becoming powerful) within Ishbosheth’s kingdom, it is possible that he was taking royal prerogatives for himself. However, it is not entirely clear from the text whether Abner actually did have sexual relations with Rizpah or whether Ishbosheth only suspected him of this. When Abner replies in [3:8](../03/08.md), “Yet today you charge against me the iniquity of a woman!” he could either be insisting that he had not done this or that Ishbosheth should not consider that he had done anything disloyal even though he had done this. The author may mean to leave this uncertain, and so we recommend that you do the same in your translation.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### “cut” a covenant\n\nIn [3:12](../03/12.md), Abner sends messengers to David to say on his behalf, “Cut your covenant with me.” The expression “cut” a “covenant” means “make a covenant.” The word “cut” is used because in some covenant ceremonies, the participants would cut up animals and then walk between the pieces. This was to indicate, “If I break this covenant, may I be destroyed in this same way.” It is not necessary to understand this background to covenant ceremonies in order to understand the action in this chapter, so you do not have to use the term “cut” in your translation. You could simply say “make,” or you could use an expression from your own language and culture.\n\n### Paltiel\n\nIn [3:15](../03/15.md), the author uses the name Paltiel for the man to whom Saul gave Michal as a wife when he took her away from David. In [1 Samuel 25:44](../../1sa/25/44.md), the author calls this man Palti. From ancient times, Jewish interpreters have stated that in [2 Samuel 3:15](../03/15.md), the author adds the term “el,” which means “God,” to the end of Palti’s name to show that he was a godly man who did not have sexual relations with Michal, since he knew that she was actually David’s wife. While the biblical text does not state this explicitly, it is a reasonable explanation of why the author gives this man’s name in two different forms. It receives some support, as Jewish tradition also states, from the fact that the place where Paltiel turned back from following Michal became known as Bahurim. That word means “youths,” suggesting that Paltiel and Michal had been like unmarried youths in their relationship with each other, or in other words, that they had not had sexual relations. Otherwise, according to [Deuteronomy 24:4](../../deu/24/04.md), it would not have been lawful for David to take Michal back as his wife. Whatever the reason, we recommend that you present this man’s name in two different forms in these places in your translation, since that is what the author does.

This provides the background for other events he will describe that began to happen during this time.

Your culture may also associate anger with heat, and if so, you could use its characteristic expression in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: [And Abner became steaming mad] or [And Abner became extremely angry]

If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for those purposes, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [I am not the head of a dog that is to Judah!] or [I am not some kind of dog that is to Judah!]
3:8	opu1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הֲ⁠רֹ֨אשׁ כֶּ֥לֶב אָנֹ֘כִי֮ אֲשֶׁ֣ר לִֽ⁠יהוּדָה֒	1	In this culture, people considered wild dogs dirty and regarded them with contempt. Abner is suggesting that the Judeans are contemptible for not supporting Saul’s son as their next king. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [I am not some contemptible Judean!]

Alternate translation: [I am treating your father Saul’s descendants, brothers, and friends kindly] or [I am remaining loyal to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers, and to his friends]
3:8	vln5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠לֹ֥א הִמְצִיתִ֖⁠ךָ בְּ⁠יַד־דָּוִ֑ד	1	Here, **hand** represents the capability of a person.

3:8	tfhm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וַ⁠תִּפְקֹ֥ד עָלַ֛⁠י עֲוֺ֥ן הָ⁠אִשָּׁ֖ה	1	See the discussion in the Introduction to this chapter of how, if Abner had actually had sexual relations with Rizpah, that would have been a symbolic action asserting a claim to be the king.
3:9	ano0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge		0	Abner swears in this verse that he is going to do something, but he does not describe until the next verse what he is going to do. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could create a verse bridge for [verses 9–10](../03/09.md) and have Abner first describe what he is going to do and then swear that he will do it. (That would not change the meaning, only the order of the information.) The UST models one way to do that.

What he states as a condition (“if”) is what he is swearing to do. Use a natural way in your language to express an oath. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could put the condition before the consequence. Alternate translation: [I swear that I will do for David according to what Yahweh has sworn to him, and if I do not, then may God do thus to Abner, and thus may he add to him]

If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: [Thus may God do to me, Abner, and thus may he add to me]
3:9	ndzb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	כֹּֽה־יַעֲשֶׂ֤ה אֱלֹהִים֙ לְ⁠אַבְנֵ֔ר וְ⁠כֹ֖ה יֹסִ֣יף ל֑⁠וֹ	1	When Abner says **thus may he add**, he is using a common expression of his culture.

Abner could be saying that if he does not take away the privileged position of Saul’s family, then he wants God to take away his privileged position as a powerful leader. The UST models one way to express that meaning. (2) could be a general expression introducing the entire statement as a reference to severe punishment. Alternate translation: [May God punish me, Abner, very severely]

In your translation, use a natural way of introducing direct quotations in your language. It may not be necessary to represent this term explicitly. Alternate translation: [saying, “To whom {is} the land? Cut your covenant with me]
3:12	hpyr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	לְ⁠מִי־אָ֑רֶץ	1	Abner is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Abner could mean: (1) that he, not Ishbosheth, actually controls the **land**, so if David makes a covenant **with** him, he can deliver **all of Israel** to David. Alternate translation: [The land is under my control!]; (2) that since Yahweh promised David the kingship, Abner will help him become the king of all of Israel on that basis. Alternate translation: [You are the rightful king of the land!]
3:12	lqwa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	כָּרְתָ֤⁠ה בְרִֽיתְ⁠ךָ֙ אִתִּ֔⁠י	1	Abner is using **Cut your covenant** as a common expression of his culture to mean “make your covenant.” If this phrase would not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [Make a covenant with me]
3:12	c7sg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠הִנֵּה֙	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [1:12](../01/12.md).
3:12	v74k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	יָדִ֣⁠י עִמָּ֔⁠ךְ	1	Abner is using his **hand** to represent himself in the act of accompanying and assisting David.

He is doing that to emphasize that he is making a commitment to Abner. If a speaker of your language would use an explicit pronoun for the same purpose, you may want to use that construction in your translation. If not, your language may have other ways of showing the meaning here. Alternate translation: [I agree to cut a covenant with you]

3:15	jyif		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	אִ֑ישׁ	1	Since David refers to Michal as “my wife” in the previous verse, it may not be appropriate in your language and culture to describe Paltiel as **{her} husband** here.

3:16	gm2d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לֵ֥ךְ שׁ֖וּב	1	Abner could be using the term **Go** to tell Paltiel: (1) that he must now **return**. **Bahurim** was near the border of Judah, and Abner did not want Paltiel to enter the territory that David was ruling. Alternate translation: [It is time for you to return]; (2) that Paltiel must leave that place, where Michal was, and return to his home without her.

4:intro	hm82				0	# 2 Samuel 4 Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the story of how David became king of Israel. It describes how two of Ishbosheth’s military commanders, Recab and Baanah, murdered him and brought his head to David at Hebron. They thought that David would reward them for killing Saul’s son, since Saul had tried to kill David. But David instead executed them for committing this murder. This made it clear that David had never wanted to hurt Saul’s family. (David had sworn to Saul in [1 Samuel 24:22](../../1sa/24/22.md) that he would not kill his descendants.)\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Why does the author describe the Beerothites fleeing to Gittaim?\n\nIn [4:3](../04/03.md), the author relates that the Beerothites (that is, the inhabitants of the Gibeonite city of Beeroth) had fled to another city called Gittaim. (The location of that city is now uncertain.) The author provides this as background information to help readers understand what happens next in the story. However, it is not clear why this information is significant. Here is one possibility. In [21:1–2](../21/01.md), the author describes how Saul tried to destroy the Gibeonites and seize their land and cities, even though the Israelites had sworn never to harm them. It is possible that the author is describing how some of the Beerothites fled from Saul to Gittaim. If that is what he is describing, then it may be that the man named Rimmon, whom he mentions in the previous verse, and his family were survivors of Saul’s attempted massacre. His sons Baanah and Recab might later have found their way into the service of Ishbosheth as military commanders, but they might still have wanted to get revenge against Saul for killing so many members of their people group. This could be why they murdered his son Ishbosheth. However, the biblical text does not say this specifically, so we recommend that you do not suggest in your translation why the author is providing this background information.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Why does the author call Baanah and Recab “sons of Benjamin”?\n\nIn [4:2](../04/02.md), the author introduces two men, Baanah and Recab, whom he says were “from the sons of Benjamin.” That phrase would ordinarily indicate that they were descendants of Benjamin, as in the case of the phrase “the sons of Judah” in [1:18](../01/18.md). However, as the author states, Baanah and Recab were actually the sons of a Beerothite man named Rimmon. Beeroth was one of four cities in which Gibeonites, members of a different people group, lived among the Israelites. So it is possible that Baanah and Recab were Gibeonites, not Israelites. However, as the author explains, Beeroth was considered to be part of the territory of the tribe of Benjamin, and so the Gibeonite inhabitants of that city were considered to be members of that tribe. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state this meaning plainly. A note to [4:2](../04/02.md) suggests one way to do that.
4:1	c1pa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יִּרְפּ֖וּ יָדָ֑י⁠ו	1	The author is reporting that Ishbosheth’s **hands dropped** in order to indicate that he lost his strength and courage.

4:1	x3ks		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	נִבְהָֽלוּ	1	The expression **was terrified** is a passive verbal form.

In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture. See the discussion in the Introduction to this chapter of why the author may provide this information.
4:3	o9z1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עַ֖ד הַ⁠יּ֥וֹם הַ⁠זֶּֽה	1	See the discussion of this phrase in the Introduction to 2 Samuel. The author is using this phrase to refer to the time when he was writing. In your translation, make clear that the phrase refers to a time that is already past. Avoid giving the impression the phrase means “to the present day.” Alternate translation: [right up to the time of this writing]
4:4	kpae		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בֶּן־חָמֵ֣שׁ שָׁנִ֣ים הָיָ֡ה	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [2:10](../02/10.md). Alternate translation: [He was five years of age]

If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [when people came from Jezreel and reported about Saul and Jonathan]
4:5	w5ri		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	שֹׁכֵ֔ב אֵ֖ת מִשְׁכַּ֥ב הַֽ⁠צָּהֳרָֽיִם	1	The phrase **bed of noon** describes a special bed or couch on which someone would rest or sleep during the midday rest period that was common in this region where the middle of the day would be very hot. If your readers would not be familiar with this custom, you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: [was resting during the heat of midday] or [was taking his midday nap]

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could create a verse bridge for [verses 6–7](../04/06.md) and relate these events only once. The UST models one way to do that.
4:6	gn8e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ֠⁠הֵנָּה	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [1:12](../01/12.md). Alternate translation: [Then suddenly]
4:8	kw1f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֹֽיִבְ⁠ךָ֔ אֲשֶׁ֥ר בִּקֵּ֖שׁ אֶת־נַפְשֶׁ֑⁠ךָ	1	Rechab and Baanah are using this phrase to describe Saul, not Ishbosheth. You may be able to use punctuation or some other convention of your language to make this clear.
4:8	k1wq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֶת־נַפְשֶׁ֑⁠ךָ	1	By saying that Saul sought David’s **life**, Rechab and Baanah mean that Saul sought to take his life, that is, to kill him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [to murder you]
4:8	zzwb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	לַֽ⁠אדֹנִ֨⁠י הַ⁠מֶּ֤לֶךְ	1	One of the sons of Rimmon is addressing David, so he calls him **my** lord, but since he is speaking on behalf of both of them, it may be more natural in your language to use a plural pronoun. Alternate translation: [to our lord the king]
4:8	crt4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	לַֽ⁠אדֹנִ֨⁠י הַ⁠מֶּ֤לֶךְ	1	Even though the sons of Rimmon are addressing David directly, one of them is speaking of him in the third person as **my lord the king** to show respect. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in a respectful form in the second person. Alternate translation: [to you, my lord the king] or [to you, our lord the king]
4:8	o8yh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ⁠מִ⁠זַּרְעֽ⁠וֹ	1	The speaker is speaking here of descendants as if they were **seed**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [and against his descendants]
4:9	zz05		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יַּ֨עַן דָּוִ֜ד אֶת־רֵכָ֣ב ׀ וְ⁠אֶת־בַּעֲנָ֣ה אָחִ֗י⁠ו בְּנֵ֛י רִמּ֥וֹן הַ⁠בְּאֵֽרֹתִ֖י וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר לָ⁠הֶ֑ם	1	The expression **and he said to them** introduces a direct quotation. In your translation, use a natural way of introducing direct quotations in your language. It may not be necessary to represent this expression explicitly. Alternate translation: [But David responded to Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite]
4:9	h6kh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-oathformula	חַי־יְהוָ֕ה אֲשֶׁר־פָּדָ֥ה אֶת־נַפְשִׁ֖⁠י מִ⁠כָּל־צָרָֽה	1	Following the custom of his culture, David is swearing an oath by guaranteeing it by something he holds sacred. David is using this oath to swear that what he says in the next verse is true. Use a natural way in your language to express an oath.
4:10	ibba		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	הַ⁠מַּגִּיד֩ לִ֨⁠י לֵ⁠אמֹ֜ר הִנֵּה־מֵ֣ת שָׁא֗וּל	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: [the one who declared to me that Saul was dead]
4:10	uzn4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠הֽוּא־הָיָ֤ה כִ⁠מְבַשֵּׂר֙ בְּ⁠עֵינָ֔י⁠ו	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [3:19](../03/19.md). Alternate translation: [and he thought that he was bringing good news]

4:10	bzya		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	אֲשֶׁ֥ר לְ⁠תִתִּ⁠י־ל֖⁠וֹ בְּשֹׂרָֽה	1	In this figure of speech, David actually means to communicate the opposite of the literal meaning of his words. (By saying that he gave him **a reward for good news**, he means that he killed the messenger for bringing what the messenger wrongly thought was good news.) If a speaker of your language would not say the opposite of what he meant, you could translate the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [which was how I punished him for telling me that he had killed Saul as if that had been good news]
4:11	aqlk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	אַ֞ף	1	David is using this expression to convey a strong feeling, his conviction that the crime of Rechab and Baanah is much greater than the crime of the person who told him that Saul was dead. There may be an equivalent word or phrase in your language that you can use in your translation to convey this feeling.
4:11	b7lo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	אַ֞ף	1	David is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: [How much more would I punish rather than reward]
4:11	dh6b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	אֲנָשִׁ֣ים רְשָׁעִ֗ים & אֶת־אִישׁ־צַדִּ֛יק	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **wickedness** and **righteousness**, you could express the same ideas in other ways. Alternate translation: [wicked men … a righteous man]
4:11	zq10		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וְ⁠עַתָּ֗ה	1	**And now** was an expression that speakers in this culture commonly used to introduce their main topic. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. You could also use plain language. See how you translated the similar expression in [2:6](../02/06.md).
4:11	b06r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠ל֨וֹא אֲבַקֵּ֤שׁ אֶת־דָּמ⁠וֹ֙ מִ⁠יֶּדְ⁠כֶ֔ם וּ⁠בִעַרְתִּ֥י אֶתְ⁠כֶ֖ם מִן־הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	David is using the question form to emphasize that he will certainly punish Rechab and Baanah for killing Ishbosheth. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [I should certainly seek his blood from your hand and consume you from the earth!]
4:11	kmhb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	הֲ⁠ל֨וֹא אֲבַקֵּ֤שׁ אֶת־דָּמ⁠וֹ֙ מִ⁠יֶּדְ⁠כֶ֔ם	1	David is using **seek his blood from your hand** as a common expression of his culture to mean “punish you for killing him.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [should I not punish you for killing him]
4:11	nebd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ⁠בִעַרְתִּ֥י אֶתְ⁠כֶ֖ם מִן־הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	Here, David is speaking as if he would **consume** the murderers as fire consumes something completely. This image emphasizes total destruction. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [and completely destroy you]
4:12	ny7l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וַ⁠יִּתְל֥וּ עַל־הַ⁠בְּרֵכָ֖ה בְּ⁠חֶבְר֑וֹן & בְּ⁠חֶבְרֽוֹן	1	This could mean: (1) that David’s soldiers hung up the **hands** and **feet** of Rechab and Baanah beside the pool. This would have been a symbolic action, exposing to disgrace in a public location the hands that these men had used to murder Ishbosheth and the feet that they had used to flee with his head. By this action, David would have been repudiating their deed and warning others against doing anything similar. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: [and they hung their murderous hands and fugitive feet in disgrace beside the pool in Hebron]; (2) that David’s soldiers hung the bodies of Rechab and Baanah beside the pool. This too would have disgraced them as murderers, repudiated their deed, and warned others. However, it would have been a violation of [Deuteronomy 21:23](../../deu/21/23.md), which required the Israelites to bury the body of an executed person on the same day on which he was executed. So this is less likely. Alternate translation: [and they hung their bodies in disgrace beside the pool in Hebron]
5:intro	jv2a				0	# 2 Samuel 5 Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter concludes the story of how David became king of Israel, and it begins the story of what David did as the king of Israel.\n5:1–3 The leaders of the Israelite tribes come and anoint David as their king\n5:4–5 The author formally reintroduces David as a character in the story in his new role\n5:6–10 David captures the fortress in Jerusalem and makes that city his capital\n5:11–12 Hiram, the king of Tyre, builds a palace for David\n5:13–16 The author lists the further sons David had in Jerusalem\n5:17–25 David defeats the invading Philistines\n\nIf you chose to present the list of David’s sons in [3:2–5](../03/02.md) the way a list would appear in your culture, you should present the list in [5:13–16](../05/13.md) in the same way. For example, you might put the title on a separate line and the names of three or four sons on the following lines, like this:\nAnd these are the names of the ones born to him in Jerusalem:\nShammua and Shobab and Nathan and Solomon\n and Ibhar and Elishua and Nepheg and Japhia\n and Elishama and Eliada and Eliphelet.
5:1	ixk0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	כָּל־שִׁבְטֵ֧י יִשְׂרָאֵ֛ל	1	The author is speaking of a whole, **all of the tribes of Israel**, to mean a part of that whole, representatives of the tribes who came to David. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [representatives of all of the tribes of Israel]
5:1	bxbq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	הִנְ⁠נ֛וּ	1	The tribal representatives are using the courteous expression that people in this culture would use to tell a superior that they were ready and willing to obey his orders. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. See how you translated the similar expression in [1:7](../01/07.md).
5:1	libb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	עַצְמְ⁠ךָ֥ וּֽ⁠בְשָׂרְ⁠ךָ֖ אֲנָֽחְנוּ	1	Here, **we are your bone and your flesh** was a common expression that the tribal representatives were using to affirm to David that they were related by descent from a common ancestor. If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [we are your blood relatives]
5:2	p78d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	גַּם־אֶתְמ֣וֹל גַּם־שִׁלְשׁ֗וֹם	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [3:7](../03/07.md). Alternate translation: [In the past]
5:2	es69		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	הַמּוֹצִ֥יא וְהַמֵּבִ֖יא אֶת־יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [3:25](../03/25.md). Alternate translation: [the one leading Israel on military campaigns]
5:2	izej		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֶת־יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל	1	Here the term **Israel** represents the Israelite soldiers whom David commanded. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [the Israelite soldiers]
5:2	n31c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אַתָּ֗ה הָיִ֛יתָ & אַתָּ֨ה תִרְעֶ֤ה & וְ⁠אַתָּ֛ה תִּהְיֶ֥ה	1	The Israelite leaders are stating the pronoun **you** separately, even though the verb translated as **you were** already includes this meaning. They are doing that to emphasize David’s personal role in leading the Israelite army. When Yahweh spoke to David as they describe, he was stating the pronoun **you** separately in both of these instances, even though the verbs translated as **you will shepherd** and **you will become** already included this meaning, to emphasize that he was making promises to David. If speakers of your language would use explicit pronouns for these same purposes, you may want to use that construction in your translation. If not, your language may have other ways of showing the meanings here.  Alternate translation: [you personally were … I promise that you will shepherd … and I promise that you will become]
5:2	s0zs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר יְהוָ֜ה לְ⁠ךָ֗ אַתָּ֨ה תִרְעֶ֤ה אֶת־עַמִּ⁠י֙ אֶת־יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל וְ⁠אַתָּ֛ה תִּהְיֶ֥ה לְ⁠נָגִ֖יד עַל־יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: [And they reminded David that Yahweh had told him that he would shepherd the people of Israel and become their ruler]
5:2	xj5j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	אַתָּ֨ה תִרְעֶ֤ה אֶת־עַמִּ⁠י֙ אֶת־יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל וְ⁠אַתָּ֛ה תִּהְיֶ֥ה לְ⁠נָגִ֖יד עַל־יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. It may be clearer in your language to connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: [You yourself will shepherd my people Israel, indeed, you yourself will become the ruler over Israel]
5:2	n40m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אַתָּ֨ה תִרְעֶ֤ה אֶת־עַמִּ⁠י֙ אֶת־יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל	1	Yahweh is speaking here as if David would actually **shepherd** the people of Israel as though they were sheep. This image compares the way a shepherd cares for and guides his sheep to the way a king should care for and lead his people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [You yourself will care for and guide my people Israel]
5:3	omte		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּכְרֹ֣ת לָ⁠הֶם֩ הַ⁠מֶּ֨לֶךְ דָּוִ֥ד בְּרִ֛ית	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [3:12](../03/12.md). Alternate translation: [and King David made a covenant with them]

Your language may have its own way of reintroducing participants in new roles that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: [Now David was 30 years old when he began to reign as king, and he ruled for 40 years]
5:4	su6s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בֶּן־שְׁלֹשִׁ֥ים שָׁנָ֛ה דָּוִ֖ד	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [2:10](../02/10.md). Alternate translation: [David was 30 years old]

If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different way to express the emphasis. Alternate translation: [our least capable soldiers will be able to keep you from capturing our city]
5:6	b9t7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	הַ⁠עִוְרִ֤ים וְ⁠הַ⁠פִּסְחִים֙	1	The Jebusites are using the adjectives **blind** and **lame** as nouns to mean people who cannot see and people who cannot walk well. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate these adjectives with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: [people who are blind and people who cannot walk well]
5:6	r54m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	לֵ⁠אמֹר֙	1	In this instance, the author is using the term **saying** to introduce what the Jebusites were thinking or saying to themselves. They did not say this out loud to David. In your translation, use a natural way of introducing what people said to themselves or thought. Alternate translation: [thinking to themselves]
5:7	us2h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	הִ֖יא עִ֥יר דָּוִֽד	1	The author is providing background information to explain to readers that the fortified area that he calls **Zion** is the same area that they know as **the City of David**. In your translation, present this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
5:8	w85g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	יְבֻסִי֙	1	David is not referring to a specific **Jebusite**.

Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate these adjectives with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: [people who cannot walk well and people who cannot see]
5:8	j1ma		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	שנאה נֶ֣פֶשׁ דָּוִ֑ד	1	The expression **hated by the soul of David** is a passive verbal form. If your language would not use that form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [whom David’s soul hates]
5:8	rjyu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	שנאה נֶ֣פֶשׁ דָּוִ֑ד	1	David is using **the soul of David** to represent David himself.

In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
5:8	vm9x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	עִוֵּ֣ר וּ⁠פִסֵּ֔חַ	1	The people using this popular saying are not referring to a specific **blind** or **lame** person. They mean blind and lame people in general. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use an expression that would be more natural in your language. Alternate translation: [A blind person or a lame person]
5:8	fo04		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יֹֽאמְר֔וּ	1	Here the author is using the pronoun **they** in a general sense, not to refer to specific people. Use an expression for this that would be natural in your language. Alternate translation: [it came to be said] or [it became a saying]
5:8	o82u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הַ⁠בָּֽיִת	1	In this saying, **the house** means the palace where the king lived. You could clarify this if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [the palace]
5:9	v5ys		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	הַ⁠מִּלּ֖וֹא	1	The word **Millo** is the name of a place. (It was likely a raised platform or landfill that formed part of Jerusalem’s fortifications.)

Alternate translation: [And since Yahweh, the God of Armies, was with him, David went, going and becoming great]
5:10	w9tt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יֵּ֥לֶךְ דָּוִ֖ד הָל֣וֹךְ וְ⁠גָד֑וֹל	1	The author is using **went, going and becoming great** as a common expression of his culture to mean “kept becoming greater and greater.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [And David kept becoming greater and greater]
5:10	lh5g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	עִמּֽ⁠וֹ	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [3:12](../03/12.md). Alternate translation: [was helping him]

Alternate translation: [Since giving, I will give the Philistines into your hand, go up]
5:19	g584		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	נָתֹ֥ן אֶתֵּ֛ן	1	Yahweh is repeating forms of the verb **give** in order to intensify his expression of the idea that it conveys. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the intensification. Alternate translation: [I will certainly give]
5:20	gyt1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יַּכֵּ֣⁠ם & דָּוִד֒	1	See the discussion of the term “struck” in the Introduction to 2 Samuel. The meaning of that term here and in [verses 24](../05/24.md) and [25](../05/25.md) is “defeated.” Alternate translation: [and David defeated them]

5:20	tz3f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	קָרָ֛א שֵֽׁם־הַ⁠מָּק֥וֹם הַ⁠ה֖וּא	1	It might seem that the expression **called the name of** contains extra information that would not be natural to express in your language.

The Philistines had brought these idols into battle with them in the hopes that the gods they represented would help them defeat David and the Israelites. Instead, the gods themselves were shown to be helpless. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action in the text or in a footnote. Alternate translation: [and David and his men carried off their idols to show how weak and helpless the Philistine gods were compared to Yahweh]

If this phrase would not have that meaning in your language in this context, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [Do not make a frontal attack]

5:25	n616		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	מִ⁠גֶּ֖בַע	1	The Septuagint (an ancient Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible) and the parallel passage in [1 Chronicles 14:16](../../1ch/14/16.md) read “Gibeon” instead of **Geba**. That may have been the original reading, particularly since the location of Gibeon suits the account of this battle better than the location of Geba. At one point in the process of transmission, scribes may have left out the additional letters that would have spelled “Gibeon” rather than “Geba,” either accidentally or as a way of abbreviating. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
6:intro	aen5				0	# 2 Samuel 6 Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the story of what David did as the king of Israel. It describes how he brought the Box of Yahweh to Jerusalem and placed it in an honored location in the fortress where he lived, the City of David.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Why did David offer sacrifices after the people carrying the Box had taken six steps?\n\nThe author relates in [6:13](../06/13.md) that David had the people who were carrying the Box of Yahweh stop after taking six steps so that he could offer sacrifices. Some interpreters believe that this was a symbolic action that alluded to the commandment to work for six days and then observe a day of rest and worship. The parallel passage in [1 Chronicles 15:2–14](../15/02.md) tells how David specifically said how important it was for the Israelites to obey Yahweh’s instructions in the law. So this action could have been a symbolic affirmation of that. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. However, since this interpretation is not entirely certain, you may wish to describe it in general terms. You might say, for example, that “when the lifters of the Box of Yahweh had stepped six steps, David had them pause reverently, and he worshiped Yahweh by sacrificing an ox and a fatling.”
6:1	arfo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	בָּח֥וּר	1	The author is using the adjective **chosen** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this adjective with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: [the select warriors] or [the elite troops]
6:2	dx0h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יָּ֣קָם & דָּוִ֗ד	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [2:14](../02/14.md). Alternate translation: [And David took action]
6:2	ahnt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	מִֽ⁠בַּעֲלֵ֖י יְהוּדָ֑ה	1	The parallel passage in [1 Chronicles 13:6](../../1ch/13/06.md) explains that **Baalah** was another name for Kiriath Jearim. That was where the Box had remained since the Philistines returned it after capturing it, according to [1 Samuel 7:2](../../1sa/07/02.md). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain this in the text of your translation or in a footnote.
6:2	s7bu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	לְ⁠הַעֲל֣וֹת	1	In keeping with what is usual for his language and culture, the author is marking travel for change in elevation. If this expression contains extra information that would not be natural to express in your language, you could shorten it. Alternate translation: [to bring]
6:2	yq5m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	אֲשֶׁר־נִקְרָ֣א שֵׁ֗ם	1	The expression **whose name is called** is a passive verbal form. If your language would not use that form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [which people call]
6:3	lvx0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֲשֶׁ֣ר בַּ⁠גִּבְעָ֑ה	1	The author assumes that his readers will know that by **on the hill**, he means a certain hill within the city of Baalah, that is, Kiriath Jearim. Since modern readers would not recognize the identity of this hill, it may be more natural to speak of it in general terms. If you have already translated the book of 1 Samuel, see how you translated the similar expression in [1 Samuel 7:1](../../1sa/07/01.md). Alternate translation: [which was on a hill]
6:3	qm3h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֶת־הָ⁠עֲגָלָ֥ה חֲדָשָֽׁה	1	The author is speaking of the **new cart** to mean the oxen that were pulling the cart. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [the oxen that were pulling the new cart]
6:4	o5vm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	וַ⁠יִּשָּׂאֻ֗⁠הוּ מִ⁠בֵּ֤ית אֲבִֽינָדָב֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר בַּ⁠גִּבְעָ֔ה	1	The Septuagint (an ancient Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible) and the parallel passage in 1 Chronicles do not have this sentence, which seems to have been repeated accidentally from the previous verse. Without it, the text of [verses 3–4](../06/03.md) would sensibly read, “And Uzzah and Ahio, the sons of Abinadab, were leading the new cart with the Box of God” (that is, the new cart that had the Box of God on it). Many versions of the Bible do not include this sentence. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to omit the sentence if it does.
6:4	hpml		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠אַחְי֕וֹ הֹלֵ֖ךְ לִ⁠פְנֵ֥י הָ⁠אָרֽוֹן	1	The author assumes that his readers will know that Ahio and Uzzah were following the custom of this culture for steadying a load on a cart that animals were pulling. One person would walk ahead of the cart, leading and guiding the animals, while another person would walk next to the cart to make sure that the load did not fall off. By saying that **Ahio was walking to the face of the Box**, he also means that Uzzah was walking alongside the cart that was carrying it, as the story itself indicates in [6:6](../06/06.md). You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. The UST models one way to do that.
6:4	x2hp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לִ⁠פְנֵ֥י	1	Here, **to the face of** represents “in front of.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [in front of]
6:4	pcer		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הָ⁠אָרֽוֹן	1	Here, **the Box** represents the oxen that were pulling the cart that was carrying the Box.

6:5	fpjd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י יְהוָ֔ה	1	Here, **face** represents “presence.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language.

If your readers would not be familiar with what a tambourine is, you could use the name of a similar instrument that your readers would recognize, or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: [and with hand drums] or [and with jingling drums]
6:5	myww		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	וּ⁠בִ⁠מְנַֽעַנְעִ֖ים	1	A **sistrum** is a kind of musical instrument consisting of a handle and a U-shaped metal frame with loose metal crossbars that jingle when people shake the frame. If your readers would not be familiar with what a sistrum is, you could use the name of a similar instrument that your readers would recognize, or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: [and with rattles] or [and with shaking instruments]
6:5	ca1t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	וּֽ⁠בְ⁠צֶלְצֶלִֽים	1	A **cymbal** is a kind of musical instrument made of two metal discs that people strike together to make a loud, ringing sound.

6:7	eqnh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יִּֽחַר־אַ֤ף יְהוָה֙	1	The author is describing Yahweh becoming extremely angry by alluding to the way a person’s **nose** may become hot and red when he is angry. Your culture may also associate anger with heat or with a particular part of the body, and if so, you could use its characteristic expression in your translation. You could also use plain language. See how you translated the similar expression in [3:8](../03/08.md). Alternate translation: [And Yahweh blazed with fury] or [And Yahweh became extremely angry]

6:8	tp3c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	פָּרַ֧ץ יְהוָ֛ה פֶּ֖רֶץ	1	It might seem that the expression **Yahweh had broken out an outbreak** contains extra information that would not be natural to express in your language. If so, you could shorten it. Alternate translation: [Yahweh had broken out]
6:8	qf82		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	פֶּ֣רֶץ עֻזָּ֔ה	1	The name **Perez Uzzah** means “Outbreak against Uzzah.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain this in the text of your translation or in a footnote.

7:intro	c6fb				0	# 2 Samuel 7 Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the story of what David did as the king of Israel. It describes how he wanted to build a temple (a “house”) for Yahweh, but Yahweh told him that he would build a dynasty (a “house”) for David by having his descendants succeed him as king.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Multiple levels of quotation in Yahweh’s message to Nathan in [7:5–16](../07/05.md)\n\nYahweh speaks a message to the prophet Nathan in [verses 5–16](../07/05.md). Within this message, there are second-level, third-level, and fourth-level quotations. In other words, the entire message is something that Yahweh said and that the author is quoting, so it is a first-level quotation. But within it, Yahweh tells Nathan what he should say, so that is a quotation within a quotation, or a second-level quotation. Yahweh tells Nathan that he should tell David that Yahweh says something, and that is a third-level quotation. Within it, there is a further direct quotation, which is a fourth-level one. Your language may use quotation marks or some other punctuation or convention to indicate various levels of quotation. The ULT models one way to do that. You could also translate the whole message in such a way that there are not quotations within quotations. The UST models one way to do that.\n\n### David referring to himself in the third person in [7:19–29](../07/19.md)\n\nAs David responds to the message that Yahweh sent him through the prophet Nathan, he often speaks of himself in the third person as **your servant** to show humility. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in a humble form in the first person throughout these verses.
7:1	gqd9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֕י	1	The author is using the words **And it happened** to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event.

He means that Yahweh made it so none of the enemy nations around him were at war with him.

It may be more natural in your language to use a plural form here. Alternate translation: [in the midst of tent-curtains] or [in a tent]
7:2	jvpz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַֽ⁠אֲרוֹן֙ הָֽ⁠אֱלֹהִ֔ים יֹשֵׁ֖ב בְּ⁠ת֥וֹךְ הַ⁠יְרִיעָֽה	1	The implication is that David wanted to build a splendid temple for Yahweh and put the Box in it.

7:3	qzjw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לֵ֣ךְ עֲשֵׂ֑ה	1	Nathan is not telling David to **go** somewhere. He is saying **go** to mean that David should take action. (The meaning is similar to that of the term “arise” in [3:21](../03/21.md).) Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: [go ahead and do] or [take action and do]

He is doing that to emphasize that David is wanting to do something that he has never asked the Israelites to do for him. If a speaker of your language would use an explicit pronoun for the same purpose, you may want to use that construction in your translation. If not, your language may have other ways of showing the meaning here. Alternate translation: [No, you shall not build a house for my dwelling]
7:5	cnub		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בַ֖יִת לְ⁠שִׁבְתִּֽ⁠י	1	Yahweh is speaking here as if David wants to build him a physical **house** as his **dwelling**.

Yahweh is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: [with human punishments]
7:14	wj3b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠שֵׁ֣בֶט אֲנָשִׁ֔ים וּ⁠בְ⁠נִגְעֵ֖י בְּנֵ֥י אָדָֽם	1	Here, **rod** and **blows** represent punishment or discipline. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [with human discipline]
7:14	x6fk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בְּ⁠שֵׁ֣בֶט אֲנָשִׁ֔ים וּ⁠בְ⁠נִגְעֵ֖י בְּנֵ֥י אָדָֽם	1	This could mean: (1) that Yahweh will discipline David’s son with measures of the same type and purpose that humans use to correct their children, not with divine judgments that would destroy him and his descendants. Alternate translation: [with measures such as humans use to correct their children]; (2) that Yahweh will use human beings as his agents to punish David’s son. Alternate translation: [I will use people to punish him]
7:14	npmm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	בְּנֵ֥י אָדָֽם	1	Here the masculine term **sons of man** has a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use language in your translation that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: [human beings]
7:15	sd9b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ⁠חַסְדִּ֖⁠י לֹא־יָס֣וּר מִמֶּ֑⁠נּוּ	1	Yahweh is speaking of **covenant faithfulness** as if it were a living thing that could **turn away** from someone. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [But I will not stop treating you with covenant faithfulness]
7:15	jifl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	מִמֶּ֑⁠נּוּ	1	The word **you** is plural here because Yahweh is using it to mean both David and his descendants. So use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction. Other languages may have other ways of making the meaning clear. Alternate translation: [from you and your descendants]
7:15	rvuv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֤ר הֲסִרֹ֨תִי֙ מֵ⁠עִ֣ם שָׁא֔וּל	1	Here, Yahweh is speaking as if he had physically **turned it away** his covenant faithfulness away from Saul. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [as I stopped treating Saul with it]
7:15	fz9n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הֲסִרֹ֖תִי מִ⁠לְּ⁠פָנֶֽי⁠ךָ	1	Here, **face** represents the area in front of someone. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [I turned away from in front of you]
7:15	bft4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הֲסִרֹ֖תִי מִ⁠לְּ⁠פָנֶֽי⁠ךָ	1	Yahweh is speaking as if Saul had been in front of David, that is, in his way, as David moved toward becoming king. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [I removed so that you could be king]
7:16	ki0j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	וְ⁠נֶאְמַ֨ן בֵּיתְ⁠ךָ֧ וּ⁠מַֽמְלַכְתְּ⁠ךָ֛ עַד־עוֹלָ֖ם לְ⁠פָנֶ֑י⁠ךָ כִּֽסְאֲ⁠ךָ֔ יִהְיֶ֥ה נָכ֖וֹן עַד־עוֹלָֽם	1	The two phrases **your house and your kingdom will be confirmed to forever to your face** and **your throne will be established to forever** mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. It may be clearer in your language to connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: [And your house and your kingdom will be confirmed to forever to your face, yes, your throne will be established to forever]
7:16	ivtr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠נֶאְמַ֨ן בֵּיתְ⁠ךָ֧ וּ⁠מַֽמְלַכְתְּ⁠ךָ֛	1	The expression **will be confirmed** is a passive verbal form. If your language would not use that form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who does the action, the context indicates that it is God. Alternate translation: [And I will confirm your house and your kingdom]
7:16	fie0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	בֵּיתְ⁠ךָ֧ וּ⁠מַֽמְלַכְתְּ⁠ךָ֛	1	The terms **house** and **kingdom** mean similar things. Yahweh is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: [your royal dynasty]
7:16	snfb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לְ⁠פָנֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1	Here, **face** represents what is in front of someone, but in time rather than in space. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [beyond you into the future]
7:16	hqp4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	כִּֽסְאֲ⁠ךָ֔ יִהְיֶ֥ה נָכ֖וֹן	1	The expression **will be established** is a passive verbal form. If your language would not use that form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who does the action, the context indicates that it is God. Alternate translation: [I will establish your throne]
7:16	sxqz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	כִּֽסְאֲ⁠ךָ֔	1	Here, **throne** represents royal authority or rule. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [The reign of your descendants]
7:16	gc8w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	יִהְיֶ֥ה נָכ֖וֹן עַד־עוֹלָֽם	1	This is the end of Yahweh’s message to Nathan. Review your translation of [verses 5–16](../07/05.md) to ensure that you have consistently used punctuation or some other convention of your language to indicate the second-level, third-level, and fourth-level quotations in this message. Alternatively, you may have decided to translate the entire message in such a way that there are not quotations within quotations. If so, ensure that you have done that consistently.

The term **vision** tells how Yahweh conveyed these **words** to David. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning in a different way. Alternate translation: [According to all of these words that Yahweh had spoken to him in a vision]
7:17	asrv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	כְּ⁠כֹל֙ הַ⁠דְּבָרִ֣ים הָ⁠אֵ֔לֶּה וּ⁠כְ⁠כֹ֖ל הַ⁠חִזָּי֣וֹן הַ⁠זֶּ֑ה	1	Here, **words** represents what Yahweh said by using words. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [According to all of these things that Yahweh had said to him in a vision]
7:18	ur5k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י יְהוָ֑ה	1	Here, **face** represents “presence.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [in the presence of Yahweh]
7:18	tiqx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מִ֣י אָנֹכִ֞י אֲדֹנָ֤⁠י יְהוִה֙ וּ⁠מִ֣י בֵיתִ֔⁠י כִּ֥י הֲבִיאֹתַ֖⁠נִי עַד־הֲלֹֽם	1	David is using the question form to express his humility and amazement at what God has done for him. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: [I am not so significant, my Lord Yahweh, and neither is my house, that you should have brought me to here!]
7:18	tqlh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בֵיתִ֔⁠י	1	By **my house**, David probably means his “father’s house,” that is, the extended family from which he comes. Alternate translation: [my family]
7:18	q2dl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כִּ֥י הֲבִיאֹתַ֖⁠נִי עַד־הֲלֹֽם	1	The implication is that **here** means being the king of Israel. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [that you have made me the king of Israel]
7:19	b1n0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠תִּקְטַן֩ ע֨וֹד זֹ֤את בְּ⁠עֵינֶ֨י⁠ךָ֙	1	David is using **this was small in your eyes** as a common expression of his culture to mean “you considered this to be insignificant.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [And you considered even this a small thing]
7:19	d8uo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	בֵּֽית־עַבְדְּ⁠ךָ֖	1	David is speaking of himself in the third person as **your servant** to show humility. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in a humble form in the first person, here and in the rest of this chapter. Alternate translation: [my house]
7:19	q9p7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בֵּֽית־עַבְדְּ⁠ךָ֖	1	Here, **house** means all the people descended from a particular person. It envisions them as if they were one household living together. So **the house of your servant** figuratively means all the people who would descend from David. Alternate translation: [my descendants]
7:19	rx9j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠זֹ֛את תּוֹרַ֥ת הָ⁠אָדָ֖ם אֲדֹנָ֥⁠י יְהוִֽה	1	This could mean: (1) that David is marveling that Yahweh has established the perpetual reign of his descendants as a **law** that people must obey. Alternate translation: [And you, my Lord Yahweh, have made the perpetual reign of my descendants a law that people must obey!]; (2) that David is marveling that Yahweh has said that if his descendants do wrong, he will correct them with human-style discipline, not destroy them with divine judgments ([verse 14](../07/14.md)). Alternate translation: [And you, my Lord Yahweh, have said that you will not destroy my descendants if they do wrong but correct them as humans discipline their children!]
7:19	wxos		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	הָ⁠אָדָ֖ם	1	Here the masculine term **man** has a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use language in your translation that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: [human beings]
7:20	flcj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וּ⁠מַה־יּוֹסִ֥יף דָּוִ֛ד ע֖וֹד לְ⁠דַבֵּ֣ר אֵלֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1	David is using the question form to express that he is too overwhelmed to say anything more. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [I find that I am now at a loss for words!]
7:20	q0jp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠אַתָּ֛ה יָדַ֥עְתָּ אֶֽת־עַבְדְּ⁠ךָ֖	1	David is stating the pronoun **you** separately, even though the verb translated as **you know** already includes this meaning. He is doing that in order to contrast Yahweh’s knowledge of what he is thinking and feeling with his own inability to say anything further. If a speaker of your language would use an explicit pronoun for the same purpose, you may want to use that construction in your translation. If not, your language may have other ways of showing the meaning here. Alternate translation: [But for your part, you know your servant]
7:20	t7q8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠אַתָּ֛ה יָדַ֥עְתָּ אֶֽת־עַבְדְּ⁠ךָ֖	1	Here, **your servant** represents what David wants to say. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [But you certainly know what I, your servant, want to say]
7:21	u720		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בַּ⁠עֲב֤וּר דְּבָֽרְ⁠ךָ֙	1	David is using the term **word** to represent what Yahweh said on some previous occasion by using words. In context, he seems to be referring to how Yahweh instructed Samuel in [1 Samuel 16:12](../../1sa/16/12.md) to anoint him as king. This constituted a commitment on Yahweh’s part to make David the king. The idea here seems to be that in order to keep this promise in the fullest sense, Yahweh is going to make David the head of a royal dynasty. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [In order to keep your promise in the fullest sense]
7:21	r29k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּֽ⁠כְ⁠לִבְּ⁠ךָ֔	1	Here, the **heart** represents a person’s desires. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [according to your desire] or [because you wanted to]
7:21	lbol		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	אֵ֥ת כָּל־הַ⁠גְּדוּלָּ֖ה הַ⁠זֹּ֑את	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **greatness**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [all these great things]
7:21	dqn9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	לְ⁠הוֹדִ֖יעַ אֶת־עַבְדֶּֽ⁠ךָ	1	In this context, the verb form **to make … know** does not describe the purpose of the preceding action **you have done all this greatness**. Instead, it describes an accompanying action. Use an appropriate verbal form in your language to convey this meaning. Alternate translation: [and you have made me, your servant, know this]
7:22	mwyb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	עַל־כֵּ֥ן	1	David is not saying that the reason why Yahweh is **great** is that he has done the great things for him that he describes in the previous verse. David means that he is able to declare confidently to Yahweh **you are great** because he has personally experienced his greatness and goodness in these ways. If this would not be clear, you may want to use a different connecting word or phrase to show how this statement relates to what comes before it. It may be possible to make the relationship clear without using any connecting word or phrase. The UST models one way to do that. Alternate translation: [As a result, I can confidently declare]
7:22	qpez		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	כִּֽי	1	Here the word **for** provides not a reason but an explanation. Alternate translation: [and after all]
7:22	ags6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	אֵ֣ין כָּמ֗וֹ⁠ךָ וְ⁠אֵ֤ין אֱלֹהִים֙ זֽוּלָתֶ֔⁠ךָ	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. It may be clearer in your language to connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: [no god is like you, indeed, you are the only God]
7:22	mio4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	בְּ⁠כֹ֥ל אֲשֶׁר־שָׁמַ֖עְנוּ בְּ⁠אָזְנֵֽי⁠נוּ	1	It might seem that in this context, the expression **with our ears** contains extra information that would not be natural to express in your language. If so, you could leave it out. Alternate translation: [in all that we have heard]
7:23	lg0d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וּ⁠מִ֤י כְ⁠עַמְּ⁠ךָ֙ & וֵ⁠אלֹהָֽי⁠ו	1	David is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [And there is no other nation like your people … and its gods!]
7:23	avv1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	כְ⁠עַמְּ⁠ךָ֙ כְּ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל	1	The terms **like your people** and **like Israel** mean similar things. David is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: [is like your people Israel]
7:23	t02d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הָלְכֽוּ	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [7:3](../07/03.md). Alternate translation: [took action]

7:23	utow		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	הַ⁠גְּדוּלָּ֤ה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **greatness**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [great things]
7:23	thzu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	לָ⁠כֶ֜ם	1	The word **you** is plural here because it refers to the Israelites, so use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction. Alternate translation: [for you, O Israel] or [for them]
7:23	dvsc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-aside	לָ⁠כֶ֜ם	1	David has been addressing Yahweh in his prayer, but now he briefly addresses the nation of Israel (as **you**), even though he knows that the people of this nation cannot hear him. (David has gone to the sacred tent to speak with Yahweh alone, as [verse 18](../07/18.md) indicates.) He does this in order to express more powerfully his feelings about the **greatness** (great things) that Yahweh has done for Israel. You may be able to use punctuation or some other convention of your language to show that the addressee changes briefly here. You might also use a first-person plural pronoun to show that by **you** (plural), David is referring to the people group to which he belongs, not to Yahweh, to whom the singular forms of “you” refer in the rest of the verse. Alternate translation: [for us]
7:23	d1sq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠נֹֽרָאוֹת֙	1	The expression **being feared** is a passive verbal form. If your language would not use that form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [and fearsome things]
7:23	dl95		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	לְ⁠אַרְצֶ֔⁠ךָ	1	The word **your** is singular here because it refers to Yahweh. So use the singular form in your translation if your language marks that distinction. Alternate translation: [for your land, O Yahweh]
7:23	lc5w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִ⁠פְּנֵ֣י	1	Here, **from the face of** means “in front of,” with the implication that Yahweh did these fearsome things to defeat the enemies who were confronting the Israelites and opposing them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [in front of] or [against the nations that opposed]
7:23	hxbo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	גּוֹיִ֖ם וֵ⁠אלֹהָֽי⁠ו	1	David is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: [and from other enemy nations and the gods of each one]
7:25	ha5y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וְ⁠עַתָּה֙	1	**And now** was an expression that speakers in this culture commonly used to introduce their main topic. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. You could also use plain language. See how you translated the similar expression in [2:6](../02/06.md).
7:25	y9pl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הַ⁠דָּבָ֗ר אֲשֶׁ֨ר דִּבַּ֤רְתָּ	1	David is using the term **word** to represent what God said by using words. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [the things that you have said]

The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. It may be clearer in your language to connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: [raise up to forever, indeed, fulfill what you have promised]
7:25	w5kp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הָקֵ֖ם	1	David is speaking as if Yahweh’s **word** were an object that Yahweh could physically **raise up** or lift into a high position. He means that he wants Yahweh to fulfill the promise that he has made. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. If you have already translated the book of 1 Samuel, see how you translated the similar expressions in [1 Samuel 1:23](../../1sa/01/23.md), [1 Samuel 3:12](../../1sa/03/12.md), and [1 Samuel 15:11](../../1sa/15/11.md). Alternate translation: [perform] or [fulfill]
7:26	j25v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	שִׁמְ⁠ךָ֤	1	Here, **name** represents “reputation.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [your reputation]

Alternate translation: [as people say that you, Yahweh of Armies, are God over Israel]
7:26	ub4o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	לֵ⁠אמֹ֔ר	1	The term **saying** introduces a direct quotation. In your translation, use a natural way of introducing direct quotations in your language. (In some languages, it may not be necessary to represent this term explicitly.) Alternate translation: [so that people will say]
7:26	chih		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וּ⁠בֵית֙ עַבְדְּ⁠ךָ֣ דָוִ֔ד יִהְיֶ֥ה נָכ֖וֹן	1	The expression **will be established** is a passive verbal form.

Alternate translation: [and you will establish the house of your servant David]
7:26	jzjq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וּ⁠בֵית֙	1	See how you translated the similar expression in the previous verse. Alternate translation: [and the dynasty of]
7:26	l7bl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	לְ⁠פָנֶֽי⁠ךָ	1	This could mean: (1) that David is using one part of Yahweh, his **face**, to mean all of him in the act of maintaining the rule of David and his descendants. The idea is that Yahweh would be watching them and protecting them. Alternate translation: [as you maintain it]; (2) that David is using Yahweh’s **face** to represent his presence. Alternate translation: [in your presence]
7:27	ouc9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	כִּֽי	1	Here the word **For** provides not a reason but an explanation. Alternate translation: [After all]
7:27	misw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	גָּלִ֜יתָה אֶת־אֹ֤זֶן עַבְדְּ⁠ךָ֙	1	David is using a common expression, **You have uncovered the ear**, that described one person telling something to another person. If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [You have told this to your servant] or [You have told this to me]
7:27	aq7p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	לֵ⁠אמֹ֔ר בַּ֖יִת אֶבְנֶה־לָּ֑⁠ךְ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: [saying that you will build a house for me]
7:27	fe4o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מָצָ֤א עַבְדְּ⁠ךָ֙ אֶת־לִבּ֔⁠וֹ	1	David is using **found his heart** as a common expression of his culture to mean “found courage” or “became brave enough.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning, or you could state the meaning plainly.

7:28	ujzl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	אַתָּה־הוּא֙ הָֽ⁠אֱלֹהִ֔ים	1	It might seem that the expression **you {are} he, the God** contains extra information that would not be natural to express in your language. If so, you could shorten it. Alternate translation: [you are God]
7:28	ufjn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אַתָּה־הוּא֙ הָֽ⁠אֱלֹהִ֔ים	1	The implication is that Yahweh is the only true God. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [you are the only true God]
7:28	jeoa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וּ⁠דְבָרֶ֖י⁠ךָ יִהְי֣וּ אֱמֶ֑ת	1	David is using the term **words** to represent what Yahweh says by using words.

7:28	jo54		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	אֶת־הַ⁠טּוֹבָ֖ה הַ⁠זֹּֽאת	1	David is using the adjective **good** as a noun to mean a certain kind of thing.

8:intro	hc4j				0	# 2 Samuel 8 Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the story of what David did as the king of Israel. It describes how he defeated the enemy nations that surrounded Israel and took great plunder from them, bringing safety and prosperity to the Israelites. It then gives some details of his government administration.\n\nIf you chose to present the lists in [3:2–5](../03/02.md) and [5:13–16](../05/13.md) as the lists would appear in your culture, you should present the list in [8:15–18](../08/15.md) in the same way. For example, you might put [verse 15](../08/15.md) on a separate line as a summary of David’s government. You might then put the name of each official on a separate line, like this:\nAnd David was king over all of Israel. And it happened, David did justice and righteousness for all of his people.\nJoab, the son of Zeruiah, was over the army\nJehoshapat, the son of Ahilud, was the recorder.\nZadok, the son of Ahitub, and Ahimelech, the son of Abiathar, were priests\nSeraiah was the scribe.\nBenaiah, the son of Jehoiada, was over both the Kerethites and the Pelethites.\nThe sons of David were priests.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Numbers\n\nThere are large numbers in [verses 4](../08/04.md), [5](../08/05.md), and [13](../08/13.md). Decide how you will represent large numbers in your translation.\n\n### “struck”\n\nIn several places in this chapter, the author says that David “struck” an opposing army. He means that David and his army defeated those opponents in battle.\n\n### “to restore his hand at the River”\n\nIn [8:3](../08/03.md), the author says that Hadadezer, the ruler of the Syrian kingdom of Zobah, “went to restore his hand at the River.” Interpreters understand this expression in two main ways. (1) It could mean that Hadadezer led his army against the Israelites in order to ensure that he continued to control his own territory. The kingdom of Zobah lay between the Euphrates River on the east and Israel on the west. Hadadezer may have seen how David had conquered and subdued the Philistines and Moabites, and he may have launched a pre-emptive attack to keep David from conquering him as well. The author may be saying that Hadadezer felt that his authority and control over his territory (his “hand”) had been diminished by David’s military successes against other nations, and so he marched his army out to “restore” it. If you follow this interpretation, you might say in your translation that Hadadezer went out “to reassert his control over his territory, from its border with Israel all the way to the Euphrates River.” (2) The expression could also mean that Hadadezer had built a monument to himself at the Euphrates River, asserting his control over the territory west of the river, and that he led his army out to “restore” the monument in order to reassert that control. The term “hand” means “monument” in [1 Samuel 15:12](../../1sa/15/12.md), and that could also be the meaning here. However, in this interpretation Hadadezer and his army would have been marching away from Israel and would not necessarily have come into conflict with David. The further implication would have to be that David learned of this action by a hostile king to reassert control over his territory, and so he led the Israelite army against him to subdue him. If you follow this interpretation, you might say in your translation that Hadadezer went “to repair his monument at the Euphrates River.”\n\n## Textual Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Betah\n\nIn [8:8](../08/08.md), the author refers to a city by the name of **Betah**. However, in the parallel passage in [1 Chronicles 18:8](../../1ch/18/08.md), it is called Tibhath. It appears possible that at some point in the process of transmission, scribes transposed two of the letters in this name. However, this is not certain, and it is not clear which may have been the original form, so we do not recommend that you change the name either here or in 1 Chronicles so that it is the same in both places. Instead, if it would be helpful to your readers, you may wish to note the difference in a footnote.

8:1	ubox		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	דָּוִ֛ד	1	Here and frequently in this chapter, the author uses **David**, one person who was involved in these actions, to represent everyone who was involved. See how you translated the similar expression in [3:1](../03/01.md), where “David” means “David and his supporters.” Alternate translation: [David and his army]
8:1	q0p7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	אֶת־מֶ֥תֶג הָ⁠אַמָּ֖ה	1	The expression **Metheg Ammah** seems to be a description rather than the name of a place. No place is known by that name. The parallel passage in [1 Chronicles 18:1](../../1ch/18/01.md) says that David captured the city of Gath and its surrounding towns. **Metheg Ammah** means “the bridle of the mother city.” Gath was the capital city of the Philistine confederation, and the author may speak of it here as a “bridle” to mean that conquering it gave David the means to control the entire Philistine confederation. (The word “bridle” could also indicate that previously the Philistines had exercised control over the Israelites from their capital city of Gath.) In your translation, you may wish to represent the expression “Metheg Ammah” and spell it the way it sounds in your language. Alternatively, you could express the probable meaning and translate the expression as a reference to Gath. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to take the approach that it takes. Alternate translation: [Gath, their capital city]

He killed those who were lying under the first two parts but let those under the third part live. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [He used a rope divided into three equal parts. He stretched it out and killed the soldiers lying under the first two parts, but he let the soldiers lying under the rest of the rope live]
8:2	uuh9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	אֶת־מוֹאָ֗ב	1	In this verse, the word **Moab** is singular in form, but it refers to all the Moabite people as a group.

8:2	gf8y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	נֹשְׂאֵ֥י מִנְחָֽה	1	The author is using the first thing that subject peoples would do to deliver tribute, lift it onto the backs of animals that would transport it, to represent the entire action of paying tribute.

8:3	x0d7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	בְּ⁠לֶכְתּ֕⁠וֹ	1	The pronoun **he** refers to Hadadezer. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: [when Hadadezer went]

At one point in the process of transmission, scribes may have accidentally left out the word “chariots,” and the letters or points that indicated numbers may also have been unintentionally altered.

Alternate translation: [And after choosing 100 horses from the chariots, David had his soldiers hamstring the rest]
8:4	c4ch		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	וַ⁠יְעַקֵּ֤ר דָּוִד֙ אֶת־כָּל־הָ⁠רֶ֔כֶב	1	When the author says that David **hamstrung** these horses, he meant that he had his soldiers use a method of disabling them by cutting tendons in their legs. This would be done carefully so that horses would still be able to walk and carry loads, but they would no longer be able to run. As a result, they could no longer be used in warfare. If your readers would not be familiar with what hamstringing is, you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: [And David had his soldiers disable all of the chariot horses by cutting their leg tendons]
8:5	b28b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֲרַ֣ם דַּמֶּ֔שֶׂק	1	Here, **Aram of Damascus** represents the army of the Aramean kingdom whose capital was Damascus.

It could be a general term for military equipment whose meaning must be understood from the context. In some contexts, such as [Jeremiah 51:11](../../jer/51/11.md), it seems to mean “quivers” or arrow-cases, and some versions also translate it that way here. However, the context seems to support the meaning of **shields**. Some ancient rulers had their bodyguard carry shields that were plated with precious metals, and Hadadezer may have done that. Alternate translation: [the gold-plated shields that Hadadezer’s bodyguard had carried]
8:8	yrcr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	לָקַ֞ח & נְחֹ֖שֶׁת הַרְבֵּ֥ה מְאֹֽד	1	The phrase **took bronze, making very much** expresses a single idea.

In this context, the author is probably using the term **priests** to mean high-ranking royal officials. The parallel passage in [1 Chronicles 18:17](../../1ch/18/17.md) says that they were “chief officials,” suggesting that that is the meaning here. Alternate translation: [and the sons of David were chief officials]
9:intro	lwh6				0	# 2 Samuel 9 Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the story of what David did as the king of Israel. It describes how David honored his promise to Jonathan by providing for his son Mephibosheth.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Since Saul was dead, how could he still have had a servant?\n\nThe author says in [9:2](../09/02.md) that the “house of Saul” had a servant named Ziba. The Law of Moses said that if an Israelite had a servant who was not an Israelite, that servant would remain the property of the Israelite’s family after he died. So it appears that Ziba was not an Israelite and that he had stayed on in his role as the steward of Saul’s property in Gibeah of Benjamin even after Saul died and even though Saul’s only surviving son Ishbosheth had fled across the Jordan River to Mahanaim. As the story in this chapter makes clear, Saul had other descendants, including his grandson Mephibosheth, so Ziba, his sons, and his servants had an obligation to maintain the family property for their benefit. In [9:11](../09/11.md), Ziba pledges to David that he will do this for Mephibosheth.
9:1	v4e6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לְ⁠בֵ֣ית שָׁא֑וּל	1	The author is using the term **house** by association to mean all the people descended from a particular person. It envisions them as if they were one household living together. So **the house of Saul** figuratively means all the people descended from King Saul. (This is slightly different from the uses of this phrase in [chapter 3](../03/01.md) to mean “the supporters of Saul” or “the successors of Saul.”) Alternate translation: [among the descendants of Saul]

9:3	n467		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	אִישׁ֙	1	Here the masculine term **a man** has a generic sense that includes both men and women.

9:3	wnt0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	חֶ֣סֶד אֱלֹהִ֑ים	1	David is using the possessive form **the covenant faithfulness of God** to mean the covenant faithfulness that he will show to such a person because of the oath he swore to God. He does not mean God’s own covenant faithfulness. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: [the covenant faithfulness that I swore to God I would do]
9:4	tjev		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הִנֵּה	1	Ziba is using the term **behold** to focus his listeners’ attention on what he is about to say. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: [I will tell you]

He knelt down in front of David, pressing his face to the ground and stretching himself out completely, as a gesture to honor David. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action.

10:intro	abca				0	# 2 Samuel 10 Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the story of what David did as the king of Israel. It describes how David tried to express sympathy to the new king of the Ammonites for the death of his father but was instead insulted and rebuffed. It describes how the Ammonites, knowing they had offended David, hired Aramean mercenaries to help them fight Israel and how Joab and his brother Abishai, David’s generals, defeated those armies. Finally, it describes how the Arameans gathered an even larger army and how David led the entire army of Israel to defeat them.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Why did Hanun shave half of the beards of David’s messengers and cut their garments in the middle?\n\nIn [10:4](../10/04.md), to insult David’s messengers, the Ammonite king, Hanun, has his servants shave off half of their beards and cut off half of their robes. In just about any context, these actions would have made the men look foolish and exposed them to shame and embarrassment. But in this culture, there may have been a further significance. In this culture, men wore beards, while women did not have them. By leaving the messengers with half-beards, Hanun was symbolically making them neither men nor women. Humans wear clothes, while animals do not. By leaving the messengers with half-robes, Hanun was symbolically making them neither human nor animal. So this was a way of making the messengers symbolically non-existent. Since they represented David personally, it was a way of insulting David by telling him, “You are nothing.” The author of this book does not explain the significance of this action, since his readers would already have understood it. But if it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain it in a footnote.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Numbers\n\nThere are large numbers in [verses 6](../10/06.md) and [18](../10/18.md). Translate these according to the decision you made for [chapter 8](../08/01.md) about how you would represent large numbers in your translation.

So does the Septuagint, an ancient Greek translation. (It is possible that here in 2 Samuel and in that passage in 1 Chronicles the biblical author is mentioning one kind of soldier in order to mean soldiers in general. The UST models one way to express that meaning, which would be the same in both cases.) If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.

11:intro	abcb				0	# 2 Samuel 11 Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the story of what David did as the king of Israel. However, it marks a turning point in his life. David commits two very serious sins, adultery and murder. For the rest of his life, David experienced the consequences of these sins as his children committed sexual violence and murder against one another and as one of his sons rebelled against him to try to replace him as king.\n\nThis chapter describes specifically how David saw a beautiful woman, Bathsheba, and required her have sexual relations with him. When she became pregnant, David brought her husband Uriah home from fighting against the Ammonites. David encouraged him to relax at home with his wife so it would appear as if he was the father of the child. But Uriah remained on duty, staying with the palace guards. So David arranged with his general Joab to have Uriah killed in battle. He then married Bathsheba. The author concludes this account by noting that “the thing that David had done was bad in the eyes of Yahweh.” David begins to experience the consequences in the following chapter.

11:1	ekgn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לְ⁠עֵ֣ת ׀ צֵ֣את הַ⁠מַּלְאֿכִ֗ים	1	The author says **going out** as a common expression that meant “going to war.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning, or you could state the meaning plainly.

11:2	om9l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לְ⁠עֵ֣ת הָ⁠עֶ֗רֶב	1	This culture considered the **evening** to begin once the day had become cooler. Some cultures would describe that time as “late afternoon” rather than evening. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could describe what the author means here. Alternate translation: [after the hottest part of the day]
11:2	c4xl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	בֵּית־הַ⁠מֶּ֔לֶךְ	1	Since David is the subject of this sentence, it may be more natural in your language to refer to his **house** or palace with a pronoun. Alternate translation: [his house] or [his palace]

11:4	hvhf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וְ⁠הִ֥יא מִתְקַדֶּ֖שֶׁת מִ⁠טֻּמְאָתָ֑⁠הּ	1	The author is providing background information to help readers understand what happens next in the story. He is explaining that Bathsheba had been washing herself in order to restore ceremonial cleanness at the end of the seven-day period of uncleanness that followed her monthly period. This meant that she was at the time in her monthly cycle when she could conceive a child when David had sexual relations with her. In your translation, introduce this background information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
11:5	tzzc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠תֹּ֖אמֶר	1	The author is using Bathsheba (referring to her with the pronoun **she**) to represent the person she **sent** to give this message to David.

His palace was on the highest mountain in Jerusalem, so Uriah would have to go **down** from there to get to his **house**. If this expression contains extra information that would not be natural to express in your language, you could shorten it. Alternate translation: [Go]
11:8	alvi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וּ⁠רְחַ֣ץ רַגְלֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1	In this culture, people wore sandals or went barefoot, and so their feet became dirty during work and travel. They would wash their feet when they returned home for the day and intended to do no further work or traveling. When David tells Uriah **wash your feet**, the implication is that he should consider himself to be finished with his military mission of bringing news from the battlefield. You could indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [and consider yourself to be off duty]

11:19	osn5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	אֵ֛ת כָּל־דִּבְרֵ֥י הַ⁠מִּלְחָמָ֖ה	1	Joab is saying **all of the things of the battle** as a generalization. Since Joab expects that the messenger will not initially tell David that Uriah has been killed, the word **all** might not be appropriate in your language.

11:21	ht2k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	יְרֻבֶּ֗שֶׁת	1	**Jerubbesheth** is another name for the person who is called Jerubbaal in the book of Judges. (That was a second name that people gave to Gideon.) Here in this book, either the original author or later scribes did not want to reproduce the name “Baal,” since that was the name of a foreign god whom the Israelites detested. So the author or scribes replaced “baal” with “besheth,” a Hebrew word that means “shame.” We recommend that you use the name **Jerubbesheth** in your translation to reflect this. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain in a footnote that this is the same person known as Jerubbaal or Gideon in Judges.

This is a shorter version of the usual introductory phrase. More typically he would write, “And the messenger spoke to David, saying.” This shorter form suggests the haste with which the messenger gave this report, fearing that David would become angry. Your language may have a way of introducing quotations that would similarly suggest this. Some languages may not need to use any introductory term. Alternate translation: [And the messenger told David, “The men]
11:23	ax5d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	גָבְר֤וּ עָלֵ֨י⁠נוּ֙ הָֽ⁠אֲנָשִׁ֔ים	1	The messenger is using **the men became strong against us** as a common expression of his culture to mean that the Ammonites organized a force to attack the Israelites.

12:intro	abcc				0	# 2 Samuel 12 Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the story of what David did as the king of Israel. It describes how Yahweh began to make David experienced the consequences of his sins of adultery and murder. Yahweh sent the prophet Nathan to David to get him to acknowledge and confess these sins. Nathan told a story that enabled David to recognize how wrong his actions had been. David confessed his sin, and Nathan told him that Yahweh had forgiven him, but nevertheless there would be consequences. The child whom David had fathered would die, and there would be perpetual violence within David’s family. David fasted and prayed in the hopes that Yahweh would spare the child, but the child died. David showed that he respected Yahweh’s will by ending his fast and going to worship Yahweh. Later, David and Bathsheba had another child, one whom Yahweh welcomed. David also participated in the final conquest of the Ammonite capital city of Rabbah.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\nIn [verses 7–12](../12/07.md), where Nathan gives David a message from Yahweh, there is a long quotation within a quotation. The entire message is something that Nathan said that the author is quoting, so that is a first-level quotation. But within this message, Nathan tells David what Yahweh has said, so that is a quotation within a quotation, or a second-level quotation. Your language may use quotation marks or some other punctuation or convention to indicate various levels of quotation. The ULT and UST models ways to do that. You could also translate the whole message in such a way that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Notes suggest how you might do that.\n\n## Textual Issues in This Chapter\n\n### “the enemies of Yahweh” ([12:14](../12/14.md))\n\nIn [12:14](../12/14.md), Nathan tells David that he has utterly spurned “the enemies of Yahweh.” The Septuagint (an ancient Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible) and three of the Dead Sea Scrolls (ancient manuscripts that are independent of the traditional Hebrew text) do not have the expression “the enemies of.” Some interpreters suggest that out of respect for David, in order to avoid saying that he had utterly spurned Yahweh, later scribes may have substituted the phrase about Yahweh’s enemies for a direct reference to Yahweh himself. Scribes may have done similar things in other places. (For example, if you have already translated the book of 1 Samuel, see how you translated the expression in [1 Samuel 20:16](../../1sa/20/16.md) about “the enemies of David.”) Another possibility is that the word translated as “spurned” has a meaning here that it does not have in other places. Here it might mean that David has given the enemies of Yahweh occasion to blaspheme him, that is, to say that worshiping Yahweh does not make someone a better person. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
12:1	y7kd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables	וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר ל⁠וֹ֙	1	To help David understand what Yahweh has sent him to say, Nathan tells David a story as if it were true. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: [and to help him understand what Yahweh had sent him to say, he told him a story as if it were true. He said to him]
12:1	dkno		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	אֶחָ֥ד עָשִׁ֖יר וְ⁠אֶחָ֥ד רָֽאשׁ	1	Nathan is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: [One man was rich, and the other one was poor]
12:2	x7bk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	לְ⁠עָשִׁ֗יר	1	The author is using the adjective **rich** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. The ULT indicates this by adding the word **one**. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this adjective with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: [To the rich man]
12:3	pcs6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	כִּבְשָׂ֨ה אַחַ֤ת קְטַנָּה֙	1	A **ewe** is a female sheep. If your readers would not be familiar with what a ewe is, you could use the name of a similar thing that your readers would recognize, or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: [a young female sheep]
12:3	ww7p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	מִ⁠פִּתּ֨⁠וֹ	1	The author is not referring to a specific **morsel**. He means portions of food in general. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use an expression that would be more natural in your language. Alternate translation: [scraps of food that he gave it]
12:4	zs5o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הֵלֶךְ֮ & לָ⁠אֹרֵ֖חַ הַ⁠בָּא־ל֑⁠וֹ	1	Nathan uses two different terms to describe the rich man’s guest. The first term, **traveler**, simply refers to someone who is on a journey. The second term, **wayfarer**, refers in this context to a traveler whom someone has taken into his home as a guest. If your language has separate words or phrases that express these ideas, it would be appropriate to use them in your translation. Alternate translation: [a man who was on a journey … his guest]

12:5	psuv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בֶן־מָ֔וֶת	1	In certain contexts, biblical authors and characters use the expression **son of** to indicate that a person has the characteristic of something. In this case, David is saying that the rich man has the characteristic of **death**, in the sense that David feels he deserves to die for what he did. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. If you have already translated the book of 1 Samuel, see how you translated the similar expression in [1 Samuel 26:16](../../1sa/26/16.md). Alternate translation: [deserves to die]

If it would be helpful your language, you may wish to relate these events in the order in which they happened, as in the UST. Alternate translation: [because he did not spare but instead did this thing]
12:6	b98d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לֹֽא־חָמָֽל	1	David is using the same term, **spare**, that Nathan used in his story. Nathan said that the rich man spared all of the animals in his flock and herd from being butchered, while David means that the rich man did not spare the poor man, that is, he had no pity on him but cruelly took his lamb and butchered it. Your language may have a term that you can use meaningfully in both places in your translation. If not, be sure that the meaning of **spare** in this verse is clear. Alternate translation: [he had no pity on the poor man]
12:7	i9u2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אַתָּ֣ה הָ⁠אִ֑ישׁ	1	Nathan is speaking as if David actually were **the man** in his story.

13:intro	abcd				0	# 2 Samuel 13 Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the story of what David did as the king of Israel. The prophet Nathan had told him that as a consequence of his sins of adultery and murder, there would be perpetual violence within his family. This chapter tells how that violence began. David’s oldest son Amnon committed sexual violence against one of David’s daughters, Amnon’s half-sister Tamar. Another of David’s sons, Absalom, Tamar’s full brother, then murdered Amnon for revenge and fled to another country.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### “keep silent, he is your brother”\n\nWhen Absalom learned that his half-brother Amnon had raped his sister Tamar, he told Tamar, “keep silent, he is your brother.” Absalom did not mean that women should say nothing about sexual violence when it is committed by a family member. The Bible warns that sexual violence is a serious sin, and it forbids sexual relations between close family members. So what Absalom says here should not be taken as approval of either of those things. Instead, as the rest of the story indicates, Absalom wanted to pretend that he was not going to try to get revenge against Amnon. That way Amnon would be unsuspecting, and Absalom would be able to murder him. The author describes in [13:23–29](../13/23.md) how he did that. Absalom needed Tamar not to make Amnon’s crime public. The reason he gave Tamar, “he is your brother,” may have been intended to suggest to her that making the crime public would have brought shame to the whole family. To carry out his own treacherous murder plot, Absalom appealed to Tamar’s wish for her family to have a good reputation, and in the process, he left her feeling shame for the rest of her life.\n\n### Why did Absalom flee to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur?\n\nThe author reports in [13:37](../13/37.md) that after he murdered Amnon, Absalom fled to Talmai, the son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur. The author records in [3:3](../03/03.md) that Absalom was “the son of Maacah, the daughter of Talmai, the king of Geshur.” So Talmai was Absalom’s grandfather, his mother’s father. In many cultures in which a woman goes to live with her husband’s family when she marries, a person in trouble can flee for safety back to where his mother’s family lives. That is what Absalom did. You may have some way of indicating this naturally in your translation, in the text or in a footnote, particularly if your readers would be familiar with this cultural practice. The UST models one way to do this.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### “brother,” “sister”\n\nFrequently in this chapter, the author and characters refer to someone as the “brother” or “sister” of someone who has the same father but not the same mother. Your language may have its own term or expression for this relationship, such as “half-brother” and “half-sister.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship]])

13:11	e53r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֲחוֹתִֽ⁠י	1	In this context, Amnon may be using the word **sister** not to describe a kinship relationship but as a term of endearment, as in [Song of Songs 4:9](../../sng/04/09.md) and several other places in that book. Your language may have a comparable term that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: [my darling]

She is doing that because she is comparing the situations that she and Amnon would each be in. If a speaker of your language would use explicit pronouns for the same purpose, you may want to use that construction in your translation. If not, your language may have other ways of showing that Tamar is comparing these situations. It may not be necessary to represent the separately stated pronouns explicitly.

If not, you can translate this adjective with an equivalent phrase. Amnon is being hostile and dismissive toward the woman he previously admired but whom he now detests because of his own guilt. Use an expression in your translation that reflects this. The UST models one way to do that.

14:intro	abce				0	# 2 Samuel 14 Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the story of what David did as the king of Israel. It describes how Joab got a woman to go to David and tell him a story that would provide an illustration that would convince David that he should permit Absalom to return to the city of Jerusalem and not punish him for killing his half-brother Amnon. The chapter also describes Absalom’s appearance and family and how he ruthlessly got Joab to appeal to David to allow him to return to the royal court itself.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### How much did Absalom’s hair weigh?\n\nIn [14:26](../14/26.md), the author says that when Absalom cut his hair each year, it weighed “200 shekels by the stone of the king.” The author is helping readers understand how much Absalom’s hair weighed by expressing the weight in terms of a measurement they know. The “stone of the king” was a standard for the weight of a shekel, but it is no longer certain exactly what this was. If it was the same as the shekel of the sanctuary, Absalom’s hair would have weighed about five pounds or about two kilograms, which seems improbable. Some interpreters suggest that the final version of 2 Samuel was edited during or after the Babylonian exile and that the book is referring to the Babylonian shekel as a standard that readers would recognize. In that case the weight would be about two pounds or about one kilogram, which is more probable. Since the actual weight is uncertain, in your translation, you could use the ancient measurement, “shekels by the stone of the king,” and spell the word “shekel” the way it sounds in your language. You could also use a general expression, as the UST does.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### “my lord the king”\n\nIn several places in this chapter, people who are addressing David directly speak of him in the third person as “the king” or “my lord the king” to show respect. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in a respectful form in the second person.

In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
14:1	b3y5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לֵ֥ב הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ עַל־אַבְשָׁלֽוֹם	1	Here, the **heart** represents a person’s feelings. This could mean: (1) that David felt hostile toward Absalom. That is the meaning in [Daniel 11:28](../../dan/11/28.md), the only other instance of this expression in the Bible. The rest of this chapter shows that David had to be persuaded through an elaborate ruse to allow Absalom to return to Jerusalem, and even then he would not allow him to come into his presence. Alternate translation: [that King David felt hostile toward Absalom]; (2) that David was longing to see Absalom. Many versions follow this interpretation, and you may wish to follow it if a translation of the Bible exists in your region and follows it. Alternate translation: [that King David longed to see Absalom]

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of these actions in the text of your translation or in a footnote. Alternate translation: [and act as if you are grieving by wearing dark clothes and not applying any oil to yourself]
14:2	lbss		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	כְּ⁠אִשָּׁ֗ה זֶ֚ה	1	Joab is not referring to a specific **woman**. He means any woman who had been **mourning many days**.

14:3	xlwg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	וּ⁠בָאת֙	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “go” instead of **come**. Alternate translation: [And you shall go]
14:3	vd3j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	כַּ⁠דָּבָ֣ר הַ⁠זֶּ֑ה	1	Joab is using the term **word** to represent what he is going to say by using words.

She knelt down in front of David, pressing her face **to the ground** as a gesture to honor him. She then **prostrated herself** or stretched out flat on the ground to show David great honor. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action in the text or in a footnote. Alternate translation: [and she knelt on the ground in front of David, stretching herself out flat, to honor him greatly]
14:4	x97n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	הוֹשִׁ֥עָ⁠ה הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ	1	The woman is referring to King David by a respectful title, and she is using the customary expression of this culture to ask him to use his royal power to help her.

Alternate translation: [What is the matter]
14:5	s002		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables	וַ⁠תֹּ֗אמֶר	1	To try to convince David that he should allow Absalom to return, the woman, as instructed by Joab, tells David a story as if it were true.

She said to him]

The woman is clarifying that she is not without the support of a male relative for some other reason, for example, she has not separated from a husband who is still living. Alternate translation: [Since my husband has died, I am truly a widow]
14:5	nz3a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אִשָּֽׁה־אַלְמָנָ֥ה	1	The woman is using **a woman, a widow** as a common expression of her culture to mean “a woman who is a widow.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning, or you could state the meaning plainly.

14:6	x7ns		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	וַ⁠יַּכּ֧⁠וֹ הָ⁠אֶחָ֛ד אֶת־הָ⁠אֶחָ֖ד	1	It might seem that the expression **And the one struck him, the one** contains extra information that would not be natural to express in your language. If so, you could shorten it. Alternate translation: [And one of them struck the other]
14:7	a97m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠הִנֵּה֩	1	The woman is using the term **behold** to call attention to what she is about to say. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. See how you translated the term “behold” in [1:2](../01/02.md).
14:7	gx1i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	קָ֨מָה	1	The woman is using **has arisen** as a common expression of her culture to mean “has taken action.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [has taken action]

14:7	n73l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠נֶ֤פֶשׁ אָחִי⁠ו֙	1	Here, **life** represents “death.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [to avenge the death of his brother]
14:7	rw0g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-aside	וְ⁠נַשְׁמִ֖ידָה גַּ֣ם אֶת־הַ⁠יּוֹרֵ֑שׁ	1	The other members of the clan would not have spoken these words directly to the woman. Since they say **let us**, in her depiction of them, they are pausing to speak confidentially to one another. They are speaking in this way because they are betraying their real motive, which is to get the late husband’s property by killing his sole remaining **heir**. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this explicitly in your translation, ending the second-level direct quotation after **he slew** and beginning a new sentence. Alternate translation: [But their real motive is to destroy the heir also]
14:7	bffo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠כִבּ֗וּ אֶת־גַּֽחַלְתִּ⁠י֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר נִשְׁאָ֔רָה	1	Here, the woman is speaking as if her son were actually a **coal** that could be extinguished.

Alternate translation: [And they would destroy my only remaining son]
14:7	yvhv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	שֵׁ֥ם וּ⁠שְׁאֵרִ֖ית	1	The terms **name** and **remnant** mean similar things. The woman is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: [any survivors]
14:7	a4gu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	שֵׁ֥ם	1	Here, **a name** represents “someone to carry on the family line.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [anyone to carry on his name]

14:8	gvq0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠אֲנִ֖י אֲצַוֶּ֥ה	1	David is stating the pronoun **I** separately, even though the verb translated as **I will command** already includes this meaning. He is doing that because he is making a promise to the woman. If a speaker of your language would use an explicit pronoun for this same purpose, you may want to use that construction in your translation. If not, your language may have other ways of showing that David is making a promise. It may not be necessary to represent the separately stated pronoun explicitly. Alternate translation: [and I promise that I will command]

Alternate translation: [and may you, O king, and your throne]
14:9	x01v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠כִסְא֖⁠וֹ	1	Here, **throne** represents “kingdom.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [and his kingdom]

14:11	awyw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מ⁠הרבית גֹּאֵ֤ל הַ⁠דָּם֙ לְ⁠שַׁחֵ֔ת	1	The implication is that the woman wants the king to protect her son from the avenger of blood who is trying to kill him, since that would increase the number of people who had died.

He is then stating the first part of a condition (“if”) but not the second part (“then”). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explicitly state the second part of this condition. Alternate translation: [I swear by Yahweh that not a single hair from your son will fall to the ground. If he suffers any harm, then may Yahweh punish me severely]

If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. If you have already translated the book of 1 Samuel, see how you translated the same expression in [1 Samuel 14:45](../../1sa/14/45.md).

14:13	h4ey		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	עַ֣ם אֱלֹהִ֑ים	1	Here, **the people of God** represents the Israelite people, who worshiped the one true **God**.

14:13	j28m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	כְּ⁠אָשֵׁ֔ם & הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ	1	The woman is not referring to a specific **guilty** person. She means guilty people in general. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use an expression that would be more natural in your language. Alternate translation: [is like a guilty person]
14:13	pwd9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	אֶֽת־נִדְּחֽ⁠וֹ	1	The expression **his banished one** is a passive verbal form.

14:14	cct7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	כִּי־מ֣וֹת נָמ֔וּת	1	The woman is repeating forms of the verb **die** in order to intensify her expression of the idea that it conveys. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the intensification. Alternate translation: [For we will certainly die]

If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: [and after that we cannot be brought back to life]
14:14	aq14		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	וְ⁠חָשַׁב֙ מַֽחֲשָׁב֔וֹת	1	The woman is using a construction in which a verb and its object come from the same root. You may be able to use the same construction in your language to express the meaning here. Alternatively, your language may have another way of saying this. Alternate translation: [but he makes merciful arrangements]
14:14	g9f7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	לְ⁠בִלְתִּ֛י יִדַּ֥ח מִמֶּ֖⁠נּוּ נִדָּֽח	1	The expressions **the banished** and **will not be banished** are passive verbal forms.

14:15	mzop		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֲמָתֽ⁠וֹ	1	Here and in the next verse, the woman describes herself as a **female servant**, using a different term than the one she had been using, which the ULT translates as “maidservant.” This term refers to a higher-ranking member of the household whose master might feel some sense of obligation toward her. If your language and culture have different terms for female servants of different rank, use the term for a female servant of higher rank here and in the next verse.

14:16	xcqe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מִֽ⁠נַּחֲלַ֖ת אֱלֹהִֽים	1	The woman is speaking of the people of Israel as if they were something that Yahweh had inherited as a lasting possession. She is referring to the Israelites as the people who belong to Yahweh perpetually. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. If you have already translated the book of 1 Samuel, see how you translated the similar expression in [1 Samuel 10:1](../../1sa/10/01.md).

14:17	ewzi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	כֵּ֣ן אֲדֹנִ֤⁠י הַ⁠מֶּ֨לֶךְ֙	1	Since the woman has already referred to David as **my lord the king** once in this sentence, it may be more natural in your language to use a pronoun in this second instance. Alternate translation: [so is he]
14:17	wz1j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing	וַֽ⁠יהוָ֥ה אֱלֹהֶ֖י⁠ךָ יְהִ֥י עִמָּֽ⁠ךְ	1	The woman is asking God to bless King David.

She is then stating the first part of a condition (“if”) but not the second part (“then”). Use a natural way in your language to express an oath. In a context such as this, it may be natural to express just the first part of the condition as a negative statement. Alternate translation: [I swear by the life of your soul, my lord the king, that there is no turning to the right or turning to the left from all that my lord the king has spoken]
14:19	yufi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	חֵֽי־נַפְשְׁ⁠ךָ֩	1	The woman is using **your soul** to represent David himself. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [Your life]

14:19	dbaf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לְ⁠הֵמִ֣ין וּ⁠לְ⁠הַשְׂמִ֗יל מִ⁠כֹּ֤ל	1	Here, the woman is speaking of agreeing completely with the king’s words as if that were staying on a straight path and not **turning to the right or turning to the left**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [contradicting anything]
14:19	dsu3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	כִּֽי	1	Here the word **For** provides not a reason but a further explanation. Alternate translation: [In fact,]
14:19	pz0o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ה֣וּא צִוָּ֔⁠נִי וְ⁠ה֗וּא שָׂ֚ם	1	The woman is stating the pronoun **he** separately in both of these instances, even though the verbs translated as **he commanded** and **he put** already include this meaning. She is doing that to confirm Joab’s personal role in these actions. If a speaker of your language would use explicit pronouns for this same purpose, you may want to use that construction in your translation. If not, your language may have other ways of showing that the woman is confirming Joab’s personal role. It may not be necessary to represent the separately stated pronouns explicitly. Alternate translation: [he was the one who commanded me, and he was the one who put]
14:19	i0yz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	שָׂ֚ם בְּ⁠פִ֣י שִׁפְחָֽתְ⁠ךָ֔ אֵ֥ת כָּל־הַ⁠דְּבָרִ֖ים הָ⁠אֵֽלֶּה	1	Here, the woman is speaking as if words were actually objects that could be **put** in the **mouth** of a person.

This could mean: (1) that Joab wanted to change the situation so that Absalom could come home. Alternate translation: [In order to help Absalom come home from banishment, your servant Joab sent me to speak with you]; (2) that Joab told the woman to pretend to be a widow in order to make her appeal to David for Absalom appear to be an appeal for a son of her own. Alternate translation: [So that you would not realize I was talking about Absalom, your servant Joab told me to pretend I was talking about my own situation]
14:20	ikca		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	לָ⁠דַ֖עַת אֶֽת־כָּל־אֲשֶׁ֥ר בָּ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	The woman is making an overstatement for emphasis.

Alternate translation: [since you clearly know what is happening in the land]; (2) that David knows everything that is happening on earth. Alternate translation: [as if you knew everything that was happening on earth]
14:21	pyd3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר הַ⁠מֶּ֨לֶךְ֙ אֶל־יוֹאָ֔ב	1	Joab was clearly not present when the woman was speaking with David, since David had to ask her whether Joab had sent her to him. David must first have summoned Joab and then spoken to him as this verse describes. It may be appropriate in your language to reintroduce Joab as a participant in the story here. Alternate translation: [And the king summoned Joab and said to him]

14:22	nott		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing	וַ⁠יְבָ֣רֶךְ אֶת־הַ⁠מֶּ֑לֶךְ	1	The author does not mean that Joab gave David his blessing, since an inferior does not bless a superior. He means that Joab wished that Yahweh would bless David for agreeing that Absalom could return. In your translation, you may wish to represent what Joab may have said as a direct quotation. Alternate translation: [and he said, “May Yahweh bless you, O king!”]

This verse describes Absalom’s outstanding physical appearance, which helps explain his popularity among the people and sets up his ability to gain followers later in the narrative. In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.

Alternate translation: [At the end of years to years he would shave, because it was heavy on him, so he would shave it. And when he shaved his head and weighed the hair of his head, it weighed 200 shekels by the stone of the king]
14:26	gdz2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מִ⁠קֵּ֨ץ יָמִ֤ים ׀ לַ⁠יָּמִים֙	1	The author is using **at the end of years to years** as a common expression of his culture to mean “at the end of each year.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [at the end of each year]

15:intro	abcf				0	# 2 Samuel 15 Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the story of what David did as the king of Israel. It describes how Absalom got the Israelites to want him to be the king instead of David. It tells how Absalom then proclaimed that he was king and how David and his supporters had to flee from Jerusalem for safety. It describes how Ittai the Gittite, a great soldier, promised to stay with David. It tells how the high priests Zadok and Abiathar wanted to come with David and bring the Box of Yahweh, but he sent them back to Jerusalem with it. And it describes how David also sent his counselor Hushai the Archite back to Jerusalem to pretend he was loyal to Absalom but to try to confuse him instead.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### “your servant”\n\nIn several places in this chapter, people speak of themselves to authorities in the third person as **your servant** to show humility. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in a humble form in the first person.\n\n## Textual Variants in This Chapter\n\n### Did Absalom spend four years or 40 years becoming popular among the Israelites?\n\nAccording to the traditional Hebrew text, Absalom asked David for permission to go to Hebron after he had been back in Jerusalem for “40 years.” The ULT follows that reading. Other ancient versions and authorities read “four years.” The UST follows that reading, which makes sense, because there would not have been time for Absalom to have been trying to win the affections of the Israelites for 40 years. Absalom was born after David became king in Hebron, and David’s entire reign lasted only a little over 40 years. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.

16:intro	abcg				0	# 2 Samuel 16 Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the story of what David did as the king of Israel and specifically how he resisted Absalom’s attempt to replace him as king. It tells how Ziba, Saul’s servant who was helping to provide for Mephibosheth, brought David food to sustain him and the people with him in the wilderness. It tells how a Benjaminite man named Shimei cursed David and threw stones at him as David walked through the area where Shimei lived. It tells how Hushai the Archite got Absalom to accept him as a counselor. It then tells how Ahithophel, Absalom’s other counselor, advised him to have sexual relations with the concubines David had left in Jerusalem. \n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Why did Ahithophel tell Absalom to have sexual relations with David’s concubines?\n\nOne reason why Ahithophel told Absalom to do this was to make a complete break with David so that his followers would fight desperately. Ahithophel says this himself in [16:21](../16/21.md). However, a further reason may have been that having sexual relations with a former king’s concubines would be a symbolic assertion that Absalom was now the king instead. This seems to be the background in [3:7](../03/07.md) and later in [1 Kings 2:22](../../1ki/02/22.md).\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### “the people”\n\nIn the story of Absalom’s rebellion against David, the author and characters use the term “people” in various contexts to mean either the crowd of supporters who left Jerusalem with David or the soldiers who fought for David or for Absalom. In [chapter 15](../15/01.md), the term “people” seems to refer in each instance to the crowd, which included both soldiers and others. In [chapters 16–19](../16/01.md), the term means different things in different contexts. For example, in [16:6](../16/06.md), it seems to describe David’s soldiers, who surrounded him to protect him from the stones that Shimei was throwing at him. But in [16:14](../16/14.md) it seems to refer to the entire crowd that was with David. The UST gives an indication of the meaning in each context, and this may help you translate the term in that context in a way that will be helpful to your readers.\n\n### Hushai’s overstatement for emphasis\n\nIn [16:18](../16/18.md), Hushai tells Absalom that “every man of Israel” is supporting him. Hushai is saying **every** as an overstatement for emphasis to try to convince Absalom of his loyalty. Absalom himself has just acknowledged that many Israelites have gone with David, and he has suggested that Hushai might have done that himself. So Hushai really means that “very many” Israelites are supporting Absalom. However, it would be good to show in your translation that he is making an overstatement for emphasis, so we recommend that you not translate his statement as a less emphatic one.

16:5	o4k2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	יָצ֖וֹא וּ⁠מְקַלֵּֽל	1	The phrase **coming out and cursing** expresses a single idea.

In this case, Shimei is saying that David has the characteristics of being deadly violent and wicked.

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. The UST models one way to do that.
16:7	lze3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	אִ֥ישׁ הַ⁠דָּמִ֖ים	1	The word **blood** is plural here because it refers to blood shed by violence.

By saying that Yahweh has brought the blood of the house of Saul **upon** David, Shimei means that Yahweh is holding David responsible for shedding this blood and punishing him for doing that. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [Yahweh is holding you responsible for all of the blood of the house of Saul that you shed]
16:8	g1fs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הֵשִׁיב֩ עָלֶ֨י⁠ךָ יְהוָ֜ה כֹּ֣ל ׀ דְּמֵ֣י בֵית־שָׁא֗וּל	1	Shimei is using **blood** to represent death, since people bleed when they are killed violently.

16:10	yxfc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מַה־לִּ֥⁠י וְ⁠לָ⁠כֶ֖ם בְּנֵ֣י צְרֻיָ֑ה	1	David is using **What to me and to you** as a common expression of his culture to say that he has nothing in common with these **sons of Zeruiah** in terms of what they want to do. If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [I will have nothing to do with your suggestion, sons of Zeruiah!]
16:10	pwdn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	מַה־לִּ֥⁠י וְ⁠לָ⁠כֶ֖ם	1	The word **you** is plural here because David is addressing both Abishai and Joab.

If a speaker of your language would use an explicit pronoun for the same purpose, you may want to use that construction in your translation. If not, your language may have other ways of showing that Hushai is saying that his own actions will be comparable to those of others.

17:intro	abch				0	# 2 Samuel 17 Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the story of what David did as the king of Israel and specifically how he resisted Absalom’s attempt to replace him as king. It tells how Hushai the Archite, David’s friend, persuaded Absalom to reject the counsel of Ahithophel and not attack David immediately. This gave Hushai time to send David a warning so that he crossed the Jordan River to safety while Absalom was gathering a great army. The chapter also tells how other friends of David provided food and supplies for him. \n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### “the people”\n\nIn this chapter, the term “people” continues to vary in meaning. Sometimes it refers to David’s or Absalom’s soldiers, and sometimes it refers to the large group that left Jerusalem with David, which included many individuals who were not soldiers. The UST gives an indication of the meaning in each context, and this may help you translate the term in that context in a way that will be helpful to your readers.\n\n### Hushai’s overstatements for emphasis\n\nIn this chapter, Hushai continues to make overstatements for emphasis as he speaks to Absalom. He says in [17:11](../17/11.md) that Absalom may gather an army that is “like the sand that {is} by the sea for multitude,” that is, one that has too many troops to count. In [17:12](../17/12.md), he says that not a single soldier from David’s army will escape. And in [17:13](../17/13.md), he says that Absalom’s troops may tear down a city so that “not even a pebble will be found there.” These overstatements suggest that Hushai is loyal to Absalom. They also appeal to Absalom’s pride and vanity in order to get him to follow a course that is actually foolish and not in his interests. As with the overstatement made in [16:18](../16/18.md), we suggest that it would be good to show in your translation that Hushai is making overstatements for emphasis in these further cases, so we recommend that you not translate his statements as less emphatic ones.

17:3	zb5y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	כָּל־הָ⁠עָ֖ם יִהְיֶ֥ה שָׁלֽוֹם	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **peace**, you could express the same idea in another way. This could mean: (1) that all of the other people with David will be unharmed. The term “peace” would have the sense of “welfare” or “well-being.” Alternate translation: [All of the other people will be unharmed]; (2) that none of the people with David will continue fighting against Absalom once David is dead. The term “peace” would have the sense of “absence of war.” Alternate translation: [None of the other people will continue fighting against you]
17:4	vypl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יִּישַׁ֥ר הַ⁠דָּבָ֖ר	1	The author is using the term **word** to represent what Ahithophel said by using words. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [And what Ahithophel had said]

See how you translated the similar expression in [3:19](../03/19.md). Alternate translation: [seemed to Absalom and all of the elders of Israel to be the right thing to do]
17:5	o6py		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	וְ⁠נִשְׁמְעָ֥ה	1	Absalom is probably speaking to a servant or official while using the pronoun **us** to refer to himself and the elders of Israel. Since the addressee is probably not included, use the exclusive form of “us” if your language marks that distinction.
17:5	h9ir		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מַה־בְּ⁠פִ֖י⁠ו	1	Here, **in his mouth** represents “what he has to say.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [what he has to say]
17:5	yibm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	גַּם־הֽוּא	1	Absalom adds this phrase to clarify his meaning. Without it, the word **his** might apply to Ahithophel, and Absalom might mean that he wants to hear what Ahithophel says about what Hushai recommends. He is clarifying that his meaning is simply that he wants to hear what Hushai has to say. You could indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [for his part]

Rather, he gave Hushai a summary of what Ahithophel had said. Alternate translation: [and told him what Ahithophel had said. Then he asked, “Shall we do]
17:6	gn51		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֶת־דְּבָר֑⁠וֹ	1	Absalom is using the term **word** to represent what Ahithophel said by using words. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [what he has recommended]

He is doing that to emphasize that Absalom has knowledge that should make him realize that Ahithophel has not given good advice. If a speaker of your language would use an explicit pronoun for the same purpose, you may want to use that construction in your translation. If not, your language may have other ways of showing the meaning here. Alternate translation: [You know quite well that your father and his men are warriors]
17:8	di9w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠אֶת־אֲנָשָׁ֜י⁠ו & וּ⁠מָרֵ֥י נֶ֨פֶשׁ֙	1	Hushai is speaking as if David and his men actually had souls that were **bitter**. He means that they were easily provoked to violence. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. If you have already translated the book of Judges, see how you translated the similar expression in [Judges 18:25](../../jdg/18/25.md). Alternate translation: [and prone to violence]
17:8	f793		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	כְּ⁠דֹ֥ב שַׁכּ֖וּל	1	The expression **bereaved** is a passive verbal form.

17:8	xfy8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כְּ⁠דֹ֥ב שַׁכּ֖וּל בַּ⁠שָּׂדֶ֑ה	1	Hushai is using this comparison to make the point that just as a **bear bereaved in the field** is enraged and aggressive, so David and his men will be as well. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: [as vicious as a bear in the wild whose cubs have been taken] or [as fierce as a bear in the wild that has lost her young]
17:8	fw5l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	אִ֣ישׁ מִלְחָמָ֔ה	1	Hushai is using this possessive form to describe a **man** who is characterized by having much experience in **war**. If a speaker of your language would not use the possessive form in that way, you could express this idea in another way. Alternate translation: [is an experienced warrior]
17:9	a7gs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הִנֵּ֨ה	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [1:2](../01/02.md). Alternate translation: [Listen]
17:9	sud9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	א֖וֹ בְּ⁠אַחַ֣ד הַ⁠מְּקוֹמֹ֑ת	1	The author is using **one of the places** as a common expression of his culture to mean “some other such place.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [or in some other such place]
17:9	l4xs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	כִּ⁠נְפֹ֤ל בָּ⁠הֶם֙	1	The author is using the term **fall** by association to mean that they died, since people fall down when they die. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. See how you translated the similar expression in [2:16](../02/16.md). Alternate translation: [when some among them die] or [when some among them are killed]
17:9	b95v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	כִּ⁠נְפֹ֤ל בָּ⁠הֶם֙	1	The pronoun **them** refers to the soldiers whom Ahithophel wants to lead out against David.

17:10	pphl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	אֲשֶׁ֥ר לִבּ֛⁠וֹ כְּ⁠לֵ֥ב הָ⁠אַרְיֵ֖ה	1	The point of this comparison is that just as **a lion** has great courage, so does King David.

Alternate translation: [since all of Israel knows that your father is a warrior and they who are with him are sons of valor, melting, he will melt]
17:10	x0go		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	הִמֵּ֣ס יִמָּ֑ס	1	Hushai is repeating forms of the verb **melt** in order to intensify his expression of the idea that it conveys. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the intensification. Alternate translation: [he will certainly melt]
17:10	uua6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הִמֵּ֣ס יִמָּ֑ס	1	Hushai is speaking as if even the bravest warrior in Absalom’s army would actually **melt** when he heard that David’s soldiers were killing the soldiers in his army. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. If you have already translated the book of Joshua, see how you translated the similar expressions in [Joshua 2:11](../../jos/02/11.md), [Joshua 5:1](../../jos/05/01.md), and [Joshua 7:5](../../jos/07/05.md).

Alternate translation: [you shall certainly gather all of Israel]
17:11	jwmi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הֵ֠אָסֹף יֵאָסֵ֨ף & כָל־יִשְׂרָאֵל֙	1	**Israel** represents “the soldiers of Israel.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language, here and in [verse 13](../17/13.md). Alternate translation: [you shall certainly gather all of the soldiers of Israel] or [you shall certainly gather the entire Israelite army]

17:11	flp6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כַּ⁠ח֥וֹל אֲשֶׁר־עַל־הַ⁠יָּ֖ם לָ⁠רֹ֑ב	1	The point of this comparison is that just as **the sand that is by the sea** is uncountable, so would be the soldiers whom Absalom would gather. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: [like the seemingly countless grains of sand that are by the sea for multitude]
17:11	riow		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	כַּ⁠ח֥וֹל אֲשֶׁר־עַל־הַ⁠יָּ֖ם לָ⁠רֹ֑ב	1	By suggesting that Absalom will have too many troops to count, Hushai is making an overstatement for emphasis in order to convince Absalom to follow his advice. See the discussion in the Introduction to this chapter of how you might represent this overstatement and the ones in the next two verses in your translation.
17:11	qexl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וּ⁠פָנֶ֥י⁠ךָ הֹלְכִ֖ים בַּ⁠קְרָֽב	1	Hushai is using one part of Absalom, his **face**, to represent Absalom himself.

Alternate translation: [And you personally shall go into the battle as the Israelite commander]
17:12	y86w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֲשֶׁ֣ר נִמְצָ֣א שָׁ֔ם	1	It might seem that this expression contains extra information that would not be natural to express in your language. If so, you can shorten it. Alternate translation: [where he may be found]

17:12	xci1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	נ֥וֹתַר	1	The expression **will be left** is a passive verbal form. If your language would not use that form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [will remain]
17:13	er1e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	יֵֽאָסֵ֔ף	1	Here, David **himself** represents him and all of his forces. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [he gathers his forces]
17:13	l4fn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עַד־הַ⁠נַּ֔חַל	1	Hushai is assuming that David would retreat into a fortified city that had been built on a hill above a valley or ravine through which water sometimes flowed. Since [16:2](../16/02.md) indicates that it was summer at this time, Hushai may not be expecting that water would be flowing. So you may wish to describe this feature without implying that there would be water in it. Alternate translation: [down into the ravine below]
17:13	wqyh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לֹא־נִמְצָ֥א שָׁ֖ם גַּם־צְרֽוֹר	1	Hushai is using the term **found** in a way characteristic of his language and culture to mean that such a **pebble** will not be able to **be found**, that is, it will not be there.

If you have already translated the book of 1 Samuel, see how you translated the similar expression in [1 Samuel 9:8](../../1sa/09/08.md). Alternate translation: [not even a pebble will be there]

He means that Ahithophel’s counsel would have been “good” for Absalom in the sense that it would have been more effective in defeating David. You could translate the term that way if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [the counsel of Ahithophel that would have been more effective]

17:18	igic		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	מְהֵרָ֜ה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **haste**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [hastily]
17:19	y93n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	וַ⁠תִּקַּ֣ח הָ⁠אִשָּׁ֗ה	1	The context indicates that this **woman** was married to the man whom the author describes in the previous verse. Your language may have its own term or expression for this relationship. Alternate translation: [And his wife]
17:19	s003		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	פְּנֵ֣י הַ⁠בְּאֵ֔ר	1	The author is using **the face of the well** as a common expression of his culture to mean “the top of the well” or “the opening of the well.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [the mouth of the well]
17:19	n851		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠לֹ֥א נוֹדַ֖ע דָּבָֽר	1	The expression **was not known** is a passive verbal form. If your language would not use that form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [so no one knew the matter]
17:20	ax08		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	מִיכַ֣ל הַ⁠מָּ֑יִם	1	It might seem that the expression **brook of waters** contains extra information that would not be natural to express in your language. If so, you could shorten it. Alternate translation: [that brook]
17:21	prwm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֣י	1	The author is using the phrase **And it happened** to introduce a new development in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new development.
17:21	jsu7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אַחֲרֵ֣י לֶכְתָּ֗⁠ם וַֽ⁠יַּעֲלוּ֙	1	The first pronoun **they** refers to Absalom’s soldiers, while the second pronoun **they** refers to Jonathan and Ahimaaz.

Alternate translation: [And they told David what Ahithophel had counseled against him and then said, “Arise and cross over the waters in haste.”]
17:21	m6sz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ק֣וּמוּ וְ⁠עִבְר֤וּ מְהֵרָה֙ אֶת־הַ⁠מַּ֔יִם כִּי־כָ֛כָה יָעַ֥ץ עֲלֵי⁠כֶ֖ם אֲחִיתֹֽפֶל	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: [Since according to this Ahithophel has counseled against you, arise and cross over the waters in haste]
17:21	pswr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	ק֣וּמוּ וְ⁠עִבְר֤וּ & עֲלֵי⁠כֶ֖ם	1	The word **you** and the implied “you” in the imperatives **Arise** and **cross over** are plural because Jonathan and Ahimaaz mean David and all of the people who are with him. So use plural forms in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
17:21	dvus		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֶת־הַ⁠מַּ֔יִם	1	The implication is that **the waters** refers to the Jordan River. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [the Jordan River]

If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this. Alternate translation: [every one of them had crossed the Jordan]
17:22	zde2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	אַחַד֙ לֹ֣א נֶעְדָּ֔ר	1	The expression **was missing** is a passive verbal form.

17:23	vpm7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יְצַ֥ו אֶל־בֵּית֖⁠וֹ	1	The author is using **commanded about his house** as a common expression of his culture to mean “put his affairs in order” or “arranged his household affairs.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [and he put his house in order]
17:23	rhmb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וַ⁠יִּקָּבֵ֖ר	1	The expression **was buried** is a passive verbal form.

17:24	vdpf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	וְ⁠כָל־אִ֥ישׁ יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל	1	The author is saying **all of the men of Israel** as a generalization for emphasis.

17:25	g9lt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	וּ⁠שְׁמ⁠וֹ֙ יִתְרָ֣א הַ⁠יִּשְׂרְאֵלִ֔י	1	The account of Amasa’s lineage in [1 Chronicles 2:17](../../1ch/02/17.md) identifies his father as “Jether the Ishmaelite.” The name Jether is simply a variant of the name Ithra, but “Ishmaelite” may have been the original reading here, since identifying Ithra as an **Israelite** would not provide information that would help readers distinguish him from other men by the same name. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.

17:25	qnjt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	אֲשֶׁר־בָּא֙ אֶל־אֲבִיגַ֣ל בַּת־נָחָ֔שׁ	1	The author is referring to sexual relations in a polite way by using the phrase **had gone in to**. The implication, which the author is politely not stating directly, is that Ithra had not necessarily been married to Abigail. Depending on what is helpful in your language, you could use a polite way of referring to this in your language, or you could state this plainly. Alternate translation: [who had slept with Abigail, the daughter of Nahash]
17:28	het8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge	מִשְׁכָּ֤ב וְ⁠סַפּוֹת֙	1	The main verb of this sentence, “brought,” occurs in the next verse. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine [17:28](../17/28.md) and [17:29](../17/29.md) into a verse bridge so that you can put the verb “brought” before the list of things that these men provided. You could also state the verb, which is implied in the context, in this verse and repeat it in the next verse. The UST models one way to do that.
17:28	fpg9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וּ⁠כְלִ֣י יוֹצֵ֔ר	1	Here, **vessels of the potter** represents “earthenware vessels” or “clay pots.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [earthenware vessels]
17:28	mt12		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠קָלִ֑י & וְ⁠קָלִֽי	1	The term that the ULT translates as **roasted grain** is the same one that it translates as **roasted beans**, but the context suggests that the author is not listing the same item twice. Instead, this term describes the way in which the grain and beans were prepared.
17:28	gxe0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	וּ⁠פ֥וֹל וַ⁠עֲדָשִׁ֖ים	1	The term **beans** describes edible seeds that typically grow in pods. A **lentil** is a kind of small, round, edible seed. If your readers would not be familiar with these foods, you could use the name of a similar thing that your readers would recognize, or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: [and peas and small beans]
17:29	jcw9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	וְ⁠חֶמְאָ֗ה	1	The word **curds** describes a soft, thickened milk product similar to yogurt. If your readers would not be familiar with what curds are, you could use the name of a similar thing that your readers would recognize, or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: [and yogurt] or [and soured milk]
17:29	dln5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	רָעֵ֛ב וְ⁠עָיֵ֥ף וְ⁠צָמֵ֖א	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you may want to put the information about thirst with the information about hunger. Alternate translation: [hungry and thirsty and weary]
18:intro	abci				0	# 2 Samuel 18 Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the story of what David did as the king of Israel and specifically how he finally overcame Absalom’s attempt to replace him as king. It tells how David’s soldiers fought against Absalom’s army and defeated it. It describes how Joab killed Absalom even though David had publicly ordered him to spare Absalom. And it tells how messengers brought the news of Absalom’s defeat and death to David and how David mourned publicly for his son. \n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Why did Joab want to send his Cushite servant as a messenger to David instead of Ahimaaz?\n\nIn [18:19](../18/19.md), Ahimaaz asks Joab for permission to run to David and bring him the news that his soldiers have defeated Absalom’s army. Joab at first refuses and instead sends an Ethiopian man who served him as a runner. We learn from the story in [4:10](../04/10.md) that in this culture, someone who brought good news often received a reward. Joab tells Ahimaaz in [18:22](../18/22.md) that he would not receive a reward if he brought the news of the battle to David. By sending a slave with the news instead of a friend or a person of rank (such as the high priest’s son, Ahimaaz), Joab was signaling in advance that he did not expect the news to win a reward for the messenger. This was a way of breaking the news of Absalom’s death to David slowly and in stages. Joab evidently also anticipated that David would be more upset at the news of Absalom’s death than he would be with the news that his army had won a great victory, and since he apparently liked and appreciated Ahimaaz (he calls him “my son” in [18:22](../18/22.md)), he may have wanted to spare him from any angry reaction that David may have had. But Ahimaaz, for his part, seems to have wanted to encourage David first with the news of the victory, and so he persisted in asking for permission to run as a messenger. When Joab gave his permission, Ahimaaz ran by a route he knew would be faster, and he got to David first with this part of the news. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain all or some of this in the text of your translation or in a footnote.
18:2	daxm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-fraction	הַ⁠שְּׁלִשִׁ֤ית	1	A **third** means one part out of three equal parts. Represent this in the way your language and culture characteristically would.
18:2	aumu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠יַד־יוֹאָב֙	1	Here, **hand** represents the control of a person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly, in this case and for the same expression as applied to Abishai and Ittai. Alternate translation: [under the command of Joab]
18:2	gia4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	אֲבִישַׁ֤י בֶּן־צְרוּיָה֙ אֲחִ֣י יוֹאָ֔ב	1	The author is identifying **Abishai**, not **Zeruiah**, as the **brother of Joab**. Be sure that this is clear in your translation.
18:2	fyit		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	יָצֹ֥א אֵצֵ֛א גַּם־אֲנִ֖י	1	David is repeating forms of the verb **go out** in order to intensify his expression of the idea that it conveys. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the intensification. Alternate translation: [I will certainly go out, I too]
18:2	mweh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יָצֹ֥א אֵצֵ֛א גַּם־אֲנִ֖י	1	David is stating the pronoun **I** separately, even though the verb translated as **I will go out** already includes this meaning. He is doing that to indicate that his actions will be comparable to those of the Israelite soldiers and commanders. If a speaker of your language would use an explicit pronoun for the same purpose, you may want to use that construction in your translation. If not, your language may have other ways of showing that David is indicating that his actions will be comparable. It may not be necessary to represent the separately stated pronoun explicitly. Alternate translation: [And for my own part, going out, I will go out] or [And for my own part, I will certainly go out]
18:3	j9tf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	אִם־נֹ֨ס נָנ֜וּס	1	The soldiers are repeating forms of the verb **flee** in order to intensify their expression of the idea that it conveys. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the intensification. Alternate translation: [if in fact we flee]
18:3	vzv1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לֹא־יָשִׂ֧ימוּ אֵלֵ֣י⁠נוּ לֵ֗ב	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [13:20](../13/20.md). Alternate translation: [they will not be concerned about us]
18:3	urs9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-fraction	חֶצְיֵ֨⁠נוּ֙	1	A **half** means one part out of two equal parts. Represent this in the way your language and culture characteristically would.
18:3	lzuz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	כִּֽי־עַתָּ֥ה כָמֹ֖⁠נוּ עֲשָׂרָ֣ה אֲלָפִ֑ים	1	The Septuagint (an ancient Greek translation) reads “you” instead of **now**. This reflects a difference of only one letter in Hebrew, and it gives the meaning, “For you are worth ten thousand of us.” That may have been the original reading, since it does not require the reader to supply the rest of the thought (as the traditional Hebrew text requires, “but there is only one like you”). If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
18:4	mpdo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אֲשֶׁר־יִיטַ֥ב בְּ⁠עֵינֵי⁠כֶ֖ם אֶעֱשֶׂ֑ה	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [3:19](../03/19.md). Alternate translation: [I will do as you see fit] or [I will do what you think is best]

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action in the text of your translation or in a footnote. Alternate translation: [And the king took his place beside the gate to review the troops as they marched out in their military units]
18:4	b4il		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אֶל־יַ֣ד הַ⁠שַּׁ֔עַר	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [15:2](../15/02.md). Alternate translation: [next to the gate]
18:5	weaj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	לְ⁠אַט־לִ֖⁠י	1	David is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: [Deal gently for my sake]
18:5	auta		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	לַ⁠נַּ֣עַר	1	David could have referred to Absalom as “my son” rather than as **the young man**. However, by rebelling against his father, Absalom was acting in a way unworthy of a son, so David did not describe him in terms of their family relationship. So while the expression “young man” can have the sense of “son” in some contexts, it would not be appropriate to translate it that way here.
18:6	zins		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל	1	Here, **Israel** represents “the Israelite army.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [the Israelite army]
18:6	dbkr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	בְּ⁠יַ֥עַר אֶפְרָֽיִם	1	This is a name, not a description of a forest within the territory of the tribe of Ephraim. That territory was west of the Jordan River, while the narrative makes clear that this battle was fought on the east side of the river. This forest is not mentioned elsewhere in the Bible, and it is not entirely clear how it got this name. But translate this as a name, not as a description.
18:7	jkr4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יִּנָּ֤גְפוּ שָׁם֙ עַ֣ם יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל לִ⁠פְנֵ֖י עַבְדֵ֣י דָוִ֑ד	1	Here, **to the face of** represents being in front of David’s servants, that is, opposing them in battle. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [And the people of Israel were struck there in front of the servants of David] or [ And the people of Israel were struck there as they opposed the servants of David]
18:7	cpg6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וַ⁠יִּנָּ֤גְפוּ שָׁם֙ עַ֣ם יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל לִ⁠פְנֵ֖י עַבְדֵ֣י דָוִ֑ד	1	The expression **were struck** is a passive verbal form. If your language would not use that form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [And the servants of David struck the people of Israel there as they opposed them]
18:7	e4uh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יִּנָּ֤גְפוּ & עַ֣ם יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [2:17](../02/17.md). Alternate translation: [And the people of Israel were defeated]
18:7	llq6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הַ⁠מַּגֵּפָ֧ה	1	While the word **struck** in the previous sentence describes defeat, the term **striking** in this sentence describes killing. You could indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. See the discussion of the term “struck” in the Introduction to 2 Samuel. Alternate translation: [the slaughter]
18:7	wqp9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	עֶשְׂרִ֥ים אָֽלֶף	1	The author is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: [for 20,000 Israelite soldiers were killed]
18:8	ri3y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וַ⁠תְּהִי & הַ⁠מִּלְחָמָ֛ה נָפֹ֖צֶת	1	The expression **was scattered** is a passive verbal form. If your language would not use that form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [And the battle spread out]
18:8	q8r4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	פְּנֵ֣י	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [11:11](../11/11.md). Alternate translation: [the surface of]

If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. This could mean: (1) Alternate translation: [And more of Absalom’s soldiers died from injuries they suffered trying to flee through the forest than died from injuries they suffered from the swords that David’s soldiers used against them]; (2) Alternate translation: [And more of Absalom’s soldiers died during the fighting in the forest, which slowed them down as they were trying to flee, than died from the fighting in the open field]
18:8	qnfn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	וַ⁠יֶּ֤רֶב הַ⁠יַּ֨עַר֙ לֶ⁠אֱכֹ֣ל בָּ⁠עָ֔ם	1	Together, the terms **made more** and **to consume** expresses a single idea. The term **made more** tells to what extent the forest consumed or killed soldiers, that is, to a greater extent than the weapons opposing soldiers were using. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this meaning in a different way. Alternate translation: [And the forest consumed more of the people] or [And the forest killed more of the people]
18:9	ni46		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יִּקָּרֵא֙ אַבְשָׁל֔וֹם לִ⁠פְנֵ֖י עַבְדֵ֣י דָוִ֑ד	1	Here, **to the face of** represents being in the presence of David’s servants. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [And Absalom encountered some of the servants of David]

Alternate translation: [And Absalom unexpectedly found himself in the presence of the servants of David] or [And Absalom happened to come into the presence of the servants of David]
18:9	nl90		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וְ⁠אַבְשָׁל֞וֹם רֹכֵ֣ב עַל־הַ⁠פֶּ֗רֶד	1	Here, the author is providing background information to help readers understand what happens next in the story. In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
18:9	nswo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וְ⁠אַבְשָׁל֞וֹם רֹכֵ֣ב עַל־הַ⁠פֶּ֗רֶד	1	Riding on a mule was a symbolic action by which Absalom showed that he claimed to be king of Israel, since kings rode on mules. (For example, David has Solomon ride on his mule in [1 Kings 1:33](../../1ki/01/33.md) to show that he has chosen him to be the next king.) If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action in the text of your translation or in a footnote. Alternate translation: [Now Absalom was riding on the royal mule]
18:9	sokc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	וַ⁠יָּבֹ֣א הַ⁠פֶּ֡רֶד	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “went” instead of **came**. Alternate translation: [and the mule went]

18:11	bkor		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אָ֑רְצָ⁠ה	1	Joab is using **to the ground** as a common expression of his culture to mean “right where he is.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [on the spot]
18:11	bvrh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	כֶ֔סֶף	1	Joab is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: [shekels of silver]
18:11	cjkf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠עָלַ֗⁠י לָ֤⁠תֶת לְ⁠ךָ֙	1	Joab is using **{it was} to me** as a common expression of his culture to mean “I had the capacity.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [For I could have given you]
18:11	c1zd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וַ⁠חֲגֹרָ֖ה אֶחָֽת	1	In this culture, commanders would give a soldier a decorative and costly military **belt** in recognition of distinguished service in battle. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action in the text or in a footnote. Alternate translation: [and a military belt for distinguished service] or [and a military decoration]
18:12	ln8f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אָנֹכִ֜י שֹׁקֵ֤ל עַל־כַּפַּ⁠י֙	1	While this soldier might have hefted the silver in his **palm** or hand to be sure it was the entire weight Joab promised, the term **palm** in this context also represents possession. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [I had in my possession]
18:12	dmf6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	אֶ֣לֶף כֶּ֔סֶף	1	The soldier is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: [a thousand shekels of silver]
18:12	gdtc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bweight	אֶ֣לֶף כֶּ֔סֶף	1	These 1,000 **silver** shekels would have weighed nearly 12 kilograms or over 25 pounds. In your translation, you could use the ancient measurement and spell the word “shekel” the way it sounds in your language. You could also use the metric measurement given in the UST or use the measurement that your language and culture customarily use. Alternatively, you could use the ancient measurement and put a modern measurement in parentheses in the text or in a footnote.

18:12	q400		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	שִׁמְרוּ־מִ֕י בַּ⁠נַּ֖עַר	1	In paraphrasing what David said, the soldier is using **Guard who is upon** as a common expression of his culture to mean “make sure that no one hurts.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [Make sure that no one hurts]

Alternate translation: [since every matter is not hidden from the king, I would have done wrong against my life]
18:13	sf1h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	שֶׁ֔קֶר	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **wrong**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [something wrong]

18:13	pbid		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠אַתָּ֖ה תִּתְיַצֵּ֥ב מִ⁠נֶּֽגֶד	1	The soldier is using **stationed yourself from before me** as a common expression of his culture to mean “kept your distance” or “would not have defended me.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [and you would have kept your distance from me] or [and you would not have defended me]
18:14	p6vz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לְ⁠פָנֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1	Here, **to your face** represents being in your presence. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [in your presence] or [here with you]
18:14	ke93		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠כַפּ֗⁠וֹ	1	Here, **in his palm** represents possession and conveyance. (These **spears** were likely too large to have all fit in Joab’s palm.) If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [with him]
18:14	fq0x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בְּ⁠לֵ֣ב אַבְשָׁל֔וֹם	1	Here the word **heart** probably refers to Absalom’s chest or torso, the central part of his body. (It has the same sense as in the phrase **the heart of the oak tree** in the next clause.) It is unlikely that Absalom would still have been alive afterwards if Joab had thrust three spears into his actual heart. You could indicate this meaning in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [into the chest of Absalom] or [into Absalom’s body]
18:14	kz75		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בְּ⁠לֵ֥ב הָ⁠אֵלָֽה	1	The author is using **in the heart of the oak tree** as a common expression of his culture to mean “in the midst of the oak tree” or “among the branches of the oak tree.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [in the midst of the oak tree] or [among the branches of the oak tree]

Alternate translation: [and since Joab had restrained the people, the people returned from pursuing after Israel]
18:16	sgme		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל	1	Here, **Israel** represents “the Israelite soldiers.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [the Israelite soldiers]

The Israelites had done this, for example, to Achan in [Joshua 7:26](../../jos/07/26.md). Some interpreters believe that in this case, it was also symbolic of the stoning that the Law of Moses said was the penalty for a rebellious son ([Deuteronomy 21:18–21](../../deu/21/18.md). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action in the text or in a footnote. Alternate translation: [and to shame him, they set over him a very great heap of stones]
18:17	md9g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אִ֥ישׁ ל⁠אהל⁠ו	1	The author is using **a man to his tent** as a common expression of his culture to mean that the soldiers stopped their military campaign altogether and each of them went back to his home and family. If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [abandoning the army and returning home]

His monument turned out to be the shameful pile of stones, not the one described here. In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
18:18	trz1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֵֽין־לִ֣⁠י בֵ֔ן	1	The author says in [14:27](../14/27.md) that Absalom had three sons, so they had all apparently died by the time Absalom set up this pillar. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. The UST models one way to do that.
18:18	li1l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וַ⁠יִּקָּ֤רֵא לָ⁠הּ֙	1	The expression **it is called** is a passive verbal form. If your language would not use that form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [and people call it]
18:18	kdln		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עַ֖ד הַ⁠יּ֥וֹם הַ⁠זֶּֽה	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [4:3](../04/03.md). Alternate translation: [as of the time of this writing]
18:18	gslx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	יַ֣ד אַבְשָׁלֹ֔ם	1	In this culture, people used the term **Hand** to mean a monument. They may have done this because ancient monuments may have had an image of a hand engraved or sculpted on them as a symbol of power and strength, or because monuments called attention to an achievement, as a gesturing hand would do. If you have already translated the book of 1 Samuel, see how you translated the similar expression in [1 Samuel 15:12](../../1sa/15/12.md). Alternate translation, as in the UST: [Absalom’s Monument]
18:19	jcwh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	אָר֣וּצָה נָּ֔א וַ⁠אֲבַשְּׂרָ֖ה אֶת־הַ⁠מֶּ֑לֶךְ כִּי־שְׁפָט֥⁠וֹ יְהוָ֖ה מִ⁠יַּ֥ד אֹיְבָֽי⁠ו	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: [Since Yahweh has judged the king out of the hand of his enemies, please let me run and bring news to him]
18:19	lgqs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	שְׁפָט֥⁠וֹ יְהוָ֖ה מִ⁠יַּ֥ד אֹיְבָֽי⁠ו	1	The author is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

18:19	gn56		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִ⁠יַּ֥ד אֹיְבָֽי⁠ו	1	Here, **hand** represents the capability of a person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [the power of his enemies]
18:20	z1s7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אִ֨ישׁ בְּשֹׂרָ֤ה	1	Joab is saying **man of** here in the same way that biblical authors and characters often use the similar expression “son of” to indicate that a person has the characteristic of something. See how you translated the similar expression in [16:7](../16/07.md). Alternate translation: [a man who brings news] or [the one to bring the news]
18:20	csg3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	וְ⁠הַ⁠יּ֤וֹם הַ⁠זֶּה֙ לֹ֣א תְבַשֵּׂ֔ר כִּֽי־על בֶּן־הַ⁠מֶּ֖לֶךְ מֵֽת	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: [But since the son of the king is dead, this day you will not bring news]
18:21	ok4y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לַ⁠כּוּשִׁ֔י	1	The author assumes that his readers will know that by **the Cushite**, he means a particular man from the region of Cush (modern Ethiopia) who was able to run far and fast and so served Joab as a messenger. You could say that explicitly if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [the Cushite man who served him as a swift messenger]
18:21	h7ux		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וַ⁠יִּשְׁתַּ֧חוּ כוּשִׁ֛י לְ⁠יוֹאָ֖ב	1	Bowing down before Joab was a symbolic action by which the Cushite showed his respect and submission to Joab’s authority to indicate that he would obey Joab’s command. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action in the text of your translation or in a footnote. Alternate translation: [And the Cushite expressed his obedience to Joab]
18:22	zooy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	וַ⁠יֹּ֨סֶף ע֜וֹד אֲחִימַ֤עַץ בֶּן־צָדוֹק֙ וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר	1	It might seem that saying both **again** and **resumed** would be extra information that would not be natural to express in your language. If so, you could shorten this. Alternate translation: [And Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok, resumed and said]
18:22	rfm6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	וַ⁠יֹּ֨סֶף ע֜וֹד אֲחִימַ֤עַץ בֶּן־צָדוֹק֙ וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר	1	It might seem that saying both **again** and **resumed** would be to present extra information that would not be natural in your language. If so, you can just use one of these terms. Alternate translation: [And Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok, said again]
18:22	bht4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rpronouns	אָרֻֽצָה־נָּ֥א גַם־אָ֖נִי	1	Ahimaaz is stating the pronoun **I** separately, even though the verb translated as **let me run** already includes this meaning. He is doing that to indicate that his action would be comparable to that of the **Cushite**. If a speaker of your language would use an explicit pronoun for the same purpose, you may want to use that construction in your translation. If not, your language may have other ways of showing that Ahimaaz is indicating that his action would be comparable. It may not be necessary to represent the separately stated pronoun explicitly. Alternate translation: [please let me run, for my own part]
18:22	eh3e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	לָֽ⁠מָּה־זֶּ֞ה אַתָּ֥ה רָץ֙ בְּנִ֔⁠י וּ⁠לְ⁠כָ֖ה אֵין־בְּשׂוֹרָ֥ה מֹצֵֽאת	1	Joab is using the question form to rebuke Ahimaaz for wanting to run. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [You should not be running, my son, when for you there is no news finding!]
18:22	e4lw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לָֽ⁠מָּה־זֶּ֞ה אַתָּ֥ה רָץ֙	1	Joab is using **Why {is} this, you running** as a common expression of his culture to mean “Why would you run?” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [For what reason would you run]
18:22	wu6u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	בְּנִ֔⁠י	1	Joab is referring to Ahimaaz with an affectionate expression. Use a comparable title or expression from your language and culture for addressing someone affectionately. Alternate translation: [young man]
18:22	wfqz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	אֵין־בְּשׂוֹרָ֥ה מֹצֵֽאת	1	Joab is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: [there is no news finding a reward]
18:22	h2p9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	אֵין־בְּשׂוֹרָ֥ה מֹצֵֽאת	1	Joab is speaking of **news** as if it were a living thing that could find something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [there is no news for which King David would reward you]
18:23	cxu0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וִ⁠יהִי־מָ֣ה אָר֔וּץ	1	The direct quotation can be marked to clearly show that these are Ahimaaz’s words. Use whatever punctuation or other ways of indicating quotations that are natural in your language. Alternate translation: [But Ahimaaz replied, “But whatever may be, let me run.”]
18:23	guca		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֹּ֥אמֶר ל֖⁠וֹ	1	The pronoun **he** refers to Joab, while the pronoun **him** refers to Ahimaaz. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: [And Joab said to Ahimaaz]
18:23	w5tg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	ר֑וּץ	1	This is an imperative, but it communicates permission rather than a command. Use a form in your language that communicates permission. Alternate translation: [You may run]
18:23	f5g6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַֽ⁠יַּעֲבֹ֖ר אֶת־הַ⁠כּוּשִֽׁי	1	The implication is that Ahimaaz ran faster than the Cushite and got to King David before he did. The author indicates that Ahimaaz took a different route, so it was not the case that he **passed** the Cushite in the sense of running past him on the same road. Indicate this in your translation in a way that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [and he outran the Cushite]
18:24	qtac		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וְ⁠דָוִ֥ד יוֹשֵׁ֖ב בֵּין־שְׁנֵ֣י הַ⁠שְּׁעָרִ֑ים	1	The author is providing background information to help readers understand what happens next in the story.

18:24	muo6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בֵּין־שְׁנֵ֣י הַ⁠שְּׁעָרִ֑ים	1	This phrase means the same thing as the phrase “in the middle of the gate” in [3:27](../03/27.md). See how you translated that phrase.
18:24	jtuq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּשָּׂ֤א אֶת־עֵינָי⁠ו֙	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [13:34](../13/34.md). Alternate translation: [and he looked off into the distance]
18:25	dsn8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּשׂוֹרָ֣ה בְּ⁠פִ֑י⁠ו	1	David is using the term **mouth** to mean that the messenger would use his mouth to say or tell something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [he has some news to tell]
18:25	m4zw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	וַ⁠יֵּ֥לֶךְ הָל֖וֹךְ וְ⁠קָרֵֽב	1	Together, the words **coming** and **near** express a single idea. The word **near** indicates that the messenger got nearer and nearer as he was **coming**. If it would be more natural in your language, you could express this idea in a different way. Alternate translation: [And as he came, he kept coming nearer and nearer]
18:26	ca9g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֶל־הַ⁠שֹּׁעֵ֔ר	1	The phrase translated as **to the gatekeeper** could also be translated “into the gate,” that is, down to where David was. That may be the correct translation, since David responds directly to what the watcher says, and there is no mention of a gatekeeper in the previous verse when the watcher similarly calls to David. Alternate translation: [into the gate]
18:27	bpij		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	אֲנִ֤י רֹאֶה֙ אֶת־מְרוּצַ֣ת הָ⁠רִאשׁ֔וֹן כִּ⁠מְרֻצַ֖ת אֲחִימַ֣עַץ	1	The watcher is using a participle form to describe an impression that is forming as he looks. Your language may have a verb form or comparable expression that would convey this meaning. Alternate translation: [The running of the first appears to me like the running of Ahimaaz]
18:28	i9hr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר	1	The expression **and said** introduces a direct quotation. In your translation, use a natural way of introducing direct quotations in your language. It may not be necessary to represent this expression explicitly.
18:28	m6td		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	בָּרוּךְ֙ יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔י⁠ךָ	1	The expression **Blessed be** is a passive verbal form. If your language would not use that form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [Bless Yahweh your God]
18:28	oa3e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֲשֶׁ֤ר סִגַּר֙ אֶת־הָ֣⁠אֲנָשִׁ֔ים	1	Ahimaaz is speaking as if Yahweh had actually **enclosed** Absalom’s soldiers in the hands of David’s soldiers, that is, as if Yahweh had enabled David’s soldiers to grasp Absalom’s soldiers completely in their hands. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. If you have already translated the book of 1 Samuel, see how you translated the similar expression in [1 Samuel 17:46](../../1sa/17/46.md). Alternate translation: [who has enabled your soldiers to overpower the men]
18:28	gs5o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אֲשֶׁר־נָשְׂא֥וּ אֶת־יָדָ֖⁠ם	1	Ahimaaz is using **lifted their hand** as a common expression of his culture to mean “used violence.” (The meaning is the same as in the similar phrase “stretch out my hand” in [18:12](../18/12.md).) If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [who took up arms] or [who violently rebelled]
18:28	yb1e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	בַּֽ⁠אדֹנִ֥⁠י הַ⁠מֶּֽלֶךְ	1	Even though Ahimaaz is addressing David directly, he is speaking of him in the third person as **my lord the king** to show respect. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in a respectful form in the second person, here and in [verses 31](../18/31.md) and [32](../18/32.md). Alternate translation: [you, my lord the king]
18:29	jckg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	שָׁל֥וֹם לַ⁠נַּ֖עַר לְ⁠אַבְשָׁל֑וֹם	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **peace**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [Is the young man Absalom well]
18:29	at1f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֶת־עֶ֨בֶד הַ⁠מֶּ֤לֶךְ	1	The implication is that this refers to the Cushite messenger who was sent after Ahimaaz.

18:29	i9hh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	וְ⁠אֶת־עַבְדֶּ֔⁠ךָ	1	Ahimaaz is speaking of himself in the third person as **your servant** to show humility.

18:29	n7uu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠לֹ֥א יָדַ֖עְתִּי מָֽה	1	Ahimaaz is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: [but I do not know what was happening]
18:31	vnz8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	שְׁפָטְ⁠ךָ֤ יְהוָה֙ הַ⁠יּ֔וֹם מִ⁠יַּ֖ד כָּל־הַ⁠קָּמִ֥ים עָלֶֽי⁠ךָ	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [18:19](../18/19.md).

18:31	g3fe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	מִ⁠יַּ֖ד	1	In this verse, the word **hand** is singular in form, but it refers to all of the hands of David’s enemies as a group. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the plural form of “hand.” Alternate translation: [the hands of]
18:31	ruds		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	הַ⁠קָּמִ֥ים עָלֶֽי⁠ךָ	1	The phrase **the ones having arisen against you** was a common expression meaning those who rebel against authority or try to overthrow someone from power. Alternate translation: [the ones who tried to overthrow you]

David nevertheless understands his meaning clearly and goes away to grieve. In your translation, it would be appropriate to represent this as an indirect statement, rather than suggest that the Cushite said directly that Absalom had died. You may be able to indicate this meaning another way. The UST models one way to do that.
18:33	ei6z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	בְּנִ֣⁠י בְנִ֣⁠י אַבְשָׁל֔וֹם	1	David repeats the words **my son** to show how deeply distressed he is about his son’s death.

19:intro	abcj				0	# 2 Samuel 19 Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the story of what David did as the king of Israel and specifically how the Israelites restored him to his position as their king. It first tells how Joab warned David not to stay away from his army, shaming them by mourning for the commander of the army they had defeated. It then describes how the people of Israel discussed among themselves how they should bring David back, and how David sent messengers to encourage the leaders of the tribe of Judah to take the lead in doing this. The chapter tells how David met various people on his way back to cross the Jordan River, including Shimei, who had cursed him; Mephibosheth, who had been unable to join him because Ziba deceived him; and Barzillai, who had provided for him. The chapter concludes by describing how the leaders of Judah escorted David across the Jordan River before all the leaders of the other tribes had arrived, causing a dispute between them.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### “your servant,” “my lord the king,” “the king”\n\nIn several places in this chapter, people speak of themselves to King David in the third person as **your servant** to show humility. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in a humble form in the first person. In several other places, even though people are addressing David directly, they speak of him in the third person as “my lord the king” to show respect. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in a respectful form in the second person. Finally, in [19:11–12](../19/11.md), in his message to the leaders of Judah, David refers to himself regally in the third person as “the king.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in a regal form in the first person, if your language has one. (For example, in some cultures, kings and queens refer to themselves with a plural form.) (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])
19:1	q7un		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וַ⁠יֻּגַּ֖ד	1	The expression **it was declared** is a passive verbal form. If your language would not use that form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [And someone declared]

Alternate translation: [Because the people heard on that day, saying, “The king is grieved because of his son,” the victory on that day became mourning for all of the people]

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action in the text of your translation or in a footnote.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the plural form of “life.” Alternate translation: [and the lives of your sons and your daughters and the lives of your wives and the lives of your concubines]

If so, you could represent the term only once. Alternate translation: [and the lives of your sons and your daughters and your wives and your concubines]
19:6	x92x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הִגַּ֣דְתָּ	1	Joab is saying that the implication is that David has shown by his actions, not necessarily by his words, how little he values his commanders and servants.

Alternate translation: [speak encouragingly to your servants]
19:7	n6qn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-oathformula	כִּי & יָלִ֨ין אִ֤ישׁ אִתְּ⁠ךָ֙ הַ⁠לַּ֔יְלָה	1	Following the custom of his culture, Joab is swearing an oath and guaranteeing it by something that he holds sacred (**I swear by Yahweh**). He is then stating the first part of a condition (“if”) but not the second part (“then”). Use a natural way in your language to express an oath. In a context such as this, it may be natural to express the first part of the condition as a negative statement. See how you translated the similar expression in [14:19](../14/19.md). Alternate translation: [not a man will lodge with you tonight]
19:7	kf4g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	אֲשֶׁר־בָּ֣אָה עָלֶ֔י⁠ךָ	1	Joab is speaking of **trouble** as if it were a living thing that could have **come on** someone.

He had already reported this in [18:17](../18/17.md), but he mentions it again here in order to provide the background for other events he will describe that happened afterwards. Translate this sentence the same way you did there, and connect it to the story in a way that makes it clear in your language that it is describing something that was ongoing in the background. The UST models one way to do that.

You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: [that they want to return him to his house] or [that they want him to rule them again]; (2) that the **word of all of Israel** has come to David in the **house** where he is staying in Mahanaim. Alternate translation: [at the place where he is staying]; (3) that scribes have accidentally repeated the phrase **to his house** from the end of the previous sentence.

What he states as a condition (“if”) is what he is swearing to do. Use a natural way in your language to express an oath.

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action in the text of your translation or in a footnote. Alternate translation: [and to show his tribe’s support, he brought 1,000 men from Benjamin with him]

19:18	ii7j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בְּ⁠עָבְר֖⁠וֹ בַּ⁠יַּרְדֵּֽן	1	When the author says **in**, the implication is that in order to get to David quickly, Shimei waded through the water of the Jordan River. (Some interpreters suggest that the elders of Judah would instead have crossed the river on rafts and brought David across the same way.) You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [after he had waded across the Jordan]
19:19	ormh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	אַל־יַחֲשָׁב־לִ֣⁠י אֲדֹנִ⁠י֮ עָוֺן֒	1	This is a double negative, consisting of the negative particle **not** and the verb **reckon**, which in this context would be negative.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in a respectful form in the second person. See the discussion in the Introduction to this chapter of speakers using the third person either for themselves, to show humility (as Shimei does later in this verse), or for people whom they are addressing directly, to show respect. Use the appropriate forms in your language throughout the chapter. Alternate translation: [you, my lord … you, my lord the king … you]

Alternate translation: [and may you not punish your servant for the iniquity that he committed]
19:19	e5dq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	עַבְדְּ⁠ךָ֔	1	Shimei is speaking of himself in the third person as **your servant** to show humility. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in a humble form in the first person. Alternate translation: [me, your servant]

In your translation, use a natural way of introducing direct quotations in your language. It may not be necessary to represent this expression explicitly. (Shimei had addressed David rather than Abishai, so it was not Shimei personally whom Abishai **answered**. Rather, he was responding to the situation.) Alternate translation: [And Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, responded]
19:21	v8ii		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠תַ֣חַת זֹ֔את לֹ֥א יוּמַ֖ת שִׁמְעִ֑י	1	Abishai is using the question form for emphasis.

If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [I have nothing in common with you, sons of Zeruiah, that I would agree to your suggestion when it is so contrary to my interests!]

19:22	dikl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	וְ⁠לָ⁠כֶם֙ & תִֽהְיוּ	1	The word **you** is plural in both of these instances because David is addressing both Abishai and also Joab, who seems to have been nearby and supporting his brother’s suggestion. So use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
19:22	idrq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	לְ⁠שָׂטָ֑ן	1	In this verse, the word **adversary** is singular in form, but it refers to the two sons of Zeruiah, Abishai and Joab.

19:22	mf4s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	הַ⁠יּ֖וֹם & הַ⁠יּ֗וֹם & הַ⁠יּ֖וֹם	1	David is repeating the word **today** in order to emphasize that the glorious day of his restoration to the kingship should not be the occasion of an execution. It might seem that repeating this word three times would be extra information that would not be natural to express in your language. If so, you translate the word only once, expressing what it means in this context. For example, instead of saying “today” in each sentence, you could just say “on this day of celebration” in the second sentence.

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action in the text of your translation or in a footnote. Alternate translation: [And to show his grief, he had not done his feet, and he had not done his mustache, and he had not washed his clothes]
19:24	lcx6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	בְ⁠שָׁלֽוֹם	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **peace**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [peacefully] or [unharmed]

If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. See how you translated the similar expression in [14:20](../14/20.md).

If a speaker of your language would use an explicit pronoun for the same purpose, you may want to use that construction in your translation.

Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. See how you translated the similar expression in [1:7](../01/07.md).

If a speaker of your language would use an explicit pronoun for the same purpose, you may want to use that construction in your translation. If not, your language may have other ways of showing that David is making a promise to Barzillai. It may not be necessary to represent the separately stated pronoun explicitly.

20:intro	abck				0	# 2 Samuel 20 Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the story of what David did as the king of Israel and specifically how he was restored completely to his position as king after Absalom’s rebellion. It describes how a man named Sheba encouraged the Israelites not to accept David as their king again. David had appointed Amasa, who had been Absalom’s military commander, as his own commander. But when he did not take swift action against Sheba, David sent his own personal troops to pursue Sheba. They met Amasa on the way, and Joab murdered him. Joab then trapped Sheba in a city whose inhabitants killed him so that Joab would not destroy their city. That ended the rebellion, and David was firmly established as king once again.\n\nThe author indicates this by ending the chapter with a list of David’s officials ([20:23–26](../20/23.md)). This list is much like the one in [8:16–18](../08/16.md) that follows the author’s statement that “David was king over all of Israel.” See how you formatted the earlier list. It may be helpful to format this list in the same way, for example:\nNow Joab {was} over all of the army of Israel. \nBenaiah, the son of Jehoiada, {was} over the Kerethites and over the Pelethites.\nAdoniram {was} over the forced labor.\nJehoshaphat, the son of Ahilud, {was} the recorder.\nSheva {was} the scribe.\nZadok and Abiathar {were} priests.\nIra the Jairite was also a priest to David.

That is one interpretive possibility. However, since he directly addresses his fellow Israelites in the next sentence, he may well also be addressing them here, in which case it would be appropriate to use the inclusive form.

Depending on what is helpful in your language, you could use a polite way of referring to this in your language, or you could state this plainly. Alternate translation: [but he did not sleep with them]
20:3	pjma		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אַלְמְנ֥וּת חַיּֽוּת	1	The author is using as a common expression of his culture. This could mean: (1) Alternate translation: [and it was as if each was a widow, even though their husband had not died]; (2) Alternate translation: [and it was as if they were widows without a husband for the rest of their lives]
20:4	vec7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	שְׁלֹ֣שֶׁת יָמִ֑ים	1	David is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: [Have them here in three days]
20:4	jnfs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	שְׁלֹ֣שֶׁת יָמִ֑ים	1	In this culture, the current day was considered the first day, the next day was considered the second day, and the day after that was considered the third day. So David is using this phrase to refer to the day after the day he gives this command to Amasa. Express this in terms that your language and culture would naturally use. See how you translated the similar expression in [1:2](../01/02.md). Alternate translation: [Have them here within two days]
20:4	xeus		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠אַתָּ֖ה פֹּ֥ה עֲמֹֽד	1	David is stating the pronoun **you** separately, even though the verb translated as **stand** already includes this meaning. See how you translated the similar expression “you, you were” in [5:2](../05/02.md). Alternate translation: [And lead them here personally]
20:4	ixp4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠אַתָּ֖ה פֹּ֥ה עֲמֹֽד	1	David is not telling Amasa to **stand here** and not leave. He means that once Amasa has gone and summoned the Judean soldiers, he should **stand** or present himself to David along with them. The implication is that he is to present himself as their commander. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [And you, be present here as their commander] or [And it will be your responsibility to bring them here under your command]
20:5	e2sq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֶת־יְהוּדָ֑ה	1	Here, **Judah** represents the soldiers or fighting men of Judah. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [the soldiers of Judah]
20:5	soq3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	הַ⁠מּוֹעֵ֖ד	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **appointment**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [appointed time]
20:6	kaen		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	לָ֛⁠נוּ	1	By **us**, David means to include both himself and Abishai, whom he is addressing, so use the inclusive form of that word if your language marks that distinction.
20:6	u9il		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אַ֠תָּה קַ֞ח	1	See how you translated the similar expression “you, you know” in [17:20](../17/20.md). Alternate translation: [For your part, take]
20:6	i4c4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	אֶת־עַבְדֵ֤י אֲדֹנֶ֨י⁠ךָ֙	1	Even though David is addressing Abishai directly, he is speaking of himself regally in the third person as **your lord**. Your language may have a regal form that it could use here. (For example, in some languages, kings and queens speak of themselves in the plural.) You could also use the first person. Alternate translation: [my servants]
20:6	z34m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֶת־עַבְדֵ֤י אֲדֹנֶ֨י⁠ךָ֙	1	By **the servants of your lord**, David means the standing army that is under his direct command.

Because of this, he first gives Abishai the instruction to pursue Sheba, so that this will not happen. Use a connector in your language that makes it clear that avoiding this outcome is the purpose of this instruction. Alternate translation: [Otherwise, he may find fortified cities for himself and remove our eyes]
20:6	tgcd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events	מָ֥צָא ל֛⁠וֹ עָרִ֥ים בְּצֻר֖וֹת וְ⁠הִצִּ֥יל עֵינֵֽ⁠נוּ	1	David is describing one event, Sheba finding **fortified cities**, before describing another event that would precede it, Sheba figuratively removing the **eyes** of David and his servants. If it would be helpful your language, you may wish to relate these events in the order in which would happen. Alternate translation: [he remove our eyes and find fortified cities for himself]
20:6	sr8s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠הִצִּ֥יל עֵינֵֽ⁠נוּ	1	David is speaking as if Sheba might actually **remove** his **eyes** and those of his soldiers so that they would not be able to see where he had gone. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: [and we lose sight of where he has gone] or [and he go somewhere that we are not aware of]
20:7	bk6s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אַנְשֵׁ֣י יוֹאָ֔ב	1	This expression probably refers to Joab’s armor bearers or personal guard, whom the author describes as the “carriers of the weapons of Joab” in [18:15](../18/15.md). Alternate translation: [Joab’s armor bearers]
20:7	evo7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	וְ⁠הַ⁠כְּרֵתִ֥י וְ⁠הַ⁠פְּלֵתִ֖י	1	See how you translated these names in [8:18](../08/18.md) and [15:18](../15/18.md).
20:7	jqn2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠כָל־הַ⁠גִּבֹּרִ֑ים	1	These seem to be the same men whom the author describes as “the Gittites” in [15:18](../15/18.md). See what expression you used for them there.
20:7	gton		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns	אַֽחֲרָי⁠ו֙	1	The pronoun **him** refers to Abishai. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: [after Abishai]
20:7	dv5c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אַֽחֲרָי⁠ו֙	1	The author is speaking as if these soldiers were all physically traveling **after** or behind Abishai. He means that they were under his command as their leader. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [with Abishai as their commander]
20:8	cmlx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠עֲמָשָׂ֖א בָּ֣א לִ⁠פְנֵי⁠הֶ֑ם	1	Here, **to their faces** represents being in the presence of David’s soldiers. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [and Amasa met them] or [and Amasa came before them]
20:8	o0te		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וְ⁠יוֹאָ֞ב חָג֣וּר ׀ מִדּ֣⁠וֹ לְבֻשׁ֗⁠וּ ו⁠על⁠ו חֲג֥וֹר חֶ֨רֶב֙ מְצֻמֶּ֤דֶת עַל־מָתְנָי⁠ו֙ בְּ⁠תַעְרָ֔⁠הּ	1	Here, the author is providing background information to help readers understand what happens next in the story. In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
20:8	rtlj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	וְ⁠יוֹאָ֞ב חָג֣וּר ׀ מִדּ֣⁠וֹ לְבֻשׁ֗⁠וּ	1	It might seem that the expression **with his garment as his clothing** contains extra information that would not be natural to express in your language. If so, you could shorten it. Alternate translation: [Now Joab was girded with his garment]
20:8	fbif		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠יוֹאָ֞ב חָג֣וּר ׀ מִדּ֣⁠וֹ לְבֻשׁ֗⁠וּ	1	The expression **was girded** is a passive verbal form. If your language would not use that form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [Now Joab was wearing his garment]
20:8	d904		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מִדּ֣⁠וֹ	1	The author assumes that his readers will know that by **garment**, he means an article of clothing that was designed for soldiers to wear under armor. If you have already translated the book of 1 Samuel, see how you translated the similar expression in [1 Samuel 17:38](../../1sa/17/38.md). Alternate translation: [with his military tunic]
20:8	q4zv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	ו⁠על⁠ו חֲג֥וֹר חֶ֨רֶב֙ מְצֻמֶּ֤דֶת עַל־מָתְנָי⁠ו֙ בְּ⁠תַעְרָ֔⁠הּ	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you may want to put the information about **the sword** with the information about **its sheath**. Alternate translation: [and on him a belt was strapped around his waist holding a sword in its sheath]
20:8	lx8m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	חֶ֨רֶב֙	1	Since Joab was able to hold this **sword** in his hand without Amasa knowing it was there, it was probably a short sword. Your language may have a term for such a weapon that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: [a dagger]
20:8	o731		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠ה֥וּא יָצָ֖א וַ⁠תִּפֹּֽל	1	The author is stating the pronoun **he** separately, even though the verb translated as **he went out** already includes this meaning. He is doing that to emphasize that these two actions occurred at the same time. If a speaker of your language would use an explicit pronoun for this same purpose, you may want to use that construction in your translation. If not, your language may have other ways of showing that the author is describing simultaneous actions. Alternate translation: [And as he went out, it fell] or [And he made it fall as he went out]
20:8	fa3g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠ה֥וּא יָצָ֖א	1	The author means that Joab **went out** from the group of soldiers he was in and approached Amasa and the group of soldiers that he was leading. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [And he stepped forward]
20:8	r2bg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וַ⁠תִּפֹּֽל	1	The author is speaking of this sword or dagger as if it had been a living thing that **fell** on its own. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [and he let it fall]
20:8	h08d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠תִּפֹּֽל	1	This could mean: (1) that the sword **fell** secretly into Joab’s hand in a way that he contrived. Alternate translation: [and it fell secretly into his hand]; (2) that the sword **fell** to the ground without Amasa noticing and Joab picked it up secretly. Alternate translation: [and it fell unseen to the ground, where Joab secretly picked it up]
20:9	cs27		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	הֲ⁠שָׁל֥וֹם אַתָּ֖ה	1	Joab is addressing Amasa with a polite greeting of his culture. (The term **Peace** has the sense of “well-being” here.) Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: [How are you]
20:9	c8zg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	אָחִ֑⁠י	1	This could mean: (1) that Joab is using the term **brother** to describe the close family relationship that he and Amasa have. The narrative indicates elsewhere that Joab’s mother and Amasa’s mother were sisters. Your language may have its own term or expression for this relationship. Alternate translation: [my cousin]; (2) that Joab is using the term **brother** as a term of endearment. Alternate translation: [my friend]

If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [And Joab held onto the beard of Amasa with his right hand so that he could kiss him]
20:9	h0k6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	לִ⁠נְשָׁק־לֽ⁠וֹ	1	Kissing Amasa was a symbolic action by which Joab pretended to show friendship and respect. He actually intended to get close to Amasa so he could kill him. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action in the text of your translation or in a footnote. Alternate translation: [to greet him with a kiss] or [to pretend friendship by giving him a kiss]
20:10	m4ew		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns	וַ⁠יַּכֵּ⁠הוּ֩ בָ֨⁠הּ אֶל־הַ⁠חֹ֜מֶשׁ וַ⁠יִּשְׁפֹּ֨ךְ מֵעָ֥י⁠ו אַ֛רְצָ⁠ה וְ⁠לֹא־שָׁ֥נָה ל֖⁠וֹ וַ⁠יָּמֹ֑ת	1	If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use names instead of pronouns in order to clarify who did what to whom here.

20:10	stdf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠לֹא־שָׁ֥נָה ל֖⁠וֹ	1	The author is using the phrase **he did not do again to him** as a common expression of his culture to mean that Joab did not repeat the action of stabbing Amasa. If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [and he did not stab him a second time]
20:11	kqpf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns	עָלָ֔י⁠ו	1	The pronoun **him** refers to Amasa. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: [beside Amasa]
20:11	afcd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	אַחֲרֵ֥י יוֹאָֽב	1	The man is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: [go after Joab] or [follow Joab in pursuit of Sheba]
20:12	g9b2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הָ⁠אִ֜ישׁ	1	The author assumes that his readers will know that by **the man**, he means the “man from the young man of Joab” whom he describes in the previous verse. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [the man from the young men of Joab]
20:12	bh2p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֣ר רָאָ֔ה כָּל־הַ⁠בָּ֥א עָלָ֖י⁠ו וְ⁠עָמָֽד	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you may want to put the information that soldiers **stood** before the information that this happened as they were **coming** to where Amasa was. Alternate translation: [because he saw that everyone stopped when they came to him]
20:12	h1ur		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֣ר רָאָ֔ה כָּל־הַ⁠בָּ֥א עָלָ֖י⁠ו וְ⁠עָמָֽד	1	It might seem that this statement provides extra information that would not be natural to express in your language, since it basically repeats what the author says in the first part of the verse. If so, you could present this information only once. The UST models one way to do that.
20:14	md8s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns	וַֽ⁠יַּעֲבֹ֞ר בְּ⁠כָל	1	The pronoun **he** refers to Sheba. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: [And Sheba passed through]
20:14	jdoi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	בְּ⁠כָל־שִׁבְטֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֗ל	1	The author says **all of the tribes of Israel** as an overstatement for emphasis. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different way to express the emphasis. Alternate translation: [the territory of Israel all the way to its northern boundary]
20:14	ec5z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	אָבֵ֛לָ⁠ה וּ⁠בֵ֥ית מַעֲכָ֖ה	1	The phrase **Abel and Beth Maacah** identifies a single place. The name **Beth Maacah** tells which specific city of **Abel** this was, since there were several cities by that name in Israel. The author uses the expression “Abel Beth Maacah” in the next verse, and you may wish to use that name here as well. You could also reflect how the author is identifying this city. Alternate translation: [to the city of Abel, that is, the one in Beth Maacah]
20:14	nudr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וְ⁠כָל־הַ⁠בֵּרִ֑ים & וַיִּקָּ֣הֲל֔וּ וַ⁠יָּבֹ֖אוּ אַף־אַחֲרָֽי⁠ו	1	The author is providing background information to help readers understand what happens next in the story.

20:14	p4r5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	וְ⁠כָל־הַ⁠בֵּרִ֑ים	1	The author says **all of the Berites** as a generalization. He is referring specifically to the fighting men among the Berites.

They may have supported and accompanied Sheba since he was from their tribe. Alternate translation: [the soldiers from the area of Beroth]; (2) some other people group in northern Israel that is otherwise unknown. Alternate translation: [the soldiers of the Berite people group]
20:14	tg04		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יָּבֹ֖אוּ אַף־אַחֲרָֽי⁠ו	1	The author is speaking as if the Berites actually **came after** their leader, Sheba, in the sense of physically following behind him. He means that they joined his cause and accepted his leadership. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [and they were also following him as their leader]
20:15	xz81		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns	וַ⁠יָּבֹ֜אוּ	1	The pronoun **they** refers to Joab and his soldiers. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state this explicitly. Alternate translation: [And Joab and his soldiers came]

If your readers would not be familiar with what a rampart is, you could use the name of a similar thing that your readers would recognize, or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: [against the outer wall]
20:16	dru1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	שִׁמְע֤וּ שִׁמְעוּ֙	1	The woman is repeating the verb **Listen** in order to intensify her expression of the idea that it conveys.

Alternate translation: [Do listen]
20:16	s8cz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	אִמְרוּ־נָ֣א אֶל־יוֹאָ֔ב קְרַ֣ב עַד־הֵ֔נָּה וַ⁠אֲדַבְּרָ֖ה אֵלֶֽי⁠ךָ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation.

20:17	nlmx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	שְׁמַע֙	1	This is an imperative, but it communicates a polite request rather than a command. Use a form in your language that communicates a polite request. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: [Please hear]

20:19	ojn4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	תְבַלַּ֖ע	1	The wise woman is speaking as if Joab and his soldiers would actually **devour** or eat up Abel Beth Maacah. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [will you destroy]
20:19	kmm2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	נַחֲלַ֥ת יְהוָֽה	1	The woman is speaking of the people of Israel as if they were something that Yahweh had inherited as a lasting possession. She is referring to the Israelites as the people who belong to Yahweh perpetually. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. See how you translated the similar expression in [14:16](../14/16.md). Alternate translation: [so many of the people of Israel]
20:20	bw9k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יַּ֥עַן יוֹאָ֖ב וַ⁠יֹּאמַ֑ר	1	The expression **and said** introduces a direct quotation.

Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. If you have already translated the book of 1 Samuel, see how you translated the similar expression in [1 Samuel 2:30](../../1sa/02/30.md). Alternate translation: [Far be it, far be it from me to devour or to destroy!]
20:20	fykm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	חָלִ֤ילָ⁠ה חָלִ֨ילָ⁠ה֙ לִ֔⁠י	1	Joab is repeating the word **Profane** in order to intensify his expression of the idea that it conveys. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the intensification. Alternate translation: [Absolutely profane to me] or [Be it far away from me]

21:intro	abcl				0	# 2 Samuel 21 Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThe author seems to conclude his continuous account of what David did as king of Israel at the end of [chapter 20](../20/01.md). Chapters 21–24 then provide supplemental information. It is not clear at what point in David’s reign the events they describe happened. These chapters are composed of six parts. Parts one and six match, parts two and five match, and parts three and four match. (This kind of pattern is called a “chiasm,” and Hebrew writers considered it to be elegant.)\n\n21:1–14 A famine, after which “God was entreated for the land.”\n21:15–22 An account of David’s mighty men\n22:1–51 A song by David about Yahweh’s deliverance\n23:1–7 A song by David about what a good ruler is like\n23:8–39 An account of David’s mighty men\n\nIn your translation, you may wish to put a break between [21:14](../21/14.md) and [21:15](../21/15.md) to show that this chapter contains two of the six parts of the supplemental information at the end of the book.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Famine caused by a broken oath\n\nWhen Israel first conquered the land, they promised not to kill the people of Gibeon. When Saul tried to kill them all, God caused a famine in Israel. David made amends with the people of Gideon and the famine ended. David also kept his vow to Jonathan’s sons. This helps to show the wisdom of king David. Although these people were not Israelites, they believed in Yahweh. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/oath]], and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/wise]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/believe]])\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### “struck”\n\nIn several places in this chapter, the author uses the term “struck” to mean “killed.” See the discussion in the Introduction to 1 Samuel of this usage and see how you have been translating the term with this meaning throughout the book.\n\n### “Rapha”\n\nIn [21:16–22](../21/16.md), the author refers several times to “the children of Rapha” or says that someone was “born to Rapha.” He probably means that they were descendants of a people group whose members were very tall. One way to represent the name Rapha would be to use the general term “giant.”
21:1	ce37		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֣י רָעָב֩ בִּ⁠ימֵ֨י דָוִ֜ד	1	The author is using the word translated **Now** to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event. Alternate translation: [At another time] or [During one period]
21:1	uc60		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	שָׁלֹ֣שׁ שָׁנִ֗ים שָׁנָה֙ אַחֲרֵ֣י שָׁנָ֔ה	1	The author is using the phrase **three years, year after year** as a common expression of his culture to mean “for three consecutive years.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [three years in a row] or [for three consecutive years]
21:1	myes		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יְבַקֵּ֥שׁ דָּוִ֖ד אֶת־פְּנֵ֣י יְהוָ֑ה	1	The author is using the phrase **sought the face of** as a common expression in of his culture to mean “prayed to” or “asked guidance from.” In this case, David was praying to Yahweh about the cause of the famine. If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [And David inquired of Yahweh]
21:1	omdw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	אֶל־שָׁאוּל֙ וְ⁠אֶל־בֵּ֣ית הַ⁠דָּמִ֔ים עַל־אֲשֶׁר־הֵמִ֖ית אֶת־הַ⁠גִּבְעֹנִֽים	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: [Because Saul killed the Gibeonites, to him and to the house is blood]
21:1	fctt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠אֶל־בֵּ֣ית	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [6:11](../06/11.md). Alternate translation: [and to his household]

21:2	ptri		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	לַ⁠גִּבְעֹנִ֖ים	1	The author is saying **the Gibeonites** as a generalization. He does not mean that David spoke with the entire people group, but with some representatives of it. Alternate translation: [representatives of the Gibeonites]
21:2	ubq0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וְ⁠הַ⁠גִּבְעֹנִ֞ים לֹ֣א מִ⁠בְּנֵ֧י יִשְׂרָאֵ֣ל	1	Here, the author is providing background information to help readers understand what happens next in the story. In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
21:2	kzyh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וּ⁠בְנֵ֤י יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ נִשְׁבְּע֣וּ לָ⁠הֶ֔ם	1	The author assumes that readers will know that the Israelites had sworn to protect the Gibeonites and not kill them, as recorded in [Joshua 9](../../jos/09/01.md). You could say that explicitly if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [And the sons of Israel had sworn to them that they would spare their lives]
21:2	v7wo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מִ⁠בְּנֵ֧י יִשְׂרָאֵ֣ל & לִ⁠בְנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל וִ⁠יהוּדָֽה	1	The author is speaking as if the people of Israel and Judah were actually the **sons** of the patriarch Jacob, who was also known as Israel, and the patriarch Judah. If you have already translated the book of 1 Samuel, see how you translated the similar expression in [1 Samuel 2:28](../../1sa/02/28.md). Alternate translation: [the Israelites … the Israelites and Judeans]
21:2	f2ww		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	הָ⁠אֱמֹרִ֔י	1	The author is not referring to a specific **Amorite**. He means Amorites in general. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use an expression that would be more natural in your language. Alternate translation: [the Amorites]
21:2	ztpj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לְ⁠הַכֹּתָ֔⁠ם	1	See the discussion in the Introduction to this chapter of the term **strike** and its past form “struck,” which mean “kill” or “killed” here and in several other places in the chapter. Alternate translation: [to kill them]
21:3	ma6i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	מָ֥ה אֶעֱשֶׂ֖ה לָ⁠כֶ֑ם וּ⁠בַ⁠מָּ֣ה אֲכַפֵּ֔ר	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine them and express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: [How can I thoroughly make amends to you] or [What can I possibly do to make things right with you]
21:3	g91o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	וּ⁠בָרְכ֖וּ	1	This is an imperative, but David is using it to confirm the response he could expect from the Gibeonites if he performed the actions he has just described. Use a form in your language that indicates this. Alternate translation: [that you would then bless]
21:3	nmp7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֶת־נַחֲלַ֥ת יְהוָֽה	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [14:16](../14/16.md). Alternate translation: [Yahweh’s people, Israel]

If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [We will not accept any form of payment as compensation from Saul or from his house]
21:4	migd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	עִם־שָׁא֣וּל וְ⁠עִם־בֵּית֔⁠וֹ	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [1:12](../01/12.md). Alternate translation: [with Saul, that is, with his descendants]
21:4	h7vz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠אֵֽין־לָ֥⁠נוּ אִ֖ישׁ לְ⁠הָמִ֣ית בְּ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל	1	The Gibeonites could mean: (1) that there is not a **man** (that is, there is no one) in their people group who is authorized **to kill** anyone **in Israel**. In other words, since they apparently do not have the right to execute Israelites who may have committed capital crimes against them, they are indirectly introducing a request that David execute some of Saul’s descendants. (The next sentence shows that David recognizes they are asking something of him.) Alternate translation: [And we are not allowed to punish any Israelites by executing them]; (2) that the Gibeonites are making a generalization and they expect David to understand that it includes an exception. Alternate translation: [And we do not want to kill anyone in Israel except some of Saul’s descendants to avenge his crime against us]
21:5	kf9a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events	אֲשֶׁ֣ר כִּלָּ֔⁠נוּ וַ⁠אֲשֶׁ֖ר דִּמָּה־לָ֑⁠נוּ נִשְׁמַ֕דְנוּ מֵֽ⁠הִתְיַצֵּ֖ב בְּ⁠כָל־גְּבֻ֥ל יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	The Gibeonites are describing one event before describing another event that preceded it. If it would be helpful your language, you may wish to relate these events in the order in which they happened, as in the UST. Alternate translation: [who intended against us that we should be destroyed from stationing ourselves in all of the border of Israel and who then ended us]
21:5	e3yf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	נִשְׁמַ֕דְנוּ	1	The expression **we should be destroyed** is a passive verbal form. If your language would not use that form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [to destroy us]
21:5	wt2m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מֵֽ⁠הִתְיַצֵּ֖ב	1	The Gibeonites are using the common expression of their culture, **from stationing ourselves in all of the border of Israel**, to mean “from living anywhere in the territory of Israel.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [from living anywhere]
21:5	k2h2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	גְּבֻ֥ל יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	Here, **border** represents the territory of Israel, since that territory is defined by its border. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [the territory of Israel]
21:6	tkmp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	ינתן־לָ֜⁠נוּ שִׁבְעָ֤ה אֲנָשִׁים֙ מִ⁠בָּנָ֔י⁠ו וְ⁠הוֹקַֽעֲנוּ⁠ם֙	1	The Gibeonites’ request to **hang** Saul’s descendants was a symbolic action by which they sought to avenge themselves on Saul’s family and restore justice for the harm he had done to them. In this culture, **seven** was a number symbolic of completeness. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action in the text of your translation or in a footnote. Alternate translation: [let seven men from his sons be given to us, and we will execute them as a just consequence of Saul’s crime against us]
21:6	bnp8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ינתן־לָ֜⁠נוּ שִׁבְעָ֤ה אֲנָשִׁים֙ מִ⁠בָּנָ֔י⁠ו	1	The expression **be given to us** is a passive verbal form. If your language would not use that form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [give us seven men from his sons]
21:6	ycv7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מִ⁠בָּנָ֔י⁠ו	1	Here, the Gibeonites are speaking as if Saul’s **sons** were actually sons he had personally fathered. They mean his descendants, including grandsons and other male relatives. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [from his male descendants]
21:6	qlqb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לַֽ⁠יהוָ֔ה	1	The Gibeonites are using the common expression of their culture **before Yahweh** to mean that Yahweh would witness their act of justice. If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [where Yahweh can see that justice has been done]
21:6	ewn6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	בְּחִ֣יר יְהוָ֑ה	1	The Gibeonites are using the adjective **chosen** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this adjective with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: [the one whom Yahweh chose to be king]
21:6	ef62		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אֲנִ֥י אֶתֵּֽן	1	David is stating the pronoun **I** separately, even though the verb translated as **I will give** already includes this meaning. He is doing that because he is making a promise to the Gibeonites. If a speaker of your language would use an explicit pronoun for the same purpose, you may want to use that construction in your translation. If not, your language may have other ways of showing that David is making a promise. It may not be necessary to represent the separately stated pronoun explicitly. Alternate translation: [I promise that I will give]
21:6	syte		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	אֲנִ֥י אֶתֵּֽן	1	David is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: [I promise that I will give them to you]
21:7	enwv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	שְׁבֻעַ֤ת יְהוָה֙	1	The author is using this possessive form to describe an **oath** that David swore to Jonathan by **Yahweh**. If a speaker of your language would not use a possessive form for this, you could express this idea in another way. This refers to the oath that Jonathan had David swear to him by Yahweh, as described in [1 Samuel 20:14–16](../../1sa/20/14.md), that he would not harm his descendants. Alternate translation: [the oath sworn in the name of Yahweh]
21:8	etnc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	מִיכַ֣ל	1	The traditional Hebrew text reads “Michal.” The ULT follows that reading. Some other Hebrew manuscripts and some manuscripts of the Septuagint (an ancient Greek translation) read “Merab.” That was probably the original reading, since [1 Samuel 18:19](../18/19.md) describes how it was Merab who married **Adriel** of Meholah, while the author says in [6:23](../06/23.md) that Michal had no children. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
21:9	hwxk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	בְּ⁠יַ֣ד הַ⁠גִּבְעֹנִ֗ים	1	In this verse, the word **hand** is singular in form, but it refers to all Gibeonites as a group. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the plural form of “hand.” Alternate translation: [into the hands of the Gibeonites]
21:9	rna0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠יַ֣ד הַ⁠גִּבְעֹנִ֗ים	1	Here, **hand** represents control or custody. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [into the custody of the Gibeonites]
21:9	dz60		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י יְהוָ֔ה	1	Here, **to the face of** represents being in the presence of Yahweh. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [in the presence of Yahweh]
21:9	cr3h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יִּפְּל֥וּ שְׁבַעְתָּ֖ם	1	Here, **fell** represents “died.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [and the seven of them died]
21:9	ris0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ו⁠הם הֻמְת֜וּ	1	The author is stating the pronoun **they** separately, even though the verb translated as **they were killed** already includes this meaning. He is doing that in order to introduce background information. If a speaker of your language would use an explicit pronoun for this same purpose, you may want to use that construction in your translation. If not, your language may have other ways of showing that the author is introducing background information. Alternate translation: [Now they were killed]
21:9	s004		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ו⁠הם הֻמְת֜וּ	1	The expression **were killed** is a passive verbal form. If your language would not use that form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

21:9	fqji		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	בִּ⁠ימֵ֤י קָצִיר֙ בָּ⁠רִ֣אשֹׁנִ֔ים	1	It might seem that the expression **in the days of the harvest, in the first** contains extra information that would not be natural to express in your language. If so, you could shorten it. Alternate translation: [in the first days of the harvest]
21:9	kwoz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בִּ⁠ימֵ֤י קָצִיר֙ בָּ⁠רִ֣אשֹׁנִ֔ים	1	Here the term **days** represents a certain time, since time is made up of days. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [at the start of the harvest time]
21:9	n1tn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	בָּ⁠רִ֣אשֹׁנִ֔ים	1	The author is using the adjective **first** as a noun to mean a certain kind of day. The ULT shows that by supplying the term **days**. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this adjective with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: [in the first part]
21:9	shmj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	בָּ⁠רִ֣אשֹׁנִ֔ים	1	If your language would not represent a number in a form such as ** first**, you could represent this number in a form that your language would use or with an equivalent term. Alternate translation: [in the starting days]
21:10	gm32		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠תַּטֵּ֨⁠הוּ לָ֤⁠הּ אֶל־הַ⁠צּוּר֙	1	The author assumes that readers will know that Rizpah spread this sackcloth against a rock to make a shelter for herself while she guarded the bodies of her male relatives. You could say that explicitly if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [and she spread it for herself against a rock to make a shelter for herself]
21:10	d3cb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	מִ⁠תְּחִלַּ֣ת קָצִ֔יר	1	The author is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

If you need to say who does the action, the context indicates that it was Yahweh. Alternate translation: [rain fell on them] or [Yahweh poured rain on them]

Alternate translation: [And the Israelites were able to entreat God for the land after this]
21:14	iiuo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אַֽחֲרֵי־כֵֽן	1	By **this**, the author means that God responded to prayers for the land only after the Gibeonites had been avenged and Saul’s descendants had been properly buried.

21:16	cp6x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בִּ⁠ילִידֵ֣י הָ⁠רָפָ֗ה	1	Here, the author is speaking of the **children of Rapha** as if Rapha were actually their physical father. He means they were among the descendants of Rapha, the group of giants called Raphaites. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly, here and in [verses 18](../21/18.md), [20](../21/20.md), and [22](../21/22.md).

21:16	v5ro		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bweight	שְׁלֹ֤שׁ מֵאוֹת֙ & נְחֹ֔שֶׁת	1	These 300 **shekels of bronze** equaled about 3 ½ kilograms or nearly 8 pounds. In your translation, you could use the ancient measurement and spell the word “shekel” the way it sounds in your language. You could also use the metric measurement given in the UST or use the measurement that your language and culture customarily use. Alternatively, you could use the ancient measurement and put a modern measurement in parentheses in the text or in a footnote.

21:16	zz4x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	חֲדָשָׁ֑ה	1	The traditional Hebrew text simply says “new.” The ULT seeks to show what that reading might mean. Some versions are more specific and say “a new sword” or “new armor.” The Septuagint (an ancient Greek translation) has a term that means “a club” or “a mace” (a club with an iron coating or head). This suggests that the original text could have named some rare but formidable weapon whose name was not preserved exactly in the traditional text. (The context suggests that Ishbi Benob believed he could kill David because he had such a weapon.) If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses.

In some languages, that might help emphasize the strength and courage of Elhanan, which the author wishes to highlight here. Alternate translation: [fought Goliath the Gittite.

The parallel passage in [1 Chronicles 20:5](../../1ch/20/05.md) reads “Jair.” That may have been the original reading, since the word “oregim” means “weavers” and occurs later in the verse. It may have accidentally been copied here. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses.

If you have already translated the book of 1 Samuel, see how you translated the similar expression in [1 Samuel 17:7](../../1sa/17/07.md). Alternate translation: [was like the thick, strong beam on which weavers hang their fabric]

22:intro	abcm				0	# 2 Samuel 22 Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the supplemental information about David’s reign as king of Israel that the author provides at the end of the book. It is the third part of that information, a song by David about Yahweh’s deliverance.\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the words of this song in [22:2–51](../22/02.md).\n\nThis song is also recorded in the Bible as [Psalm 18](../../psa/018/001.md). That shows that the people of Israel used it in their own worship after David had composed and sung it.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Hebrew poetry\n\nThe verses of this song by David continually present two phrases that mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers in many cases by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. If you do that, it may be clearer in your language to connect the phrases with a word other than “and” in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. But you may find that in some cases it is appropriate to combine the two phrases. For example:\n\n  - both phrases\n\n[22:24](../22/24.md) And I have been blameless toward him, \n and I have kept myself from my iniquity.\n“And I have been blameless toward him, \n yes, I have kept myself from my iniquity.”\n\n[22:22](../22/22.md) For I have kept the ways of Yahweh, \n and I have not been wicked from my God.\n“For I have kept the ways of Yahweh, \n no, I have not been wicked from my God.”\n\n  - combined into one\n\n[22:7](../22/07.md) In my distress I called {to} Yahweh, \n and to my God I called\n“In my distress I called out to Yahweh, my God”\n\n### Extended metaphor\n\nIn [verses 8–15](../22/08.md), David describes Yahweh coming to help him as being like the greatest natural forces that people of his culture knew, which were an earthquake ([verse 8](../22/08.md)), a volcano ([verse 9](../22/09.md)), and a thunderstorm ([verses 10–15](../22/10.md)). He describes each of these forces in poetic language. In other words, after stating his topic, which is how Yahweh delivered him ([verse 7](../22/07.md)), David then depicts it with multiple images that communicate multiple ideas. Think about how you might show in your translation that [verses 8–15](../22/08.md), while describing three different things, all illustrate the same topic.

Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that would be natural for introducing a long quotation of someone’s writing with the story of that person’s life. Alternate translation: [Here are the words to a song that David sang to Yahweh]
22:1	fl18		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠יוֹם֩	1	David is using the term **day** to refer to a specific time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [at the time when]

22:2	wd4o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	יְהוָ֛ה סַֽלְעִ֥⁠י וּ⁠מְצֻדָתִ֖⁠י	1	The terms **rock** and **stronghold** mean similar things. David is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: [Yahweh is the place where I go for safety]
22:2	iizo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יְהוָ֛ה סַֽלְעִ֥⁠י וּ⁠מְצֻדָתִ֖⁠י	1	David is speaking here of **Yahweh** as if he were a **rock** and a **stronghold**. He means that Yahweh provides safety and protection for him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [Yahweh is the one who keeps me safe]
22:2	anwf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	וּ⁠מְפַלְטִ⁠י־לִֽ⁠י	1	David is saying both **my** and **mine** in order to intensify his expression of the idea that Yahweh is his **deliverer**. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the intensification. Alternate translation: [and my sure deliverer]
22:3	oqd1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	אֱלֹהֵ֥י צוּרִ֖⁠י	1	David is using the possessive form to describe **God** as characterized by the quality he represents with the image of a **rock**.

22:3	tyo7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠קֶ֣רֶן יִשְׁעִ֗⁠י	1	David is speaking of God’s power to save him as if it were a powerful **horn** of an animal. A horn was a symbol of strength in ancient Israelite culture because animals use their horns as weapons. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [and the one who saves my by his power]

Hebrew had more synonyms for these ideas than some other languages may have. It may be necessary for you to use the same words rather than different ones. However, if you do have a variety of terms for these ideas, it would be appropriate to use different words here than were used in the previous ones.
22:3	lr7p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	מִשְׂגַּבִּ⁠י֙ וּ⁠מְנוּסִ֔⁠י	1	The terms **stronghold** and **refuge** mean similar things. David is using the two terms together for emphasis.

The UST models one way to use the second person consistently. If you took the other approach, you could use the third person here and later in the song. Alternate translation: [he saves me from violence]
22:3	gmtt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	מֵ⁠חָמָ֖ס תֹּשִׁעֵֽ⁠נִי	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **violence**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [you keep violent people from harming me]
22:4	ax92		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	מְהֻלָּ֖ל אֶקְרָ֣א יְהוָ֑ה	1	The expression **being praised** is a passive verbal form.

22:8	to04		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ו⁠תגעש & הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ & וַ⁠יִּֽתְגָּעֲשׁ֖וּ	1	The terms that the ULT translates as **shook** and **shook themselves** represent two different verbs in the original. Hebrew had more synonyms for this idea, which David also expresses with the verbs translated as **trembled** and **quaked**, than some other languages may have. It may be necessary for you to use the same words rather than different ones. However, if you do have a variety of terms for this, it would be appropriate to use different words for **shook** and **shook themselves**.

A volcano is an opening in the earth through which gases, smoke-like ash, and very hot, liquid rock come out. The rock can cool and build up over time to form a hill or mountain. David is describing the opening at the top of a volcano, from which **Smoke** and **fire** and **Coals** come out, as if it were the **nose** and **mouth** of the volcano. If your readers would be familiar with what a volcano is, you could express in your translation how David is using a volcano as an image to describe Yahweh’s power. If your readers would not be familiar with what a volcano is, you could describe in more general terms how Yahweh’s power is like fire and smoke.
22:9	riv7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	תֹּאכֵ֑ל	1	David is speaking of the fire that comes from a volcano, which represents God here, as if it were a wild animal that **devoured** its prey.

22:13	c8h0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	נֶגְדּ֑⁠וֹ	1	Here, **before him** represents being in God’s presence. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [in his presence]
22:13	wxk8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בָּעֲר֖וּ גַּחֲלֵי־אֵֽשׁ	1	Since David says that these **coals of fire** came **From** this **brightness**, he does not mean that they **burned** in place where they were.

22:15	qhjc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pronouns	וַ⁠יְפִיצֵ֑⁠ם & ו⁠יהמ⁠ם	1	The pronoun **them** refers in each instance to David’s enemies. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: [and he scattered my enemies … and he panicked those enemies]

Alternate translation: [out of great trouble]

22:41	nkln		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	עֹ֑רֶף	1	In this verse, the word **back** is singular in form, but it refers to all the enemies as a group.

22:47	w032		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	חַי־יְהוָ֖ה	1	David is using a phrase that expresses a strong feeling, joy.

If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.

23:intro	abcn				0	# 2 Samuel 23 Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the supplemental information about David’s reign as king of Israel that the author provides at the end of the book. It presents the fourth and fifth parts of that information, a song that presents David’s last words and a description of his greatest warriors.\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [23:2–7](../23/02.md).\n\n2 Samuel [23:8–39](../23/08.md) is a list of the famous people in David’s army along with some of the special deeds some of them did. Consider how you have been presenting the lists in 2 Samuel in your translation and how you might present the list in [verses 24–29](../23/24.md) similarly. You may choose to put one name, rather than two, on each line.
23:1	jsh4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	נְאֻ֧ם דָּוִ֣ד בֶּן־יִשַׁ֗י וּ⁠נְאֻ֤ם הַ⁠גֶּ֨בֶר֙ הֻ֣קַם עָ֔ל	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. It may be clearer in your language to connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Review from your work on [chapter 22](../22/01.md) how you decided as a team to represent Hebrew poetry in your translation. Alternate translation: [An oracle of David the son of Jesse, yes, an oracle of the man raised to height] or [An oracle of David the son of Jesse, who was a man raised to height]
23:1	v57k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	הַ⁠גֶּ֨בֶר֙ הֻ֣קַם עָ֔ל	1	The expression **raised** is a passive verbal form.

See the discussion in the Introduction to [chapter 22](../22/01.md) of how Hebrew poetry was based on the repetition of words, phrases, and ideas. Recall how you decided as a team represent Hebrew poetry in your translation. Alternate translation: [The Spirit of Yahweh spoke by me, yes, his word was on my tongue] or [The Spirit of Yahweh gave me the words to speak for him]
23:2	e9bg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וּ⁠מִלָּת֖⁠וֹ עַל־לְשׁוֹנִֽ⁠י	1	David is using the term **word** to represent what he said by using words. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [and I spoke his word]

23:3	vtrh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	בָּ⁠אָדָ֔ם	1	Here the masculine term **man** has a generic sense that includes both men and women.

23:4	alg6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִ⁠נֹּ֥גַהּ	1	Here, **brightness** represents sunshine or sunlight. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [from sunshine]

23:5	tpyo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בֵּיתִ֖⁠י	1	As in [1:12](../01/12.md) and similar contexts, **house** here means all the people descended from a particular person. It envisions them as if they were one household living together. In this specific context, David is using the term **house** to mean his dynasty, his royal line of descendants who would rule after him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [my royal dynasty]
23:5	i4fx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	כִּי֩ & שָׂ֣ם	1	Here the word **For** introduces not a reason but an explanation. Use a connecting word or phrase that would indicate this in your language. Alternate translation: [I say this because he has made]

23:6	dq7h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	וּ⁠בְלִיַּ֕עַל	1	The author is using the adjective **wicked** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person.

23:6	r8ct		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כְּ⁠ק֥וֹץ	1	The point of this comparison is that just as **thorns** are worthless and thrown away, so are the **wicked**.

Alternate translation: [that people throw away because it hurts to hold it in their hands]
23:6	fdyr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	לֹ֥א & יִקָּֽחוּ	1	Here the author is using the pronoun **they** in a general sense, not to refer to specific people.

23:7	d2qi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠עֵ֣ץ חֲנִ֑ית	1	Here, **wood of a spear** represents the shaft or handle of a spear. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [or the shaft of a spear]
23:7	td9q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	שָׂר֥וֹף יִשָּׂרְפ֖וּ	1	The author is repeating forms of the verb **burned** in order to intensify his expression of the idea that it conveys.

Alternate translation: [And they will surely be burned]
23:7	uqoz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	שָׂר֥וֹף יִשָּׂרְפ֖וּ	1	The expression **burning, they will be burned** is a passive verbal form.

23:9	n325		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	שָׁ֣ם	1	The author assumes that his readers will know that by **there**, he means Pas Dammim, a place where the Israelites and Philistines frequently fought battles. The parallel passage in [1 Chronicles 11:13](../../1ch/11/13.md) states the name of this place explicitly, and you could do the same in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers.

23:9	bu04		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַֽ⁠יַּעֲל֖וּ אִ֥ישׁ יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	By **went up**, the author means the Israelite soldiers retreated to higher ground away from the battle.

23:12	aohr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יַּ֖ךְ אֶת־פְּלִשְׁתִּ֑ים	1	By **struck**, the author means in this context that he killed Philistine soldiers in battle.

Alternate translation: [and he killed the Philistines]
23:13	dkki		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	רֹ֗אשׁ	1	The author is using the image of the **head** to mean a leader or chief. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [chief]

23:13	eirm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	אֶל־קָצִיר֙	1	The traditional Hebrew text reads “the harvest.” The ULT follows that reading. The parallel passage in [1 Chronicles 11:15](../../1ch/11/15.md) reads “the rock.” That may have been the original reading, since it suits the grammar and context better and involves a difference of only one letter. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.

If so, you could say “then” in only one part of the verse, wherever it would be more natural in your language to say that.
23:15	l8eg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	וַ⁠יִּתְאַוֶּ֥ה דָוִ֖ד	1	Since what David says in the rest of the verse indicates what he **desired**, you do not need to explain that here at the beginning of the verse by saying something such as, “And David desired to have something to drink.”
23:15	oeud		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מִ֚י יַשְׁקֵ֣⁠נִי מַ֔יִם מִ⁠בֹּ֥אר בֵּֽית־לֶ֖חֶם אֲשֶׁ֥ר בַּ⁠שָּֽׁעַר	1	David is using the question form to express his strong desire for water from the well. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [I wish that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem that {is} at the gate!]
23:15	qgdi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	מַ֔יִם	1	The term for **water** is always plural in Hebrew. Different languages may need to use a singular form in certain contexts, as the ULT does here and elsewhere. If your language would use a plural form in these contexts, it would be appropriate to do that in your translation.
23:16	uhbt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וַ⁠יַּסֵּ֥ךְ אֹתָ֖⁠ם לַֽ⁠יהוָֽה	1	The pouring out of the water was a symbolic action by which David showed that this water, obtained at great risk by his men, was too precious to drink, and it deserved to be offered to Yahweh instead. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action in the text of your translation or in a footnote. Alternate translation: [and he offered it as a sacrifice to Yahweh] or [and he poured it out on the ground as an offering to Yahweh]

Alternate translation: [the blood of the men who risked their lives to get it]
23:17	x6f9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הֲ⁠דַ֤ם הָֽ⁠אֲנָשִׁים֙ הַ⁠הֹלְכִ֣ים בְּ⁠נַפְשׁוֹתָ֔⁠ם	1	David is speaking as if the water that the men brought were actually their **blood**. He means that the water represents the danger into which these men put their lives to get it for him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [this water that I am pouring out, since the blood of these men could just as easily have been poured out when they risked their lives to get it]
23:17	nxuo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-endofstory	אֵ֣לֶּה עָשׂ֔וּ שְׁלֹ֖שֶׁת הַ⁠גִּבֹּרִֽים	1	The author is offering a summary of the stories he has just related. This signals the end of this section about these **three warriors**. Use a natural way in your language to offer a summary that concludes a section. Alternate translation: [Those are some of the things that David’s three mighty warriors did for him] or [So ends the account of what these three warriors did]

(Joab was also the son of Zeruiah, but the author is making clear that Zeruiah was the mother of Abishai. She could have been the mother of Joab without being the mother of Abishai.) Abishai was Joab’s younger brother. Your language may have its own terms or expressions for these relationships. Alternate translation: [And Abishai, who was the brother of Joab and the son of Zeruiah]
23:18	pag9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	צְרוּיָ֗ה	1	The word **Zeruiah** is the name of a woman, David’s older sister. See how you translated her name in [2:13](../02/13.md).
23:18	ryi2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הַשְּׁלֹשָׁ֔ה & בַּ⁠שְּׁלֹשָֽׁה	1	The author seems to be describing two different groups of three warriors. The ULT distinguishes between them by treating the word **Three** as a title (uppercase) when it describes the great warriors of the first rank, Josheb Basshebeth, Eleazar, and Shammah ([23:8–12](../23/08.md)), and by treating the word **three** as a description (lowercase) when it describes the great warriors of the second rank, Abishai, Benaiah, and another unnamed warrior ([23:13–23](../23/13.md)). Your language may have a convention of its own that you could use to distinguish between these groups, or you could use descriptive phrases, as the UST does. Some versions express the interpretation that Abishai was the commander of the Three, that is, the great warriors of the first rank. Other versions follow some ancient manuscripts and say that Abishai was the commander of the Thirty, the warriors listed in [23:24–39](../23/24.md). If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
23:18	a14y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ה֚וּא רֹ֣אשׁ	1	The author is using the image of the **head** to represent a leader or commander. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [he was the commander]

23:18	nx7z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠ל⁠וֹ־שֵׁ֖ם בַּ⁠שְּׁלֹשָֽׁה	1	Here, **name** represents reputation or honor.

23:19	acnd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מִן־הַ⁠שְּׁלֹשָׁה֙ הֲ⁠כִ֣י נִכְבָּ֔ד	1	The author is using the question form for emphasis to affirm that Abishai was indeed the most honored of the three. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [He was certainly the most honored of the three.]
23:19	wbah		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	מִן־הַ⁠שְּׁלֹשָׁה֙ הֲ⁠כִ֣י נִכְבָּ֔ד	1	The expression **he was the most honored** is a passive verbal form.

Alternate translation: [People certainly honored him the most of the three]
23:19	h8b4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠עַד־הַ⁠שְּׁלֹשָׁ֖ה לֹא־בָֽא	1	Here, **come to** represents joining or achieving the same level of status as the Three. The verse means that although Abishai was a great warrior and was highly honored, he did not achieve membership in or equal status with the Three. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly, here and in [verse 23](../23/23.md). Alternate translation: [But he did not join the ranks of the Three] or [But he did achieve the same exploits and reputation as the Three]
23:20	zmzk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בֶּן־אִֽישׁ־חַ֛יִל	1	In certain contexts, biblical authors and characters use the expression **son of** to indicate that a person has the characteristic of something. In this case, the author is saying that Benaiah has the characteristic of **valor**. See how you translated the similar expression in [12:5](../12/05.md). Alternate translation: [was characterized by being a man of valor]
23:20	tttr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	רַב־פְּעָלִ֖ים	1	The author is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

23:20	n1o3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ה֣וּא הִכָּ֗ה & וְ֠⁠הוּא יָרַ֞ד	1	The author is stating the pronoun **he** separately in each of these instances, even though the verbs translated as **he struck** and **he went down** already include this meaning. He is doing that to confirm Benaiah’s exclusive personal role in accomplishing these feats. If a speaker of your language would use an explicit pronoun for this same purpose, you may want to use that construction in your translation. If not, your language may have other ways of showing that the author is confirming Benaiah’s exclusive personal role. It may not be necessary to represent the separately stated pronoun explicitly. Alternate translation: [He single-handedly struck … And he went down alone]
23:20	yyty		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	אֵ֣ת שְׁנֵ֤י אֲרִאֵל֙ מוֹאָ֔ב	1	Interpreters do not understand exactly what the term **Ariel** means. However, many interpreters believe that it may be describing warrior champions as lion-like, that is, strong and fierce. Alternate translation: [two mighty champions of Moab] or [two fierce warrior heroes of Moab]
23:20	lwqj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	אֲרִאֵל֙	1	While the term **Ariel** is singular in the original, since the author is referring to **two** such people, it may be more natural in your language to use a plural form. Alternate translation: [Ariels]

Alternate translation: [And Benaiah, the son of Jehoiada, from Kabzeel, was a son of a man of valor, many deeds]
23:21	vxc5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אִ֣ישׁ מַרְאֶ֗ה	1	The author is using **a man of appearance** as a common expression of his culture to mean a giant. If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [a man who was a terror to behold] or [a giant]
23:21	b2li		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֵּ֥רֶד אֵלָ֖י⁠ו	1	The author seems to mean that Benaiah **went down** from the Israelite battle lines on a safe height, and he went into a valley to fight this **man of Egypt** in single combat between the battle lines. Alternate translation: [and he went into a valley to fight him in single combat]
23:23	vhnx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	מִן־הַ⁠שְּׁלֹשִׁ֣ים נִכְבָּ֔ד	1	The expression **he was honored** is a passive verbal form.

23:32	stcl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	בְּנֵ֥י יָשֵׁ֖ן יְהוֹנָתָֽן	1	It is possible that here the author is using the plural term **sons** to introduce a single individual, as in [Genesis 46:23](../../gen/46/23.md), “And the sons of Dan, Hushim.” Alternate translation: [Jonathan the son of Jashen]
23:33	r836		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	שַׁמָּה֙ הַֽ⁠הֲרָרִ֔י	1	Since the author lists **Shammah the Hararite** as one of the Three greatest warriors in [23:11–12](../23/11.md), his name seems out of place in this list of the Thirty. Some interpreters suggest that the explanation is that the Jonathan mentioned in the previous verse was his son. Some versions accordingly read, at the end of the previous verse and the beginning of this one, “Jonathan the son of Shammah the Hararite.” The reading in [1 Chronicles 11:34](../../1ch/11/34.md) suggests this as a possible reading. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
23:39	nmvo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	שְׁלֹשִׁ֥ים וְ⁠שִׁבְעָֽה	1	The total of **37** warriors seems to be the sum of the thirty-one listed in [23:24–39](../23/24.md), described as the Thirty, and those said to be greater than these Thirty, that is, the Three described in [23:11–12](../23/11.md) and the three described in ([23:13–23](../23/13.md) (although one of them is not named). To help your readers see how this total reflects the names the author provides, you may wish to translate “Thirty” in [23:24](../23/24.md) as a title, as the ULT does, rather than as a number (“30”).
24:intro	abco				0	# 2 Samuel 24 Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter concludes the supplemental information about David’s reign as king of Israel that the author provides at the end of the book. It presents the sixth and last part of that information, a description of how David counted the men in his kingdom who were able to serve as soldiers, how Yahweh punished Israel with a plague as a result, and how Yahweh mercifully ended the plague.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### “into the hand of man, do not let me fall”\n\nYahweh sends the prophet Gad to David to tell him that he must choose among three punishments for counting the fighting men of Israel. There could be famine in Israel for seven years, the Israelites could be defeated by their enemies for three months, or there could be a plague for three days. David chooses the plague, saying, “Please, let us fall into the hand of Yahweh, for his mercies are many, but into the hand of man, do not let me fall.” Gad understands from this that David is choosing the plague, and he returns that answer to Yahweh, since the plague is what happens. It is clear that having a plague would be to come under the power of Yahweh and that being defeated by enemies would be to come under the power of man. But how would a famine similarly constitute coming under the power of man? The explanation seems to be that if there were famine in Israel, the Israelites would be dependent on foreign nations for food, and those nations might take advantage of their helplessness to oppress them. Some Israelites might move to other countries in search of food, and they would be vulnerable there as foreigners. If it would be helpful to your readers, you might explain this in a footnote.

Alternate translation: [And Yahweh became angry with Israel again] or [And Yahweh continued to be angry with Israel]

This could mean: (1) that the author is summarizing here what he quotes David more fully as saying in the next verse. Alternate translation: [so that David said, “Go, count Israel and Judah]; (2) that the author is depicting Yahweh as having said something in order to convey the idea that Yahweh led that person to do that thing. This would be similar to [16:10](../16/10.md), where David says of Shimei, “If he curses because Yahweh has said to him, ‘Curse David,’” meaning, “If he curses because Yahweh has led him to curse me.” Alternate translation: [leading him to go and count Israel and Judah]
24:2	mxhj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הַ⁠חַ֣יִל אֲשֶׁר־אִתּ֗⁠וֹ	1	This seems to be a reference to the corps of soldiers stationed at the court who always remained on active military duty, that is, to David’s permanent army. The author describes these troops in [15:18](../15/18.md) and [20:7](../20/07.md), and he says in [8:16](../08/16.md) that Joab commanded them. David wanted to know how many further men were eligible for military service, that is, how great were his reserves. Alternate translation: [his standing army]

24:2	fhjf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֶת־הָ⁠עָ֑ם	1	By **the people**, in this context David means the men who could serve in his army. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [the fighting men]

24:5	ha8d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	הַ⁠גָּ֖ד וְ⁠אֶל־יַעְזֵֽר	1	The author is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

24:9	i5tz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	אִֽישׁ־חַ֨יִל֙	1	The phrase **men of valor** refers to men who had the qualities of strength and courage. If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **valor**, you could express this idea with words that describe men who are brave and strong in battle. Alternate translation: [valiant men] or [strong men]
24:9	s9ng		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	שֹׁ֣לֵֽף חֶ֔רֶב	1	The author is using this phrase, **drawing the sword**, to mean soldiers, by association with the way that soldiers at this time drew swords in order to fight battles. Alternate translation: [who could serve as soldiers]

Yahweh is speaking (level 1) and quoting what he wants Gad to say (level 2), which is that he, Yahweh, has a message for David. Yahweh then presents this message to David as a direct quotation (level 3). Use the appropriate punctuation in your language to mark these levels of quotation. Alternatively, you could translate this so that there are not second-level and third-level quotations (see the Quotes within Quotes note).
24:12	caiy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	הָל֞וֹךְ וְ⁠דִבַּרְתָּ֣ אֶל־דָּוִ֗ד כֹּ֚ה אָמַ֣ר יְהוָ֔ה שָׁלֹ֕שׁ אָנֹכִ֖י נוֹטֵ֣ל עָלֶ֑י⁠ךָ בְּחַר־לְ⁠ךָ֥ אַֽחַת־מֵ⁠הֶ֖ם וְ⁠אֶֽעֱשֶׂה־לָּֽ⁠ךְ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation.

24:12	wqn6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	שָׁלֹ֕שׁ	1	Yahweh is using the adjective **Three** as a noun to mean three things or options. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this adjective with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: [Three things]
24:12	fx22		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אָנֹכִ֖י נוֹטֵ֣ל עָלֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1	Yahweh is speaking of the three choices of punishment as if they were objects he could **lift** and hold over David. This is a metaphor that indicates that Yahweh is presenting these choices to David and has authority over how they will be carried out. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [I am laying out for you] or [I am presenting for you to consider]
24:13	oyic		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יַּגֶּד־ל֑⁠וֹ	1	The implication is that Gad declared to David the three choices that Yahweh had given him, as stated in the previous verse.

24:13	ying		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	לִ⁠פְנֵֽי־צָרֶ֜י⁠ךָ וְ⁠ה֣וּא רֹדְפֶ֗⁠ךָ	1	Since the word **enemies** is plural, it may be more natural in your language to refer back to it with a plural pronoun. Alternate translation: [in front of your enemies while they pursue you]
24:13	z3en		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	דַּ֣ע וּ⁠רְאֵ֔ה	1	Gad is using **know and see** as a common expression of his culture to mean “consider thoughtfully.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [consider thoughtfully]
24:13	tk04		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מָה־אָשִׁ֥יב & דָּבָֽר	1	Gad is speaking of a message or reply as if it were a **word** that was an object he could carry back to Yahweh.

Alternate translation: [since the mercies of Yahweh are many, let us fall into his hand]
24:14	bzwe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	נִפְּלָה & בְ⁠יַד־יְהוָה֙	1	Here, **hand** represents the capability of a person. In this case, it refers to Yahweh’s power to punish and his ability to show mercy. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [let Yahweh be the one to punish us]
24:14	ohd0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אַל־אֶפֹּֽלָה	1	In this verse David uses the first-person singular pronoun **me** when asking God not to let him fall into human hands, even though he had just used “us” when speaking about falling into God’s hands. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use plural pronouns consistently, since David is speaking on behalf of all Israel. Alternate translation: [do not let us fall]
24:15	of9q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	עֵ֣ת מוֹעֵ֑ד	1	The author is using the possessive form to describe a **time** that is characterized by its having been appointed. If a speaker of your language would not use the possessive form for this, you could express this idea in another way. Alternate translation: [the appointed time]
24:15	o9e4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	אִֽישׁ	1	Here the masculine term **men** has a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use language in your translation that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: [people]
24:16	l81x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּשְׁלַח֩ יָד֨⁠וֹ הַ⁠מַּלְאָ֥ךְ	1	The author could be using the same expression that occurs earlier in the book, in [1:14](../01/14.md) and [18:12](../18/12.md), to mean that the angel was preparing to use violence (in the form of this plague) against the people of the city of Jerusalem. When Yahweh tells him to **lower** his **hand**, that could mean that he is not to afflict the people with the plague. However, since David sees the angel, it seems more likely that the angel actually had reached out and upward with his hand and that Yahweh told him to put his hand back down and not use it to cause the plague. So you may choose to translate this literally.
24:16	q6sr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	הַ⁠מַּלְאָ֥ךְ	1	The term **the angel** refers to the angel whom God sent to bring a plague on Israel. You could identify this **angel** more fully in that way here. However, this angel is identified in [verse 17](../24/17.md) as “the striker among the people.” Because this information appears in the following verse, you may not find a need to explain about the angel further here.
24:17	s0rq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הִנֵּ֨ה	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [1:2](../01/02.md). Alternate translation: [Listen]

He is doing that acknowledge his personal responsibility for sinning by taking a census of the Israelite soldiers. If a speaker of your language would use an explicit pronoun for this same purpose, you may want to use that construction in your translation. If not, your language may have other ways of showing that the David is acknowledging his personal responsibility. It may not be necessary to represent the separately stated pronoun explicitly. Alternate translation: [I was the one who sinned, yes, I was the one who committed iniquity]
