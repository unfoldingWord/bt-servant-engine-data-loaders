The Israelites renew the covenant at Shechem ([23:1–24:28](../23/01.md))\n3. The death of Joshua ([24:29–33](../24/29.md))\n\n### What is the book of Joshua about?\n\nThe book of Joshua is about the Israelites entering and occupying the land of Canaan. Joshua was the leader who replaced Moses. He led the Israelites as they fought against the people groups that had been living in Canaan. This book then tells how the Israelites divided the land among the 12 tribes. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]])\n\n### Who wrote the book of Joshua?\n\nThe book does not tell us who wrote it. However, some verses in the book indicate that Joshua may have written at least part of it. Since ancient times the Jewish people have thought that Joshua recorded much of what is in this book.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nThis book has traditionally had the title “Joshua” because it tells how Joshua led the people of Israel. Translators may create a title such as “The Book About When Joshua Led Israel.” Translators should avoid a title that suggests that Joshua was the writer of the book, as it is not certain how much of it he may have written.\n\n### When should Joshua be translated?\n\nThe book of Joshua should probably be translated after Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. This is because the historical events described in the book of Joshua may be more difficult to understand without the information in those previous books.\n\n## Part 2: Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Book\n\n### “devoted”\n\nThe word that the ULT translates as “devoted” was a specialized term that described the cultural practice of giving something over to Yahweh so that humans would no longer be able to use it. Depending on the context, the term can indicate either “destroyed” or “preserved, but set apart.” The context must determine the meaning, so be sensitive to the context as you translate this term.\n\n## Part 3: Translation Issues in This Book\n\n### “struck,” “struck to the mouth of the sword,” “to the mouth of the sword”\n\nThe author often uses the expression “to the mouth of the sword” in connection with the term “devoted.” It was a common expression of his culture that referred to destroying something completely. When it appears, as it does about a dozen times in the book, it helps clarify what the term “devoted” means in a specific context. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])\n\nIn many places, the author says that soldiers “struck” an opposing army, city, king, or kings, as if they had only hit them. But he means that they attacked those opponents, and in some contexts the meaning is clearly that they killed them. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])\n\nIn several contexts the author uses a longer form of this expression and says Joshua and his soldiers “struck them (or it) to the mouth of the sword.” This means that they completely destroyed a city, killing everyone who lived there. For example, speaking in [11:11](../11/11.md) of what Joshua and his army did to the inhabitants of the city of Hazor, the author says that “they struck every soul that was in it (the city of Hazor) to the mouth of the sword.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])\n\n### “And it happened”\n\nThe author often uses the phrase “And it happened” to introduce a new event in the story or a new development within an episode. To translate this phrase in its various occurrences, use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event or development. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent]])\n\n### “to this day”\n\nThe author used this phrase to refer to the time when he was writing. The translator should be aware that “to this day” refers to a time that is now in the past. He must avoid giving the impression to his readers that “to this day” means “to the present day.” The translator might decide to use an equivalent phrase such as “at the time of this writing.”\n\n### “And now”\n\nCharacters in the story who are making a speech or delivering a message often use the phrase “And now” to introduce their main point. That point typically relates to what they want their listeners to do in response to what they have said so far. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. For example, you might say something such as “Now here is my main point” or “Now here is what I want you to do.”\n\n### “hear” and “listen”\n\nThe author and characters sometimes use the words “hear” and “listen” in a specialized sense to mean someone complying with what they have heard or listened to someone saying. When these words refer to a person, they have the sense of “obey.” When they apply to God, they indicate that God did what someone asked him to do, so you might say that God “answered” that person’s prayer. At other times, these words have a more literal sense of sound registering in the ears, that is, of a person taking in and understanding information. Be sensitive to the meaning of these words in the context as you translate them.\n\n### The name of tribe or nation representing its people or army\n\nThe author and characters often use the name of a nation or Israelite tribe to mean its people or its army. It may sound as if an individual with that name is doing an action, but it is actually a group of people descended from that individual. Once you are aware of this usage, the meaning should be evident from the context. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])\n\n### “the sons of”\n\nSimilarly, the author and characters often use the expression “the sons of” to mean the people or army of a nation or Israelite tribe descended from the individual who is then named. They do not mean only the literal, first-generation male descendants of that person. Once you are aware of this usage, the meaning should be evident from the context. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### “to the face of”\n\nThe author and characters often use the expression “to the face of” to mean “before,” “in front of,” or “in the presence of” a person or thing. This is by association with the way one can see the face of a person who is present and the way people typically face forward, toward what is before or in front of them. This usage occurs very frequently in the book, about 60 times, and accounts for almost every instance of the word “face.” Only in [5:14](../05/14.md) and [7:6](../07/06.md) does the word refer literally to part of the body, where Joshua bows down with his face to the ground. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])\n\n### “all of Israel”\n\nThis phrase appears 16 times in the book of Joshua, but it does not always mean every single person in the nation of Israel. Often it means the Israelite army. At other times it refers to representatives of the 12 tribes of Israel. In still other passages, it probably means a large number of the people in the nation of Israel. However, in a few contexts it does seem to indicate every Israelite, as when Yahweh tells Joshua in [3:7](../03/07.md), “This day I will begin to make you great in the eyes of all of Israel, who will know that just as I was with Moses, I am with you.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])\n\n### “shall” \n\nThe ULT represents the Hebrew instructional verb form with the English helping verb “shall.” For example, when Yahweh tells Joshua in [1:15](../01/15.md) “Then you shall return to the land” he is instructing Joshua about what to do next. Another way to say this would be, “Then you are to return to the land.” Translate this form with the most natural way in your language for giving instructions. \n\n## Part 4: Specific Translation Issues in Chapters 13–21\n\nThere are some specific translation issues in the section of the book that describes the territories of the Israelite tribes and their borders.\n\n### “inheritance”\n\nThe author uses the idea of “inheritance” by association to mean a lasting possession that would be passed down to future generations. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])\n\n### “went up,” “went down”\n\nIn Hebrew, writers and speakers generally indicated whether people were going up to a higher elevation or going down to a lower elevation when they traveled. Such expressions occur frequently in the descriptions of tribal borders. If your language does not mark travel for change in elevation, you can translate such expressions more simply. For example, you could just say “went” instead of “went up” or “went down.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo]])\n\n### “from” a direction “to” a place\n\nThe author describes the location of one place relative to another in the way that is characteristic of his culture. For example, speaking of the territory of Naphtali, he describes the territory of Asher as being “from the west” relative to it, meaning that someone would be coming from the west to go from Asher to Naphtali. In your translation, express this in the way that your culture describes the relative location of places. For example, you might say instead that Asher was “to the west” of Naphtali. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])\n\n### “the sea”\n\nWhen the author says “the sea,” he means the Mediterranean Sea. He calls it the Great Sea when he gives it a name. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])\n\n### “seaward”\n\nThe author uses the term **seaward** by association to mean toward the direction of the Mediterranean Sea, that is, from his perspective, to the west. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])\n\n### “toward the sunrise,” “from the sunrise”\n\nThe author uses the term **sunrise** by association to mean the direction where the sun rises, that is, the east. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])\n\n### Names in border descriptions\n\nAll names in border descriptions are the names of cities and towns unless otherwise indicated in the biblical text, in a note, or in the UST. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])
1:intro	r7gc				0	# Joshua 1 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter describes the Israelites’ preparations for the conquest of the land of Canaan.\n  * Yahweh encourages Joshua ([1:1–9](../01/01.md))\n  * The eastern tribes send their armies ([1:10–16](../01/10.md))\n\nAt the start of the book of Joshua, the biblical narrative continues naturally from the end of the book of Deuteronomy.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### “be strong and courageous”\n\nYahweh tells Joshua in [verses 6](../01/06.md), [7](../01/07.md), and [9](../01/09.md) to “be strong and courageous,” and the leaders of the eastern tribes tell him the same thing in [verse 18](../01/18.md). The words “strong” and “courageous” mean similar things. Yahweh and the tribal leaders are using the two terms together for emphasis. Joshua needs to act with great courage, and if he does, Yahweh will give him victory and honor him. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single word or phrase, but you should translate this expression the same way each time so that your readers will recognize its importance in this part of the story. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet]])\n\n### “you” and “your”\n\nThe words “you” and “your” are plural in vv. 2–3 because Yahweh is speaking about the Israelites. They are singular in vv. 2–9 because Yahweh is speaking to Joshua. They are plural in vv. 11–15 because groups are being addressed. They are singular in vv. 16–18 because the tribal leaders are speaking to Joshua.
1:1	s8u5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֗י	1	As the Introduction to Joshua discusses, the author is using this phrase, **Now it happened**, to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event.
1:1	eka2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	נ֔וּן	1	The word **Nun** is the name of a man, Joshua’s father.
1:2	le23		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וְ⁠עַתָּה֩	1	As the Introduction to Joshua discusses, the phrase translated as **And now** is an expression that people of this time used to introduce the main point of a message. If your language has a comparable expression that it uses for this same purpose, you can use it in your translation, here and for the other instances of this expression in the book. Alternate translation: [So here is what I want you to do:]
1:2	xugz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ק֨וּם	1	Yahweh is using the expression **arise** to tell Joshua to take action and lead the Israelites across the Jordan River to begin the conquest of Canaan. He is not telling him to get out of bed or stand up from a seated position. Alternate translation: [get going]
1:2	ragw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	לָ⁠הֶ֖ם לִ⁠בְנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	Since Joshua is one of the **sons of Israel**, Yahweh is referring to him in the third person when he says **them**. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could have Yahweh refer to him in the second person. This would indicate explicitly that Joshua is included in this promise. Alternate translation: [to you and the rest of the sons of Israel] or [to you and all of the other people of Israel]
1:2	o0hj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לִ⁠בְנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	As the Introduction to Joshua discusses, here and in many places throughout the book, **sons** means “descendants,” so the phrase **sons of** is describing a people group. Alternate translation: [to the people of Israel]
1:3	t94e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	כָּל־מָק֗וֹם אֲשֶׁ֨ר תִּדְרֹ֧ךְ כַּֽף־רַגְלְ⁠כֶ֛ם בּ֖⁠וֹ	1	Yahweh is using part of each of the Israelites, **the sole of your foot**, to represent the people of Israel themselves. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [Every place upon which you will tread]
1:3	xjc9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	רַגְלְ⁠כֶ֛ם & לָ⁠כֶ֣ם	1	Here, the words **your** and **you** are plural and refer to Joshua and all the other Israelite people. It may be more natural in your language to use a plural form of **foot** and to indicate specifically that **you** is plural. Alternate translation: [your feet … to all of you]
1:3	v1l7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	לָ⁠כֶ֣ם נְתַתִּ֑י⁠ו	1	Yahweh is using the past tense in order to refer to something that he will do in the future. He is doing this to show that the event will certainly happen. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use the future tense. Alternate translation: [I will give it to you] or [I will certainly give it to you]
1:4	xqnb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	הַ⁠נָּהָ֧ר הַ⁠גָּד֣וֹל נְהַר־פְּרָ֗ת	1	The phrase **the Great River** is another name used for **the Euphrates River**. Alternate translation: [the Great River, that is, the Euphrates River]
1:4	nffx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	הַ⁠יָּ֥ם הַ⁠גָּד֖וֹל	1	The phrase **the Great Sea** is another name for the “Mediterranean Sea.”
1:4	pust		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מְב֣וֹא הַ⁠שָּׁ֑מֶשׁ	1	Yahweh is using **the going of the sun**, that is, the sunset, by association to mean “the west,” since the sun sets in the west. Alternate translation: [in the west]
1:4	nbe3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	גְּבוּלְ⁠כֶֽם	1	Here, the word **your** is plural and refers to the tribes of Israel and includes Joshua. Alternate translation: [the territory of you Israelites]
1:5	l58e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לֹֽא & אִישׁ֙	1	Since the book of Joshua describes how the kings of cities and kingdoms led their soldiers into battle to oppose Joshua, the phrase **No man** seems implicitly to mean “No king and his army” or more broadly “No people group.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: [No king and his army] or [No people group]
1:5	rk2g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יִתְיַצֵּ֥ב & לְ⁠פָנֶ֔י⁠ךָ	1	In this context, the word **stand** means “resist” or “withstand.” You could indicate this meaning explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [will be able to resist to your face] or [will be able to resist you]
1:5	wkfh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	יִתְיַצֵּ֥ב & לְ⁠פָנֶ֔י⁠ךָ	1	In this context the phrase **to your face** either means “in front of you,” with **face** meaning by association the area in front of Joshua, or “against you,” with part of Joshua, his **face**, representing all of him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [will be able to stand against you] or [will be able to resist you]
1:5	w48w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	לְ⁠פָנֶ֔י⁠ךָ & חַיֶּ֑י⁠ךָ & עִמָּ֔⁠ךְ & אַרְפְּ⁠ךָ֖ & אֶעֶזְבֶֽ⁠ךָּ	1	As the introduction to this chapter discusses, the words **you** and **your** are singular in this verse and through [verse 9](../01/09.md), since they refer to Joshua. So, use singular forms in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
1:5	iq2e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	לֹ֥א אַרְפְּ⁠ךָ֖ וְ⁠לֹ֥א אֶעֶזְבֶֽ⁠ךָּ	1	The phrases **I will not abandon you** and **I will not leave you** mean the same thing. Yahweh says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to emphasize to Joshua that he will be with him. If saying the same thing twice might be confusing for your readers, you could combine the phrases into one. Alternate translation: [I will not ever abandon you] or [I will certainly stay with you always]
1:5	r3k2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	לֹ֥א אַרְפְּ⁠ךָ֖ וְ⁠לֹ֥א אֶעֶזְבֶֽ⁠ךָּ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate these two double negatives that consist of the negative particle **not** and the negative verb **abandon** and **leave**. Alternate translation: [I will always be with you and help you]
1:6	a5yc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	חֲזַ֖ק וֶ⁠אֱמָ֑ץ	1	The phrases **Be strong** and **be courageous** mean similar things. Yahweh is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: [Be very courageous]
1:6	gn34		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לַ⁠אֲבוֹתָ֖⁠ם	1	Here, **fathers** means “ancestors” and refers specifically to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [to their forefathers] or [to their forefathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob]
1:7	xle4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	חֲזַ֨ק וֶֽ⁠אֱמַ֜ץ מְאֹ֗ד	1	These are the same two phrases that occurred in the previous verse, except the word **very** is added here for increased emphasis. See how you translated the phrase “Be strong and be courageous” in the previous verse and consider how you might add even more emphasis here. Alternate translation: [Be entirely courageous]
1:7	fi6s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אַל־תָּס֥וּר מִמֶּ֖⁠נּוּ יָמִ֣ין וּ⁠שְׂמֹ֑אול	1	Yahweh is speaking as if **the law that Moses … commanded** were literally a road that Joshua was walking on and as if Joshua might **turn aside from** it and walk on a different path. He means that Joshua must not stop living in the manner in which God commanded in the law. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [Do not stop obeying it]
1:7	db9m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	יָמִ֣ין וּ⁠שְׂמֹ֑אול	1	Yahweh is speaking of two things in order to mean those things and everything in between them. Continuing the image of the road, he means that Joshua should not go off the road in any direction. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [in any way]
1:8	g4qg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לֹֽא־יָמ֡וּשׁ סֵפֶר֩ הַ⁠תּוֹרָ֨ה הַ⁠זֶּ֜ה מִ⁠פִּ֗י⁠ךָ	1	Yahweh is using the phrase **shall not depart from your mouth** by association to mean that Joshua must continually read the **Book of the Law**, since people at this time read aloud, even when reading alone, so Joshua would use his mouth to form the words as he read. (However, this is not a command to read only alone. It envisions that Joshua might at times read the law aloud to the people of Israel.) Alternate translation: [You shall not stop reading the Book of the Law]
1:8	vu2t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	יוֹמָ֣ם וָ⁠לַ֔יְלָה	1	Yahweh is referring to the two main components of time, **day** and **night**, to mean “all the time.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [continually]
1:8	lcs7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	תַּצְלִ֥יחַ אֶת־דְּרָכֶ֖⁠ךָ וְ⁠אָ֥ז תַּשְׂכִּֽיל	1	The phrases **you will make your ways prosperous** and **you will succeed** mean similar things. Yahweh is using the two phrases together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: [you will assuredly be successful]
1:8	k618		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	תַּצְלִ֥יחַ אֶת־דְּרָכֶ֖⁠ךָ	1	Yahweh is speaking of Joshua’s **ways** as if they were a living thing that Joshua could **make … prosperous**. Yahweh is speaking of Joshua’s actions as if they were **ways** or roads that he was walking on. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [you will prosper in what you do]
1:9	vt4l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠ל֤וֹא צִוִּיתִ֨י⁠ךָ֙	1	Yahweh is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [Surely I have commanded you!]
1:9	fnz8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	חֲזַ֣ק וֶ⁠אֱמָ֔ץ	1	See how you translated these same phrases in [Joshua 1:6](../01/06.md). Alternate translation: [Be very courageous]
1:9	vwe1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	אַֽל־תַּעֲרֹ֖ץ וְ⁠אַל־תֵּחָ֑ת כִּ֤י עִמְּ⁠ךָ֙ יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔י⁠ךָ בְּ⁠כֹ֖ל אֲשֶׁ֥ר תֵּלֵֽךְ	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: [Since Yahweh your God is with you in every place where you go, do not be terrified and do not be dismayed]
1:9	u820		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	אַֽל־תַּעֲרֹ֖ץ וְ⁠אַל־תֵּחָ֑ת	1	The phrases **Do not be terrified** and **do not be dismayed** mean similar things. Yahweh combines them to emphasize that Joshua must not fear. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: [Make sure that you are not terrified] or [There is absolutely no reason for you to be terrified]
1:9	f8qm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	עִמְּ⁠ךָ֙ יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֔י⁠ךָ	1	Here Yahweh speaks about himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this with the first person. Alternate translation: [I, Yahweh your God, am with you]
1:11	f3rg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	וְ⁠צַוּ֤וּ אֶת־הָ⁠עָם֙ לֵ⁠אמֹ֔ר הָכִ֥ינוּ לָ⁠כֶ֖ם צֵידָ֑ה כִּ֞י בְּ⁠ע֣וֹד ׀ שְׁלֹ֣שֶׁת יָמִ֗ים אַתֶּם֙ עֹֽבְרִים֙ אֶת־הַ⁠יַּרְדֵּ֣ן הַ⁠זֶּ֔ה לָ⁠בוֹא֙ לָ⁠רֶ֣שֶׁת אֶת־הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ אֲשֶׁר֙ יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹֽהֵי⁠כֶ֔ם נֹתֵ֥ן לָ⁠כֶ֖ם לְ⁠רִשְׁתָּֽ⁠הּ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: [and command the people to prepare provisions for themselves, because within three days they will be crossing over this Jordan to enter to possess the land that Yahweh their God is giving to them to possess it]
1:11	ck8h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בְּ⁠ע֣וֹד ׀ שְׁלֹ֣שֶׁת יָמִ֗ים	1	Joshua was counting the current day as day one. This was the way that Jewish people counted days. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: [in two days from now] or [on the day after tomorrow]
1:13	dgxd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	זָכוֹר֙ אֶת־הַ⁠דָּבָ֔ר אֲשֶׁ֨ר	1	Joshua did not think that the people from these three tribes had forgotten what Moses had instructed them. Rather, he is using the word **Remember** to cause them to pay attention to what he is going to say next. If you would not use the word **Remember** for this purpose, you could use an equivalent expression or indicate the meaning explicitly. Alternate translation: [You know the word that] or [You recall the word that] or [Keep in mind the word that]

2:intro	vg4m				0	# Joshua 2 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter begins the story of the conquest of the land of Canaan by describing how Joshua sends spies to investigate the situation in the city of Jericho.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Rahab’s faith\n\nEven though Rahab was a Canaanite, she expressed her faith in Yahweh, the God of Israel. The statement “for Yahweh your God, he is God in heaven above and on the earth below” is an expression of her faith. Because Rahab recognized Yahweh as the true God, she helped the Israelites, and as a result, they spared her and her family. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]])

Alternate translation: [and you will not let your fellow Israelites kill us]

This actually occurred after Rahab spoke her final words to the spies in [Joshua 2:21](../02/21.md). In your translation, you may wish to relate these events in the order in which they happened and put the information in this verse after the quotation from Rahab in [Joshua 2:21](../02/21.md). Alternatively, you could indicate that what the author says here anticipates what happens a little later in the story. Alternate translation: [Then she agreed to lower them down by a rope through the window]

Because Rahab’s house was built into the city wall, she was able to let the spies out a window and lower them down to the ground outside the city wall. That way they were able to escape from the city even though the gates had been shut. In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.

But suppose someone stays with you in the house. Then his blood will be on our heads if a hand is laid on him]

2:19	giu3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	בְ⁠רֹאשֵׁ֔⁠נוּ	1	Since the spies are referring to themselves, and there are two of them, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **head**. Alternate translation: [on our heads]
2:19	qg47		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	יָ֖ד תִּֽהְיֶה־בּֽ⁠וֹ	1	The spies are using the expression **a hand shall be upon** to mean that someone would be injured or harmed.

(The author is making a play on words; in the previous verse, the pursuers did not “find” the spies; instead, exciting and encouraging things **found** them as they explored the land.) If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [all that they had seen and experienced]
2:24	avki		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	נָתַ֧ן יְהוָ֛ה בְּ⁠יָדֵ֖⁠נוּ אֶת־כָּל־הָ⁠אָ֑רֶץ	1	The two spies are using the past tense in order to refer to something that will happen in the future.

The people needed to be in a state of special dedication to Yahweh in order to appreciate what he was doing and take part in it. The conquest of the Promised Land was to be accomplished through the supernatural power of God. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/miracle]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/promisedland]])

4:intro	eh7p				0	# Joshua 4 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter finishes the story of how the Israelites crossed the Jordan River, even though it was at flood stage and overflowing its banks, because Yahweh stopped its waters from flowing.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Victory through the power of Yahweh\n\nThe conquest of the land of Canaan was accomplished by Yahweh’s power, which he showed to be greater than that of all the kings in the land of Canaan. Joshua recognized that the Israelites would only be victorious through Yahweh’s power. This is why his first act after crossing the Jordan River was to have them build a monument of stones from the river as a witness to Yahweh’s power.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Chiasm\n\nHebrew poetry sometimes uses a literary device called a “chiasm.” A chiasm is when words or phrases are ordered in a AB-BA sequence. This helps make a saying more memorable. Joshua uses a chiasm in [4:7](../04/07.md) when he tells the Israelites what to say to their children when they ask about the monument of stones:\n\nA Because the waters of the Jordan were cut off\nB from the face of the Box of the Covenant of Yahweh.\nB In its crossing over in the Jordan,\nA the waters of the Jordan were cut off.\n\nYou may be able to present this in your translation in a way that shows this literary device.

5:intro	dv8f				0	# Joshua 5 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter begins with a notice of how the kings in the land of Canaan feared Yahweh when they heard how he had dried up the Jordan River so the Israelites could cross ([5:1](../05/01.md)).\n\nThe chapter then describes how the Israelites were careful to observe the law of Moses as soon as they entered the land of Canaan.\n  * The Israelite men were circumcised ([5:2–9](../05/02.md)\n  * All the Israelites celebrated Passover ([5:10–12](../05/10.md))\n\nThe chapter then describes how the commander of Yahweh’s army came to help Joshua defeat his enemies ([5:13–15](../05/13.md))\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Circumcision\n\nThis was a sign of the covenant that Yahweh had given to the Israelites through Moses. The book of Joshua explains why the Israelite men who crossed the Jordan River had not yet been circumcised. Fulfilling this sign of the covenant was an important expression of how the Israelites would obey the whole law of Moses when they settled in the land of Canaan. It also affirmed the identity of Israel as a nation. Yahweh said that by having the Israelite men circumcised, he had removed “the disgrace of Egypt.” In [Numbers 22:5](../../num/22/05.md), King Balak referred to the Israelites simply as “a people went out from Egypt,” in other words, a horde of runaway Egyptian slaves. Now the Israelites were being clearly constituted as a distinct people group with their own laws and customs as commanded by Yahweh. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/circumcise]])\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### “a man … standing in front of him”\n\nThe author uses the expression “a man” to describe the figure who appears to Joshua in in [5:13](../05/13.md), but in the next verse this figure explains that he is “the prince of the army of Yahweh.” So this is actually not a human being but more likely an angel. The author uses the phrase “a man” because at first that was what Joshua thought he was. Since this figure identifies himself in the next verse, you do not need to say anything such as “an angel who looked like a man” in [5:13](../05/13.md) in your translation.

5:1	z979		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מִ⁠פְּנֵ֥י & מִ⁠פְּנֵ֖י	1	Here, **from the face of** is a common expression of the culture that means “because of” or “on account of.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [on behalf of] or [because of]

5:2	uwpn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	בָּ⁠עֵ֣ת הַ⁠הִ֗יא	1	The author is using this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event.
5:2	nc87		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	חַֽרְב֣וֹת צֻרִ֑ים	1	The word **flint** describes a type of hard stone known for having sharp edges. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of stone, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: [knives of sharpened stone] or [knives with blades made of sharp-edged stone]
5:2	glk7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠שׁ֛וּב מֹ֥ל אֶת־בְּנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל שֵׁנִֽית	1	This does not mean that these men had already been circumcised once and that Yahweh wanted Joshua to circumcise each of them for a **second time**. Rather, as [Joshua 5:4](../05/04.md) explains, the previous generation of male Israelites had been circumcised, but they had died in the wilderness; the current generation of Israelite males had not yet been circumcised. Alternate translation: [and do a second general circumcision of all Israelite males, for this generation]
5:2	d7tg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	שֵׁנִֽית	1	If your language does not use ordinal numbers, you can use a cardinal number here or an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: [for time number two]
5:3	m1u7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יָּ֨מָל֙	1	There were over 600,000 males, so the author is using **Joshua**, who was in charge of this task, to represent the many people who were necessarily involved. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: [And he and other Israelite leaders circumcised]
5:3	jin6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate	גִּבְעַ֖ת הָ⁠עֲרָלֽוֹת	1	**Gibeath Haaraloth** is the name that the Israelites gave to the place where they held this second general circumcision ceremony. The name commemorates the Israelites rededicating themselves to Yahweh. In your translation you could spell it the way it sounds in your language, or you could use a word or phrase from your language that expresses the meaning of this name. Alternate translation: [the Hill of the Foreskins]
5:4	i17c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	הַ⁠יֹּצֵא֩ & בְּ⁠צֵאתָ֖⁠ם	1	In a context such as this, your language may say “having gone” and “in their going out” rather than **having come** and **in their coming out**. Use whichever is more natural, here and in the next two verses.
5:5	u9fk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	כִּֽי־מֻלִ֣ים הָי֔וּ כָּל־הָ⁠עָ֖ם הַ⁠יֹּֽצְאִ֑ים וְ⁠כָל־הָ֠⁠עָם הַ⁠יִּלֹּדִ֨ים	1	There is a contrasting relationship between these two clauses. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a connecting word or phrase on the first clause rather than on the second one. Alternate translation: [While all of the people having come out were circumcised, all the people born]
5:5	b06g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	מֻלִ֣ים הָי֔וּ כָּל־הָ⁠עָ֖ם הַ⁠יֹּֽצְאִ֑ים	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [someone had circumcised all the people who came out]
5:5	mqv5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הָ⁠עָ֖ם & הָ֠⁠עָם	1	In this verse, the expression **the people** means “the males.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: [the males … the males]
5:5	mhgs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	לֹא־מָֽלוּ	1	Here, **they** is an indefinite pronoun that does not have a specific referent in the immediate context. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this with a different expression that does not use an indefinite pronoun. Alternate translation: [had not been circumcised] or [no one had circumcised]
5:6	jre1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	כִּ֣י ׀ אַרְבָּעִ֣ים שָׁנָ֗ה הָלְכ֣וּ בְנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵל֮ בַּ⁠מִּדְבָּר֒ עַד־תֹּ֨ם כָּל־הַ⁠גּ֜וֹי אַנְשֵׁ֤י הַ⁠מִּלְחָמָה֙ הַ⁠יֹּצְאִ֣ים מִ⁠מִּצְרַ֔יִם אֲשֶׁ֥ר לֹֽא־שָׁמְע֖וּ בְּ⁠ק֣וֹל יְהוָ֑ה	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: [Because they had not listened to the voice of Yahweh, the sons of Israel had walked in the wilderness 40 years, until the finishing of all of the nation of the men of war having come out from Egypt]
5:6	qbbd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הַ⁠גּ֜וֹי אַנְשֵׁ֤י הַ⁠מִּלְחָמָה֙	1	The author seems to be speaking as if these **men of war** were a **nation** of their own. In this language and culture, people sometimes used the term “nation” to mean “army,” as in [Joel 1:6](../../jol/01/06.md), for example. Alternate translation: [the men of war in the army]
5:6	u9iz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לֹֽא־שָׁמְע֖וּ בְּ⁠ק֣וֹל יְהוָ֑ה	1	Here, the word **listened** means “obeyed.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: [they had not obeyed the voice of Yahweh]
5:6	k8wl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לֹֽא־שָׁמְע֖וּ בְּ⁠ק֣וֹל יְהוָ֑ה	1	The author is using the **voice** of Yahweh by association to mean the things that Yahweh commanded by using his voice. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [they had not obeyed what Yahweh commanded them] or [they had not done what Yahweh told them to do]
5:6	mu8b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לַֽ⁠אֲבוֹתָ⁠ם֙	1	The author is using the term **fathers** to mean “ancestors.” If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [to their ancestors]
5:6	o55f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	לָ֔⁠נוּ	1	The author is addressing his listeners directly by saying **us**. Since the original listeners were Israelites, **us** would have been inclusive if he had marked that form. However, unless your readers are Israelites, they would not be included in the promises described here, which Yahweh made to Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their descendants. So it might be more natural in your language to use the exclusive form if your language marks that distinction. As a team, decide how to translate this.
5:6	jrp7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֶ֛רֶץ זָבַ֥ת חָלָ֖ב וּ⁠דְבָֽשׁ	1	Yahweh spoke of the land being good for animals and plants as if the **milk** and **honey** from those animals and plants were actually **flowing** through the land. If this metaphor makes sense in your language, you may use it. If your language has metaphors that mean a land is good for producing healthy livestock and good crops, you may consider using those. If neither is the case, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [a fertile land that produces many good things]
5:7	p9pz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	אֹתָ֖⁠ם מָ֣ל יְהוֹשֻׁ֑עַ כִּי־עֲרֵלִ֣ים הָי֔וּ כִּ֛י לֹא־מָ֥לוּ אוֹתָ֖⁠ם בַּ⁠דָּֽרֶךְ	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could rearrange these three phrases so that each phrase gives the reason for the result that the next phrase describes. Alternate translation: [Because they had not circumcised them on the way, they were uncircumcised. So Joshua circumcised them]
5:7	j004		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	עֲרֵלִ֣ים הָי֔וּ כִּ֛י לֹא־מָ֥לוּ אוֹתָ֖⁠ם בַּ⁠דָּֽרֶךְ	1	See how you translated the similar expressions in [Joshua 5:5](../05/05.md). Alternate translation: [no one had circumcised them yet; no one had done this on the way]
5:8	gl0s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	תַּ֥מּוּ כָל־הַ⁠גּ֖וֹי לְ⁠הִמּ֑וֹל	1	The author is using the term **nation** as in [Joshua 5:6](../05/06.md), to refer specifically to the Israelite males. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: [all of the Israelite males had finished being circumcised]
5:8	j005		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	תַּ֥מּוּ כָל־הַ⁠גּ֖וֹי לְ⁠הִמּ֑וֹל	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [the leaders had finished circumcising all of the Israelite males]
5:9	x1q8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	גַּלּ֛וֹתִי אֶת־חֶרְפַּ֥ת מִצְרַ֖יִם מֵ⁠עֲלֵי⁠כֶ֑ם	1	Yahweh is speaking as if he had actually **rolled away** the **disgrace of Egypt** from the Israelites. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [I have removed the disgrace of Egypt from you]
5:9	sgya		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	גַּלּ֛וֹתִי אֶת־חֶרְפַּ֥ת מִצְרַ֖יִם מֵ⁠עֲלֵי⁠כֶ֑ם	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **disgrace**, you could express the same idea in another way. See the discussion of this phrase in the introduction to this chapter. Alternate translation: [I have taken you out of the disgraceful situation you were in as former slaves of the Egyptians]
5:9	j001		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֞א שֵׁ֣ם הַ⁠מָּק֤וֹם הַ⁠הוּא֙ גִּלְגָּ֔ל	1	It might seem that the expression **calls the name** contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in your language. If so, you can shorten it. Alternate translation: [People call that place Gilgal] or [The name of that place has been Gilgal]
5:9	tkpz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	עַ֖ד הַ⁠יּ֥וֹם הַ⁠זֶּֽה	1	See how you translated the phrase **to this day** in [Joshua 4:9](../04/09.md). Alternate translation: [right up to this time]
5:10	tdl1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	בְּ⁠אַרְבָּעָה֩ עָשָׂ֨ר י֥וֹם לַ⁠חֹ֛דֶשׁ	1	It may be more natural in your language to use an ordinal number here. (The expression **the month** refers implicitly to the “first month,” the Hebrew month Aviv, as in [Joshua 4:19](../04/19.md). Alternate translation: [on the fourteenth day of the month of Aviv]
5:13	hegq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּשָּׂ֤א עֵינָי⁠ו֙ וַ⁠יַּ֔רְא	1	The author is using a common expression to mean that Joshua looked some distance away, since he **lifted up his eyes** in order to do this, and he had to walk over to the man whom he saw. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [that he looked off into the distance]
5:13	x26s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠הִנֵּה	1	The author is using the term **behold** to focus the reader’s attention on what Joshua saw standing in front of him. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation.
5:13	ds5l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠חַרְבּ֥⁠וֹ שְׁלוּפָ֖ה בְּ⁠יָד֑⁠וֹ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

In that culture, this action was a way that a person showed great respect and reverence for someone else. If there is a gesture with similar meaning in your culture, you could consider using it here in your translation. You could also explain the significance of the gesture; the UST models one way to do that.
5:14	j018		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	מָ֥ה אֲדֹנִ֖⁠י מְדַבֵּ֥ר אֶל־עַבְדּֽ⁠וֹ	1	As a way of showing respect, Joshua is speaking to the prince of Yahweh’s army and about himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the second and first persons. Alternate translation: [What are you, my lord, speaking to me, your servant]
5:15	qu3d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	שַׁל־נַֽעַלְ⁠ךָ֙ מֵ⁠עַ֣ל רַגְלֶ֔⁠ךָ כִּ֣י הַ⁠מָּק֗וֹם אֲשֶׁ֥ר אַתָּ֛ה עֹמֵ֥ד עָלָ֖י⁠ו קֹ֣דֶשׁ ה֑וּא	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes.

5:15	ge5y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	שַׁל־נַֽעַלְ⁠ךָ֙ מֵ⁠עַ֣ל רַגְלֶ֔⁠ךָ	1	Joshua removing his **sandal** was a symbolic action by which he showed great respect and reverence toward someone superior and acknowledged his willingness to obey him. If there is a gesture with similar meaning in your culture, you could consider using it here in your translation. You could also explain the significance of the gesture; the UST models one way to do that.
5:15	j006		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	נַֽעַלְ⁠ךָ֙	1	The prince of Yahweh’s army is not referring to one particular **sandal** that Joshua was wearing. He means both of Joshua’s sandals.

6:intro	uie9				0	# Joshua 6 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter describes the supernatural way in which Yahweh enabled the Israelites to defeat the people of Jericho and destroy that city.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Yahweh conquers\n\nThe circumstances of Israel’s victory in the battle for Jericho were very unusual. An army would not normally march around a city or shout in order to win a military battle. It was Yahweh who gave the Israelites the victory, as Joshua made clear in [6:16](../06/16.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### “devoted”\n\nThe specialized term that the ULT translates as “devoted” occurs several times in this chapter. See the discussion of that term in the Introduction to Joshua, and see the UST for an expression of its meaning in the specific contexts where it is used in this chapter.

The author is using them together for emphasis. See the further discussion in the introduction to this chapter. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine them. Alternate translation: [The rulers of Jericho were so afraid of the Israelites that they had shut the city gates so that no one could enter, and they had shut up the people inside so that no one could leave]

6:1	vgw6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וִֽ⁠ירִיחוֹ֙ סֹגֶ֣רֶת וּ⁠מְסֻגֶּ֔רֶת	1	The author is using **{was} shutting and {was} being shut up** as a common expression of his culture to mean “shut to those outside and those within.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [No one could go out or into Jericho]
6:1	vrc2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מִ⁠פְּנֵ֖י	1	Here, **from the face of** is a common expression of the culture that means “because of” or “on account of.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning or you could state the meaning plainly.

Joshua says the same thing three times in slightly different ways to emphasize to the Israelite soldiers and priests that they must remain completely silent until he gives them the command, **Shout!** If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine the phrases into one and show the emphasis in another way.

6:13	lxf4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	הֹלְכִ֣ים הָל֔וֹךְ	1	The author is repeating the verb **walking** in order to intensify the idea that it expresses.

Alternate translation: [were walking continually]

7:intro	uv41				0	# Joshua 7 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter describes how the army of the city of Ai, which was much smaller than Jericho, was able to defeat the Israelites because one of them disobeyed Yahweh’s command not to take any plunder from Jericho. The chapter describes how Yahweh identified that person, a man named Achan, and how the Israelites punished him by execution for what he did.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Sin brought defeat\n\nIt was a great sin for Achan to take what Yahweh had said was to be destroyed. Because of his sin, Yahweh withheld victory from the Israelites. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### “devoted”\n\nThe specialized term that the ULT translates as “devoted” occurs several times in this chapter. See the discussion of that term in the Introduction to Joshua, and see the UST for an expression of its meaning in the specific contexts where it is used in this chapter.\n\n### “went up”\n\nAs the Introduction to Joshua discusses, Hebrew writers marked travel descriptions for change in elevation. So the author typically says “went up” when he describes how the Israelite soldiers went from Gilgal in the Jordan River valley to the city of Ai in a hilly area. If your language does not mark travel notices for change in elevation, you can translate these expressions more simply and say “went.”

In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
7:1	v6rb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	וַ⁠יִּמְעֲל֧וּ בְנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֛ל מַ֖עַל	1	For emphasis, the author is using a construction in which a verb and its object come from the same root. You may be able to use the same construction in your language to express the meaning here. Alternatively, your language may have another way of showing the emphasis. The idea is that one Israelite did something secret and deceptive that was a betrayal of the trust that Yahweh had placed in all of the Israelites. Alternate translation: [But the sons of Israel deceptively betrayed Yahweh]
7:1	nby4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בַּ⁠חֵ֑רֶם & הַ⁠חֵ֔רֶם	1	To decide how to translate the term **devoted** in its two instances here and throughout this chapter, see the discussion in the Introduction to Joshua. Also see how you translated the term in [Joshua 2:10](../02/10.md) and in [Joshua 6:17–21](../06/17.md).

7:1	li2v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אַ֥ף יְהוָ֖ה	1	The author is using the **nose** of Yahweh to mean his anger, by association with the way that a person who is angry breathes heavily through his nose. Your language and culture may also associate anger with a particular part of the body. If so, you could use an expression involving that part of the body in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: [the anger of Yahweh]
7:1	j020		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יִּֽחַר	1	The author is speaking as if the **nose** of Yahweh, representing his anger, had actually **burned**. He means that his anger became very intense. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [And … became very intense]
7:2	h9cn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מִ⁠קֶּ֣דֶם לְ⁠בֵֽית־אֵ֔ל	1	The author is describing the location of one place relative to another in the way that is characteristic of his culture.

In your translation, express this in the way your culture describes the relative location of places. Alternate translation: [to the east of Bethel]
7:2	si6l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	עֲל֖וּ & וַֽ⁠יַּעֲלוּ֙ הָ⁠אֲנָשִׁ֔ים	1	As the introduction to this chapter discusses, the expressions **Go up** and **went up** indicate that the Israelite spies had to move upward in elevation in order to spy out Ai.

7:3	xxfc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	כִּ֥י מְעַ֖ט הֵֽמָּה	1	The pronoun **they** refers to the inhabitants of the city of Ai, not to the soldiers in the Israelite army.

Alternate translation: [Shebarim]
7:5	vluc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	הַ⁠שְּׁבָרִ֔ים	1	A quarry is a place from which people take stones to use for building things. Normally, **quarries** are large holes  that go deep in the ground. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of place, you could use a descriptive phrase.

Alternate translation: [did you bring this people across the Jordan at all]

7:23	s59g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לִ⁠פְנֵ֥י יְהוָֽה	1	This could mean: (1) “where Yahweh could see them.” The idea is not that Yahweh did not know their location before; he told Joshua in [Joshua 7:11](../07/11.md) that an Israelite had stolen some of the devoted things and hidden them. Rather, the idea is that this was public evidence that the Israelites had found the wrongdoer and would punish him as Yahweh had told them to. Alternate translation: [where Yahweh could see them]; (2) “in front of the tent of meeting.” The phrase could be a description of where the Israelites **poured … out** the silver coins, coat, and gold wedge. The author would be using the name **Yahweh** by association to mean the place where his presence was. But this would also indicate that these things were serving as conclusive evidence against Achan. Alternate translation: [in front of the tent of meeting]

It means that Joshua and **all Israel with him** brought Achan and his family and possessions to the Valley of Achor. Be sure that this is clear in your translation. The UST models one way to do that.
7:24	ta3l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate	עֵ֥מֶק עָכֽוֹר	1	The Hebrew word **Achor** is the name of a valley. In your translation, you could spell it the way it sounds in your language, or you could use a word or phrase from your language that expresses the meaning of this name.

8:intro	f3jc				0	# Joshua 8 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nJoshua [8:1–29](../08/01.md) describes how the Israelites were able to defeat the army of the city of Ai and destroy that city once they had dealt with Achan’s sin of taking plunder from Jericho. Yahweh told the Israelites how to defeat the city by putting some of their soldiers in an ambush.\n\nJoshua [8:30–35](../08/30.md) then describes how the Israelites affirmed their covenant with Yahweh at Mount Ebal, just as Moses had told them to do.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### The altar on Mount Ebal\n\nBy building an altar on Mount Ebal and writing out a copy of the law on the stones, Joshua was fulfilling what Moses had commanded the Israelites in [Deuteronomy 11:26–32](../../deu/11/26.md) and [27:1–26](../27/01.md). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in a footnote.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Did Joshua put 30,000 or 5,000 soldiers in the ambush?\n\nVerses 3–9 seem to describe Joshua sending 30,000 soldiers to lie in ambush to the west of the city of Ai. But [verse 12](../08/12.md), which seems to be a summary of that same action, says that Joshua sent 5,000 soldiers. Interpreters explain this in different ways. Some say that [verse 12](../08/12.md) is not actually a summary and Joshua sent out two groups for two different purposes, for example, one to rush into the city and another to guard the flank of the main army or to cut off escaping soldiers. Other interpreters suggest that the original 30,000 soldiers may have realized that there were more of them than were needed for the ambush and that they could not all hide without being seen, so they returned to Joshua, and he sent back only 5,000 of them. Still other interpreters suggest that the number 30,000 could be a copyist’s error and that [verse 3](../08/03.md) should actually read “5,000.” Whatever the explanation, it is a matter of interpretation rather than translation. The Hebrew text reads “30,000” in [verse 3](../08/03.md) and “5,000” in [verse 12](../08/12.md), and we encourage you to translate the text that way.\n\n### Descriptions of relative location\n\nIn several places in this chapter, the author describes the location of one place relative to another in the way that is characteristic of his culture. He tells from what direction a person would approach a certain place when traveling from the location in which they had been staying previously. In your translation express this in the way your culture describes the relative location of places. For example, in [8:8](../08/08.md), you might say “to the west of Ai” rather than “from the west of Ai.”
8:1	l4p8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	אַל־תִּירָ֣א וְ⁠אַל־תֵּחָ֔ת	1	The phrases **Do not fear** and **do not be dismayed** mean similar things. Yahweh is using them together to emphasize that Joshua and the Israelite soldiers must not be afraid. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase.

Use a natural form in your language for a summary statement at the end of one section of a story. Be sure that it is clear that this is a summary and not a description of a further action.
8:13	omgf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠אֶת־עֲקֵב֖⁠וֹ מִ⁠יָּ֣ם לָ⁠עִ֑יר	1	The author is speaking of the Israelite army as if it were a foot and the soldiers who hid **west** of Ai as its **heel**. He means that those soldiers were at the edge of the force. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [and the Israelite soldiers who had separated from the main force and hidden on the west side of the city]
8:14	a0rv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כִּ⁠רְא֣וֹת מֶֽלֶךְ־הָ⁠עַ֗י	1	The author does not say specifically what the king of Ai **saw**. This could mean: (1) that the king saw Joshua. The author has just said that Joshua went and spent the night in the valley near Ai, and the king may have seen him in the morning and concluded that this was the main force of the Israelite army and that he could attack and destroy it. Alternate translation: [as soon as the king of Ai saw Joshua]; (2) that the king saw that the Israelite army was north of the city. This could be a more general reference to the king seeing that the Israelites had set up their main camp to the north of the city. Alternate translation: [as soon as the king saw the Israelite army]
8:14	kov9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	וַֽ⁠יְמַהֲר֡וּ וַ⁠יַּשְׁכִּ֡ימוּ	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **hurried** tells in what way the men of the city **got up early**. Alternate translation: [quickly got up early]
8:14	ye1u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עַמּ֛⁠וֹ	1	As in [Joshua 6:5](../06/05.md), the term **people** refers to soldiers. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: [his soldiers] or [his army]
8:15	a7lb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וַ⁠יִּנָּֽגְע֛וּ יְהוֹשֻׁ֥עַ וְ⁠כָל־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you must state who did the action, the context implies that “the men of Ai” did it. Alternate translation: [And the men of Ai struck Joshua and all of Israel]
8:15	rn7s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יִּנָּֽגְע֛וּ יְהוֹשֻׁ֥עַ וְ⁠כָל־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל לִ⁠פְנֵי⁠הֶ֑ם	1	See the section discussing the word “struck” in the Introduction to Joshua and also see the section discussing the phrase “to the face of.” Alternate translation: [And Joshua and all Israel let themselves be driven back] or [And Joshua and all Israel pretended to be defeated before them]
8:16	lcb5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וַ⁠יִּזָּעֲק֗וּ כָּל־הָ⁠עָם֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר ב⁠עיר	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [And the king summoned all of the people who were in the city]
8:16	k8ff		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כָּל־הָ⁠עָם֙	1	In this context, the phrase **the people** refers to the men who were able to fight. It is clear from [Joshua 8:24](../08/24.md) that other people remained in the city. Alternate translation: [all of the fighting men]
8:16	yt5n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וַ⁠יִּנָּתְק֖וּ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [and this drew them away]

Alternate translation: [And every man in Ai and Bethel went out after Israel]
8:17	zip6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אִ֗ישׁ	1	Here, the term **man** refers specifically to the men who were able to fight. They left these two cities to pursue the Israelite army. Older men and those unable to fight because of some physical disability probably did not leave these cities. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: [a man of fighting age] or [a man who could fight]
8:17	gnnz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וּ⁠בֵ֣ית אֵ֔ל	1	The statement that the fighting men of **Bethel** also pursued the Israelites implicitly suggests that Bethel and Ai were allied cities. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: [or in its allied city of Bethel]
8:17	odgx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וַ⁠יַּעַזְב֤וּ אֶת־הָ⁠עִיר֙ פְּתוּחָ֔ה	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

You should retain this action in your translation. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate its meaning in footnote.
8:19	cyya		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	וְ⁠הָ⁠אוֹרֵ֡ב קָם֩ מְהֵרָ֨ה מִ⁠מְּקוֹמ֤⁠וֹ וַ⁠יָּר֨וּצוּ֙	1	The word **ambush** is a singular noun that refers to a group of people acting together. That is why the pronoun **they** is plural. If your language does not use singular nouns in this way, you could describe this **ambush** as a group. Alternate translation: [And the Israelite soldiers who were hiding themselves rose quickly from their place, and they ran]
8:19	brnr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	וַֽ⁠יְמַהֲר֔וּ וַ⁠יַּצִּ֥יתוּ	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **hurried** tells in what way the soldiers from the ambush **burned** the city. Alternate translation: [and they hurriedly burned]
8:19	j7b9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	וַ⁠יַּצִּ֥יתוּ אֶת־הָ⁠עִ֖יר בָּ⁠אֵֽשׁ	1	See how you translated the same expression in [Joshua 8:8](../08/08.md). Alternate translation: [and they set the city on fire]
8:20	lcmy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	וְ⁠הִנֵּ֨ה	1	The author is using the term **behold** to focus attention on what happens next in this story. Your language may have a comparable expression that you could use in your translation.
8:20	vvzs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠לֹא־הָיָ֨ה בָ⁠הֶ֥ם יָדַ֛יִם לָ⁠נ֖וּס הֵ֣נָּה וָ⁠הֵ֑נָּה	1	Here, **hand** represents the capability of a person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. This statement seems to introduce the action that the author describes in the rest of this verse and in the next two verses, in which the soldiers from Ai and Bethel become surrounded by the Israelite soldiers. Alternate translation: [And it was not possible for them to flee here or there]
8:20	d2dq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	הֵ֣נָּה וָ⁠הֵ֑נָּה	1	The author is speaking of two things in order to mean them and everything in between. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [anywhere]
8:22	mxej		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠אֵ֨לֶּה יָצְא֤וּ מִן־הָ⁠עִיר֙ לִ⁠קְרָאתָ֔⁠ם וַ⁠יִּֽהְי֤וּ לְ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ בַּ⁠תָּ֔וֶךְ	1	The pronoun **these** refers to the Israelite soldiers who had been hiding and who had just set the city of Ai on fire. The pronoun **them** refers to the Israelite soldiers who had openly attacked Ai and then pretended to flee, but then turned around to attack their enemies. The pronoun **they** refers to the soldiers who had come out of the cities of Ai and Bethel. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: [And the Israelite soldiers who had been hiding and who had just set the city of Ai on fire came out from the city to meet the Israelite soldiers who had just turned around to attack, so the soldiers who had come out of the cities of Ai and Bethel were in the midst of Israel]
8:22	dlr1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יִּֽהְי֤וּ לְ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ בַּ⁠תָּ֔וֶךְ אֵ֥לֶּה מִ⁠זֶּ֖ה וְ⁠אֵ֣לֶּה מִ⁠זֶּ֑ה	1	The author is using the term **Israel** by association to mean the Israelite army. It is not significant which instance of **here** refers to which body of Israelite soldiers, the one coming from the city or the one coming back from the wilderness. Alternate translation: [so they were in the midst of Israelite soldiers, some coming at them from one direction and others coming at them from the other direction]
8:22	s1lu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יַּכּ֣וּ אוֹתָ֔⁠ם עַד־בִּלְתִּ֥י הִשְׁאִֽיר־ל֖⁠וֹ שָׂרִ֥יד וּ⁠פָלִֽיט	1	After referring to the Israelite soldiers as **they** and the soldiers from Ai and Bethel as **them**, the author then refers to the Israelites as **he** and to their enemies as **him**. This probably reflects the use earlier in the verse of the singular term **Israel** to represent the Israelite soldiers. It may be more natural in your language to use plural pronouns throughout this sentence. Alternate translation: [And they struck them until they left to them no survivor or fugitive]
8:24	dura		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-distinguish	בַּ⁠שָּׂדֶ֗ה בַּ⁠מִּדְבָּר֙	1	By using the terms **field** and **wilderness** together, the author could be: (1) giving further information about where **the field** was located. Alternate translation: [in the field that was in the wilderness]; (2) naming two locations where the Israelite army killed the soldiers from Ai and Bethel. Alternate translation: [in the field and in the wilderness]
8:24	uhnh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַֽ⁠יִּפְּל֥וּ כֻלָּ֛⁠ם	1	The author is describing dying in battle by association with the word **fallen**, since soldiers who die in battle fall to the ground in their dying. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [and all of them had been killed] or [and all of them had died]
8:24	q7gr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יַּכּ֥וּ אֹתָ֖⁠הּ לְ⁠פִי־חָֽרֶב	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [Joshua 6:21](../06/21.md).

Alternate translation: [and killed everyone who lived there]
8:25	d2ud		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הַ⁠נֹּ֨פְלִ֜ים	1	See how you translated the similar expression in the previous verse. Alternate translation: [the ones who were killed]
8:25	s6hq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	כֹּ֖ל אַנְשֵׁ֥י הָ⁠עָֽי	1	While the terms **man** and **woman** earlier in the verse have a specific sense, the masculine term **men** here has a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use language in your translation here that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: [the entire population of the city]
8:26	gcgu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	וִ⁠יהוֹשֻׁ֨עַ֙ לֹֽא־הֵשִׁ֣יב יָד֔⁠וֹ	1	The author is expressing a positive meaning by using a negative word together with a term that is the opposite of the action he wishes to emphasize. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [And Joshua continued holding out his hand]
8:27	jyr5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	רַ֣ק הַ⁠בְּהֵמָ֗ה וּ⁠שְׁלַל֙ הָ⁠עִ֣יר הַ⁠הִ֔יא בָּזְז֥וּ לָ⁠הֶ֖ם יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל	1	The word **However** is introducing a contrast. What follows the word **However** is in contrast to what the Israelites did to the inhabitants of Ai, described in the previous verse. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation: [By contrast, Israel did plunder for themselves the livestock and the spoil of that city]
8:27	agn1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	כִּ⁠דְבַ֣ר יְהוָ֔ה	1	The author is using the term **word** to represent what Yahweh commanded by using words. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [according to the commandment of Yahweh]
8:28	nq1b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	שְׁמָמָ֔ה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **desolation**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [a desolate place]
8:29	yq50		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	עַ֖ד הַ⁠יּ֥וֹם הַ⁠זֶּֽה	1	The author is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If it would be clearer in your language, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: [that remains until this day] or [that is still there at the present time]
8:30	isui		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	אָ֣ז	1	The word **Then** indicates that the event the story will now relate came after the event it has just described. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could show this relationship by using a fuller phrase. Alternate translation: [After that,] or [After raising a great pile of stones over the corpse of the king of Ai,]
8:31	td7f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	כַּ⁠כָּתוּב֙ בְּ⁠סֵ֨פֶר֙ תּוֹרַ֣ת מֹשֶׁ֔ה	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [as the Book of the Law of Moses says] or [as Moses wrote in his Book of the Law]
8:31	ihwd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	אֲשֶׁ֛ר לֹֽא־הֵנִ֥יף עֲלֵי⁠הֶ֖ן בַּרְזֶ֑ל	1	The author is quoting Yahweh’s words to Moses in [Exodus 20:25](../../exo/20/25.md) where Yahweh uses the first part of a process to mean that entire process. Picking up an **iron tool** and holding it over a stone is the first step in using that tool to shape the stone. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [which no one has used an iron tool to shape]
8:33	cool		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מִ⁠זֶּ֣ה ׀ וּ⁠מִ⁠זֶּ֣ה ׀ לָ⁠אָר֡וֹן	1	As the introduction to this chapter discusses, the author is describing the location of one place relative to another in the way that is characteristic of his culture.

8:33	vffb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	חֶצְי⁠וֹ֙ & וְ⁠הַֽ⁠חֶצְי֖⁠וֹ	1	The pronoun **him** in both instances refers to **Israel**, which means all of the Israelites. It may be more natural in your language to use plural pronouns. Alternate translation: [half of them … and half of them]
8:33	wd9u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	בָּ⁠רִאשֹׁנָֽה	1	The author is using the adjective **first** as a noun. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this adjective with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: [when he first delivered the law]
8:34	vf71		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	הַ⁠כָּת֖וּב	1	If your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could express this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [that Moses had written]

Alternate translation: [Joshua read every word that Moses had commanded]
8:35	ozlo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠הַ⁠נָּשִׁ֣ים וְ⁠הַ⁠טַּ֔ף וְ⁠הַ⁠גֵּ֖ר	1	The author is making clear that on this occasion the **assembly of Israel** did not consist only of male representatives of tribes or clans or extended families, but that it also included **women** and **children** and **sojourners**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could indicate this explicitly in your translation. Alternate translation: [including all of the women and children and all of the sojourners]
9:intro	w1cx				0	# Joshua 9 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter describes how the people of the city of Gibeon deceived the Israelites into making a peace treaty with them.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### How the Israelites were deceived\n\nThe Israelites were deceived because “they did not ask the mouth of Yahweh” ([Joshua 9:14](../09/14.md)), that is, they did not ask Yahweh for guidance. Instead of consulting Yahweh, they reached conclusions of their own based on what they considered to be reasonable in light of the evidence they had. The Bible says instead, in [Proverbs 3:5](../../pro/03/05.md) “Trust in Yahweh with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding.” (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/inquire]])\n\n### The Hivites\n\nIn [Joshua 3:10](../03/10.md), the Israelites are given a list of the nations that they are told to dispossess from the land. This list includes the Hivites. In [Joshua 9:1–2](../09/01.md), the author of Joshua records that when the kings on the west side of the Jordan River heard what the Israelites had done to Ai, they made an agreement to fight against the Israelites. The list in [Joshua 9:2](../09/02.md) of kings who agreed to fight against the Israelites includes “the Hivite.” The author records in [Joshua 9:3–4](../09/03.md) that when “those who dwelled in Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and to the Ai … they … acted with cunning.” The author then records in [Joshua 9:7](../09/07.md) that those who dwelled in Gibeon were “Hivite.” The Hivite nation consisted of multiple people groups, of whom the Gibeonites were just one. This is why the author could say in [Joshua 9:1–2](../09/01.md) that among the kings who gathered to fight the Israelites were Hivites, and also say that the Gibeonites were Hivites.\n\n### “Cut a covenant”\n\nThe phrase “cut a covenant” occurs several times in this chapter. It means “make a covenant.” The word “cut” is used because in some covenant ceremonies, the participants would cut up animals and then walk between the pieces. This was to indicate, “If I break this covenant, may I be destroyed in this same way.” It is not necessary to understand this background of covenant ceremonies in order to understand the action in this chapter, so you do not have to use the term “cut” in your translation. You could simply say “make,” or you could use an expression from your own language and culture.
9:1	j011		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בְּ⁠עֵ֨בֶר הַ⁠יַּרְדֵּ֜ן	1	The description that follows indicates that by **the other side of the Jordan**, the author means the side opposite to the one from which the Israelites approached the land of Canaan. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [were on the west side of the Jordan River]
9:1	j022		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	הַֽ⁠חִתִּי֙ וְ⁠הָ֣⁠אֱמֹרִ֔י הַֽ⁠כְּנַעֲנִי֙ הַ⁠פְּרִזִּ֔י הַ⁠חִוִּ֖י וְ⁠הַ⁠יְבוּסִֽי	1	The author is not referring to specific individuals. He is describing the people groups that these **kings** ruled. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using plural forms. Alternate translation: [that is, the kings of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites]
9:2	uj94		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	פֶּ֖ה אֶחָֽד	1	The author is using a common expression of his culture, **as one mouth**, to mean “by unanimous agreement.” (All the kings said the same thing, that they would fight the Israelites, so it was as if together they only had one mouth.) If it would be clearer in your language, you could use an equivalent idiom or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [by unanimous agreement]
9:4	r5yb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וַ⁠יַּעֲשׂ֤וּ גַם־הֵ֨מָּה֙ בְּ⁠עָרְמָ֔ה	1	The word **also** does not indicate that the other kings had acted **with cunning** and the people of Gibeon did the same. Rather, the idea is that the other kings acted by joining forces to fight the Israelites, and the people of Gibeon **also** acted, but **with cunning** rather than by fighting. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: [And they also took action, but unlike the other kings, they did not prepare to fight; they used cunning]
9:4	aktq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	בְּ⁠עָרְמָ֔ה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **cunning**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [craftily]

9:6	rz8e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	אִ֣ישׁ יִשְׂרָאֵ֗ל	1	The author is not referring to a specific **man**. He means the men **of Israel** in general and, as [verses 15](../09/15.md) and [18–21](../09/18.md) indicate, most likely the leaders of Israel. Alternate translation: [the leaders of Israel]
9:6	uh11		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠עַתָּ֖ה	1	See how you translated in [Joshua 1:2](../01/02.md) this expression that people of this time used to introduce the main business of a message.
9:6	mo5f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כִּרְתוּ־לָ֥⁠נוּ בְרִֽית	1	See the discussion of this phrase in the introduction to this chapter. Alternate translation: [make a covenant with us]

9:7	ojg7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	הַ⁠חִוִּ֑י	1	The author is not referring to one **Hivite**. He means the Gibeonite messengers, who were Hivites. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: [these Hivites] or [the Hivites]
9:7	t1r4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וְ⁠אֵ֖יךְ אֶֽכְרָת־לְ⁠ךָ֥ בְרִֽית	1	The Israelite leaders are using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [In that case, we could not cut a covenant with you!]
9:8	ki9n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עֲבָדֶ֣י⁠ךָ אֲנָ֑חְנוּ	1	By saying **We are your servants**, the Gibeonites do not mean that they are willing to become slaves, such as they eventually do become in this episode. Rather, they are agreeing to let Joshua be their ruler. They mean implicitly that they will accept the terms he specifies, such as paying tribute. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [We are willing to serve you as our ruler]
9:9	mrhs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	מֵ⁠אֶ֨רֶץ רְחוֹקָ֤ה מְאֹד֙ בָּ֣אוּ עֲבָדֶ֔י⁠ךָ לְ⁠שֵׁ֖ם יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: [Because of the name of Yahweh your God, your servants have come from a very distant land]
9:9	kvs5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	עֲבָדֶ֔י⁠ךָ	1	To show respect to Joshua, the Gibeonites are speaking about themselves in the third person. They are not assuming that he has already agreed to let them serve him as their ruler. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person.

Use the appropriate punctuation in your language to mark these levels of quotation. Alternatively, you could translate this so that there is not a third-level quotation (see the Quotes within Quotes note).

The author says the same thing twice, in slightly different ways, to emphasize that the Gibeonites lived close to the Israelites. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine the phrases into one and show the emphasis in a way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [that they heard that they actually lived close to them!] or [that they discovered that they actually lived close to them!]

9:19	vrwa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אֲנַ֨חְנוּ֙ נִשְׁבַּ֣עְנוּ	1	The leaders are stating the pronoun **We** separately, even though the verb translated as **we have sworn** already includes this meaning. They are doing that to emphasize their personal role in the action of having sworn this oath to the Gibeonites. If speakers of your language would use an explicit pronoun for the same purpose, you may want to use that construction in your translation. If not, your language may have other ways of showing the meaning here. Alternate translation: [We swore personally]

The other two instances of **your** and the word **you** are plural because the Gibeonites are referring to the Israelites as a group. Use the corresponding forms in your translation if your language marks this distinction.
9:24	kbti		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מִ⁠פְּנֵי⁠כֶ֔ם	1	The Gibeonites are using a common expression of the culture, **from the face of** that means “because of” or “on account of.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning or you could state the meaning plainly.

10:intro	uy1f				0	# Joshua 10 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter describes how other Canaanite kings attacked the city of Gibeon because it was a great city and they were concerned because its people had allied themselves with the Israelites. The chapter also describes how Joshua and the Israelite army went and defended the city and defeated its attackers ([Joshua 10:1–27](../10/01.md)).\n\nThe chapter then describes how Joshua and the Israelite army defeated and destroyed each of the cities whose kings had attacked Gibeon, the cities of Makkedah, Libnah, Lachish, Eglon, Hebron, and Debir ([Joshua 10:28–43](../10/28.md)).\n\nThe ULT sets the lines in [Joshua 10:12–13](../10/12.md) farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text because they are a poem.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Complete destruction of cities\n\nThe war that the Israelites fought against the Canaanites was different from other wars. Yahweh gave Israel special instructions about how they were to deal with the people they defeated, including completely destroying them and their cities. These were unique circumstances, and armies today are not supposed to act in the same way.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### “devoted”\n\nThe specialized term that the ULT translates as “devoted” occurs several times in this chapter. See the discussion of that term in the Introduction to Joshua, and see the UST for an expression of its meaning in the specific contexts where it is used in this chapter.\n\n### “to the mouth of the sword”\n\nThis expression occurs several times in this chapter, often in connection with the term “devoted.” See the discussion of this expression in the Introduction to Joshua, and see how the UST represents its meaning.\n\n### “come up,” “went up”\n\nAs the Introduction to Joshua discusses, Hebrew writers marked travel descriptions for change in elevation. The author follows this usage in several places in this chapter. If your language does not mark travel notices for change in elevation, you can translate these expressions more simply For example, in [Joshua 10:6](../10/06.md) you might have the Gibeonites say simply “come to us” rather than “come up to us.”
10:1	m2j4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יַּחֲרִימָ⁠הּ֒	1	See the discussion of the term **devoted** in the introduction to this chapter. Alternate translation: [and had completely destroyed it]

This first phrase would then be at the end of the verse. Alternate translation: [then they feared greatly]
10:2	p7w9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יִּֽירְא֣וּ מְאֹ֔ד	1	The pronoun **they** refers both to the king of Jerusalem, mentioned in the previous verse, and to the people who lived in that city. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: [the people of Jerusalem and their king feared greatly]
10:2	a3f6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	עָרֵ֣י הַ⁠מַּמְלָכָ֑ה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **kingdom**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [the cities that a king ruled]
10:4	e2v7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	עֲלֽוּ	1	As the Introduction to Joshua discusses, in Hebrew, writers and speakers generally indicated whether people were going up to a higher elevation or going down to a lower elevation when they traveled. If your language does not mark travel for change in elevation, you can translate such expressions more simply. Alternate translation: [Come]

10:5	m7y3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מַֽחֲנֵי⁠הֶ֑ם	1	The author is using the term **camps** by association to mean the armies that stayed in camps during military campaigns.

10:8	p8t4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	בְ⁠יָדְ⁠ךָ֖ נְתַתִּ֑י⁠ם	1	Yahweh is using the past tense to describe something that is going to happen in the future in order to show that the event will certainly happen.

10:8	m9x5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְ⁠יָדְ⁠ךָ֖	1	As the introduction to this chapter discusses, the author is using the term **hand** by association to mean power or control.

Alternate translation: [and he struck them severely]
10:10	n7k3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	בֵית־חוֹרֹ֔ן & עֲזֵקָ֖ה & מַקֵּדָֽה	1	The words **Beth Horon**, **Azekah**, and **Makkedah** are the names of cities.
10:11	s5m8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠נֻסָ֣⁠ם ׀ מִ⁠פְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֗ל	1	The author is using the expression **the face of** by association to mean “in front of.” Since the fleeing enemies were in front of the Israelites, the Israelites were behind them, and it may be more natural in your language to express the meaning that way. Alternate translation: [as they were fleeing, with the Israelites pursuing closely behind them]
10:11	e9v4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֲבָנִ֨ים גְּדֹל֧וֹת מִן־הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֛יִם	1	As the author indicates later in the verse, these were not **stones** in the sense of rocks, but **hail** stones.

10:12	i3k7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בְּ⁠י֗וֹם תֵּ֤ת יְהוָה֙ אֶת־הָ֣⁠אֱמֹרִ֔י לִ⁠פְנֵ֖י בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל	1	The author is using a common expression to mean that Yahweh enabled the Israelites to defeat the Amorites.

10:12	g5n2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	אֶת־הָ֣⁠אֱמֹרִ֔י	1	The author is not referring to a specific **Amorite**. He means all of these Amorites who opposed Joshua.

10:12	m8p4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לְ⁠עֵינֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֗ל	1	The author is using the term **eyes** by association to mean witnessing or watching.

11:intro	g8mw				0	# Joshua 11 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter describes how the Israelites fought a great battle near the city of Merom and defeated a coalition of the armies of the kings who ruled cities in the northern part of the land of Canaan.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Why did Joshua not burn the cities that had been built on mounds?\n\nJoshua [11:13](../11/13.md) says that while Joshua and the Israelite army burned down most of the cities they conquered, they did not burn any of the cities that had been built on mounds or hills, except for Hazor. This was probably because the elevated location of those cities offered the Israelites a strategic advantage. Those cities probably already had defensive walls. So Yahweh allowed them to live in those cities, where they would be safer and more secure from attack. It is not necessary to put anything about this in the text of your translation, but you could explain it in a footnote.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### “devoted,” “to the mouth of the sword”\n\nThe author uses these expressions several times in this chapter. See the discussion of them in the Introduction to Joshua.

13:intro	zl7s				0	# Joshua 13 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nIn this chapter, the author begins to describe how Joshua divided among the various tribes the land the Israelites conquered. (This description continues through Chapter 21.) This chapter summarizes the land that remained for the Israelites to conquer ([13:1–7](../13/01.md)) and reviews how Moses distributed the land the Israelites conquered east of the Jordan River to some of the tribes ([13:8–32](../13/08.md)).\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\nSee Part 4 of the Introduction to Joshua for a discussion of translation issues specific to the descriptions in Chapters 13–21 of territories and their borders. These issues include:\n1. The author uses the idea of “inheritance” to mean a lasting possession that would be passed down to future generations.\n2. The author marks travel for change in elevation. He says, for example, “went up” or “went down” rather than just “went.”\n3. The author describes the location of one place relative to another in the way that is characteristic of his culture. Specifically, he says the direction from which someone would be approaching a new location when coming from a location he has already named.\n4. The author often says simply “the sea” when he means the Mediterranean Sea, which he calls the Great Sea when he names it.\n5. The author often uses the term “sea” by association to mean the direction of the Mediterranean Sea, that is, from his perspective, the west.\n6. Similarly, the author often uses the term “sunrise” by association to mean the direction in which the sun rises, that is, the east.\n7. All names in border descriptions and lists are the names of cities and towns unless otherwise indicated in the biblical text, in a note, or in the UST.

14:intro	dsn7				0	# Joshua 14 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the description of how Joshua divided up among the various tribes the land the Israelites conquered. It begins to describe the division of the land west of the Jordan River ([Joshua 14:1–5](../14/01.md)), and it relates how Joshua gave the city of Hebron and the surrounding area to Caleb ([Joshua 14:6–15](../14/06.md)).\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\nSee Part 4 of the Introduction to Joshua for a discussion of translation issues specific to the descriptions in Chapters 13–21 of territories and their borders. These issues include:\n1. The author uses the idea of “inheritance” to mean a lasting possession that would be passed down to future generations.\n2. The author marks travel for change in elevation. He says, for example, “went up” or “went down” rather than just “went.”\n3. The author describes the location of one place relative to another in the way that is characteristic of his culture. Specifically, he says the direction from which someone would be approaching a new location when coming from a location he has already named.\n4. The author often says simply “the sea” when he means the Mediterranean Sea, which he calls the Great Sea when he names it.\n5. The author often uses the term “sea” by association to mean the direction of the Mediterranean Sea, that is, from his perspective, the west.\n6. Similarly, the author often uses the term “sunrise” by association to mean the direction in which the sun rises, that is, the east.\n7. All names in border descriptions and lists are the names of cities and towns unless otherwise indicated in the biblical text, in a note, or in the UST.

15:13	b8p5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	אֶת־קִרְיַ֥ת אַרְבַּ֛ע אֲבִ֥י הָ⁠עֲנָ֖ק הִ֥יא חֶבְרֽוֹן	1	See how you presented the similar background information that the author provides in [Joshua 14:15](../14/15.md) about the former and current name of this city.
15:14	m2n9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֶת־שְׁלוֹשָׁ֖ה בְּנֵ֣י הָ⁠עֲנָ֑ק אֶת־שֵׁשַׁ֤י וְ⁠אֶת־אֲחִימַן֙ וְ⁠אֶת־תַּלְמַ֔י יְלִידֵ֖י הָ⁠עֲנָֽק	1	The author is using the term **sons** to refer to the three clans that were descended from a man named **Anak**. He is using the term **children** to mean “descendants.” Alternate translation: [the three Anakite clans of Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai, who were all descendants of Anak]
15:15	b5k4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וְ⁠שֵׁם־דְּבִ֥ר לְ⁠פָנִ֖ים קִרְיַת־סֵֽפֶר	1	The author is providing background information to help readers understand that **Debir** was formerly known as **Kiriath Sepher**. In your translation, present this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
15:17	p7n3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יִּתֶּן	1	The pronoun **he** refers to Caleb. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: [So Caleb gave]
15:18	j042		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וַ⁠יְהִ֣י	1	The author is using this phrase to introduce background information that is not part of the main narrative. In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
15:18	j043		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בְּ⁠בוֹאָ֗⁠הּ	1	The author assumes that his readers will understand what he means by this phrase. This could mean: (1) that Achsah came to Kiriath Sepher in order to marry Othniel and that she made this **request** when she arrived and saw the land that Caleb had given to him. Alternate translation: [when Achsah arrived at Kiriath Sepher]; (2) that the author is using this expression to describe Achsah entering Othniel’s household as his wife. Alternate translation: [once Achsah had married Othniel]
15:18	j044		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠תְּסִיתֵ֨⁠הוּ֙ לִ⁠שְׁא֤וֹל מֵֽ⁠אֵת־אָבִ֨י⁠הָ֙ שָׂדֶ֔ה	1	The author is leaving implicit who was to make this request. The meaning does not seem to be that Achsah persuaded Othniel that he should **request** this **field** from Caleb, since he is not the one who asks; she is. In this culture, a young man such as Othniel may not have had the standing to make this kind of request from a leader such as Caleb. So the meaning seems to be that Achsah persuaded Othniel that she should ask for the field. In this culture, a daughter may have been able to make such a request of her father. Alternate translation: [that she persuaded him to allow her to request the field]
15:18	j045		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מֵֽ⁠אֵת־אָבִ֨י⁠הָ֙ שָׂדֶ֔ה	1	The author has a particular **field** in view. The narrative suggests implicitly that Caleb had given some land to Othniel but that it was arid territory. It suggests further that near this land, there was some ground that was suitable for cultivation because it was watered by springs. You could state this information explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [from her father some land that was nearby the land that he had already given to Othniel and that was watered by springs and so could be cultivated]
15:18	j046		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	מַה־לָּֽ⁠ךְ	1	Caleb is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: [What would you like me to do for you?]
15:19	j047		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	תְּנָ⁠ה	1	This is an imperative, but it communicates a polite request rather than a command. Use a form in your language that communicates a polite request. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: [Please give]
15:19	j048		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	בְרָכָ֗ה	1	In this context, the word **blessing** is an abstract noun. It does not refer to something that someone would say to cause good and beneficial things to happen to a person. Instead, it refers to a good and beneficial thing itself. If your language does not use abstract nouns in this way, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [something that will benefit me]
15:19	j049		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	וְ⁠נָתַתָּ֥ה לִ֖⁠י	1	Achsah is using a verb form that could either indicate what a person ought to do or what a person is going to do. This could mean: (1) that since the land Caleb gave Achsah and Othniel was dry, he also ought to give them some land with springs of water. Alternate translation: [you should also give me]; (2) that Achsah is answering Caleb’s question and this is implicitly her request. Alternate translation: [my request is that you will also give me]
15:19	j050		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	גֻּלֹּ֣ת מָ֑יִם & אֵ֚ת גֻּלֹּ֣ת עִלִּיּ֔וֹת וְ⁠אֵ֖ת גֻּלֹּ֥ת תַּחְתִּיּֽוֹת	1	Achsah and the author are using these expressions to mean by association the land on which these **springs** were located. Alternate translation: [some land that has springs of waters … some land in that area where there were upper springs and lower springs]
15:19	j051		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	גֻּלֹּ֣ת מָ֑יִם	1	It might seem that this expression contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in your language. If so, you can shorten it. Alternate translation: [springs] or [land on which there are springs]
15:20	e4n7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	זֹ֗את נַחֲלַ֛ת	1	As the Introduction to Joshua discusses, the author is using the term **inheritance** by association to mean a lasting possession that would be passed down to future generations. Alternate translation: [The following cities became the possession of]
15:21	m7k3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִ⁠קְצֵה֙ לְ⁠מַטֵּ֣ה	1	The author is using the term **tribe** by association to mean the territory that belonged to this tribe. The context shows that by **end**, he means the southern end. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [at the southern end of the territory of the tribe of]
15:21	n5p8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	קַבְצְאֵ֥ל וְ⁠עֵ֖דֶר וְ⁠יָגֽוּר	1	As the Introduction to Joshua discusses, these names and all of the other names in [verses 22–62](../15/22.md) are the names of cities unless the text indicates otherwise with expressions such as “the wadi of Egypt” or “the Great Sea” as in [Joshua 15:47](../15/47.md).
15:25	b3k6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וּ⁠קְרִיּ֔וֹת חֶצְר֖וֹן הִ֥יא חָצֽוֹר	1	The author is providing background information to help readers understand that the city formerly known as **Kerioth Hezron** is the one they know as **Hazor**. In your translation, present this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
15:32	e8m4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כָּל־עָרִ֛ים	1	The author assumes that readers will know he means the **cities** in the southern part of Judah’s territory. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [All of the cities in the southern part of the territory of Judah]
15:33	e2p7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	בַּ⁠שְּׁפֵלָ֑ה	1	The author is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: [These were the cities in the lowlands of the territory of Judah]
15:45	o14c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ⁠בְנֹתֶ֖י⁠הָ	1	Here the author speaks of the city of **Ekron** as if it were a woman, and the surrounding small towns that were dependent on **Ekron** as if they were its **daughters**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [and its surrounding settlements]
15:46	j065		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	עַל־יַ֥ד אַשְׁדּ֖וֹד	1	The author is using the expression **on the hand of** by association to mean “near” or “close by.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [were nearby Ashdod]
15:47	isni		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בְּנוֹתֶ֣י⁠הָ & בְּנוֹתֶ֥י⁠הָ	1	See how you translated this expression in [Joshua 15:45](../15/45.md) where it is used with the same meaning. Alternate translation: [its surrounding settlements … its surrounding settlements]

16:intro	bpv3				0	# Joshua 16 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the description of how Joshua divided up among the various tribes the land the Israelites conquered. It begins to describe how Joshua gave land west of the Jordan River to the two tribes that were descendants of Joseph ([16:1–4](../16/01.md)), starting with the tribe of Ephraim ([16:5–10](../16/05.md)).\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\nSee Part 4 of the Introduction to Joshua for a discussion of translation issues specific to the descriptions in Chapters 13–21 of territories and their borders. These issues include:\n1. The author uses the idea of “inheritance” to mean a lasting possession that would be passed down to future generations.\n2. The author marks travel for change in elevation. He says, for example, “went up” or “went down” rather than just “went.”\n3. The author describes the location of one place relative to another in the way that is characteristic of his culture. Specifically, he says the direction from which someone would be approaching a new location when coming from a location he has already named.\n4. The author often says simply “the sea” when he means the Mediterranean Sea, which he calls the Great Sea when he names it.\n5. The author often uses the term “sea” by association to mean the direction of the Mediterranean Sea, that is, from his perspective, the west.\n6. Similarly, the author often uses the term “sunrise” by association to mean the direction in which the sun rises, that is, the east.\n7. All names in border descriptions and lists are the names of cities and towns unless otherwise indicated in the biblical text, in a note, or in the UST.

16:2	otie		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	מִ⁠בֵּֽית־אֵ֖ל ל֑וּזָ⁠ה	1	As the Introduction to Joshua discusses, all names in border descriptions and lists, such as are found in this chapter, are the names of cities and towns unless otherwise indicated in the biblical text, in a note, or in the UST.

16:9	j067		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	הַ⁠מִּבְדָּלוֹת֙	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [that the Israelite leaders set apart]

In your translation, present this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
17:9	e7k4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יְהִ֥י תֹצְאֹתָ֖י⁠ו הַ⁠יָּֽמָּ⁠ה	1	As the Introduction to Joshua discusses, when the author says **seaward**, typically he is referring to the Mediterranean Sea (known as the Great Sea). You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [and the border ended at the Great Sea]

17:11	e9p4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	שְׁלֹ֖שֶׁת הַ⁠נָּֽפֶת	1	This could mean: (1) that the last three cities mentioned, **En Dor**, **Taanach**, and **Megiddo**, were located on heights. They were all near the city of **Dor**, and they may have been considered part of the “heights of Dor” mentioned in [Joshua 11:2](../11/02.md). Alternate translation: [these last three cities being in the heights of Dor]; (2) that the author wants readers to recognize that the city he calls **Dor** was also known as Naphoth Dor. The word translated as **a height** could be a proper name, Naphoth. Alternate translation: [the third city on this list also being known as Naphoth Dor]
17:12	g4k7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	הַֽ⁠כְּנַעֲנִ֔י	1	The author is not referring to a specific **Canaanite**. He means the Canaanite people group in general.

Those would have been too heavy for any practical use in warfare anyway. It is probably a reference by association to chariots whose wheels or floor were strengthened with iron or which had iron studs or points to make them more destructive when used in ramming. Alternate translation: [and chariots fitted out with iron are with every Canaanite]

It begins the description of how Joshua gave land west of the Jordan River to the remaining tribes of Israel:\n  * Joshua sent men to survey and divide the remaining land ([Joshua 18:1–10](../18/01.md))\n  * Joshua assigned land to the tribe of Benjamin ([Joshua 18:11–28](../18/11.md))\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\nSee Part 4 of the Introduction to Joshua for a discussion of translation issues specific to the descriptions in Chapters 13–21 of territories and their borders. These issues include:\n1. The author uses the idea of “inheritance” to mean a lasting possession that would be passed down to future generations.\n2. The author marks travel for change in elevation. He says, for example, “went up” or “went down” rather than just “went.”\n3. The author describes the location of one place relative to another in the way that is characteristic of his culture. Specifically, he says the direction from which someone would be approaching a new location when coming from a location he has already named.\n4. The author often says simply “the sea” when he means the Mediterranean Sea, which he calls the Great Sea when he names it.\n5. The author often uses the term “sea” by association to mean the direction of the Mediterranean Sea, that is, from his perspective, the west.\n6. Similarly, the author often uses the term “sunrise” by association to mean the direction in which the sun rises, that is, the east.\n7. All names in border descriptions and lists are the names of cities and towns unless otherwise indicated in the biblical text, in a note, or in the UST.

20:intro	vg5f				0	# Joshua 20 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter continues the description of how Joshua divided up the land the Israelites conquered. It describes how Joshua designated certain cities to be cities of refuge ([20:1–9](../20/01.md)).\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Cities of refuge\n\nIf a person was murdered, in this culture it was the duty of his relatives to provide justice by killing the murderer. However, if someone was killed by accident, it would be unjust to kill the person who had killed him accidentally. Therefore, God told the Israelites to designate “cities of refuge” to which a person who killed someone accidentally could flee. In those cities, these cases would be resolved legally. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/refuge]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/avenge]])\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Quotes in quotes\n\nIn [verses 2–6](../20/02.md), there is a long quotation within a quotation. Yahweh tells Joshua something that he is to tell the people of Israel. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Notes suggest how to do that in the cases of [verses 2](../20/02.md) and [3](../20/03.md). The rest of the second-level quotation can be made a first-level quotation without any changes in the wording.\n\n### Relative locations\n\nIn listing the cities of refuge, the author often describes the location of one place relative to another in the way that is characteristic of his culture. Specifically, he says the direction from which someone would be approaching a new location when coming from a location he has already named. Translate these descriptions the way you have done in the previous part of this section of the book of Joshua.

22:intro	l4hr				0	# Joshua 22 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter describes how Joshua dismissed the armies of the tribes that had settled on the east side of the Jordan River. It also describes how they built an altar to remind their descendants to worship Yahweh and how they resolved a misunderstanding about this altar with the other Israelites ([22:1–34](../22/01.md)).\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Quotations within quotations\n\nIn [verses 16–20](../22/16.md) and [22–29](../22/22.md), there are long quotations that include quotations within quotations and, in [verses 24–25](../22/24.md), [27](../22/27.md), and [28](../22/28.md), quotations within quotations within quotations. If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate these so that there are not a quotations within quotations. Notes suggest ways to do this.\n\n### “the sons of Israel”\n\nWhile this phrase typically refers to all of the Israelites, in this chapter it means specifically the people of the tribes that settled on the west side of the Jordan River. Be sure that this meaning is clear in your translation.\n\n### “brothers”\n\nIn this chapter, Joshua and the author use the term “brothers” to mean people who are descended from the same ancestor. In your translation, you may wish to communicate this meaning by using an expression such as “fellow Israelites.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### “tents”\n\nJoshua uses the name of one kind of dwelling, “tents,” to mean all kinds of dwellings. In your translation, you may wish to communicate this meaning by using a word such as “homes.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])\n\n### “tomorrow”\n\nIn this chapter, characters use the word “tomorrow” several times to mean “in the future.” You may wish to use that phrase in your translation to communicate the meaning.

24:intro	yqa8				0	# Joshua 24 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter describes how Joshua had the Israelites gather in the city of Shechem to renew their covenant with Yahweh ([24:1–28](../24/01.md)). It then describes how Joshua died and was buried and how the Israelites also buried the remains of other leaders who had died ([24:29–33](../24/29.md)).\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### “Cut a covenant”\n\nThe phrase “cut a covenant” occurs in this chapter, as it did several times in Chapter 9. It means “make a covenant.” The word “cut” is used because in some covenant ceremonies, the participants would cut up animals and then walk between the pieces. This was to indicate, “If I break this covenant, may I be destroyed in this same way.” It is not necessary to understand this background to covenant ceremonies in order to understand the action in this chapter, so you do not have to use the term “cut” in your translation. You could simply say “make,” or you could use an expression from your own language and culture.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### “you,” “your”\n\nYahweh, speaking through Joshua, often addresses the current generation of Israelites with the pronouns “you” and “your,” as if he had done the things he describes directly for them. Yahweh is actually using those pronouns to refer to the ancestors of the Israelites, the people whom he brought out of Egypt, by association with the current generation. In your translation, you could express this meaning by using expressions such as “your ancestors.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])\n\n### “fathers”\n\nOften in this chapter, Yahweh speaks of the ancestors of the Israelites he is addressing as if they were their actual “fathers.” In your translation, you could express this meaning by using a term such as “ancestors.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### “the Amorite,” “the foreigner,” etc.\n\nOften in this chapter, Yahweh and Joshua use expressions such as “the Amorite.” They are not referring to a specific Amorite. They mean the Amorite people in general. The meaning is also general in similar instances, including “the foreigner” in [verses 20](../24/20.md) and [23](../24/23.md). It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using plural forms. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
