History of the judges of Israel ([3:7–16:31](../03/01.md))\n Othniel, Ehud, and Shamgar ([3:7–31](../03/07.md))\n Deborah and Barak ([4:1–5:31](../04/01.md))\n Gideon ([6:1–8:35](../06/01.md))\n Abimelech ([9:1–57](../09/01.md))\n Tola and Jair ([10:1–5](../10/01.md))\n Jephthah ([10:6–12:7](../10/01.md))\n Ibzan, Elon, and Abdon ([12:8–15](../12/08.md))\n Samson ([13:1–16:31](../13/01.md))\n3. Dan becomes a center of idolatry ([17:1–18:31](../17/01.md))\n4. Outrage at Gibeah, civil war against Benjamin ([19:1–21:25](../19/01.md))\n\n### What is the book of Judges about?\n\nThe book of Judges tells of events that occurred after the Israelites settled in the land of Canaan. The events in this book happened over a period of about 150 years. The book continues the biblical narrative directly from the book of Joshua. It begins, “After the death of Joshua,” resuming the story at the point it had reached at the end of the book of Joshua.\n\nThis book describes how the Israelites repeatedly sinned against Yahweh during this time. They worshiped false gods and did the same wicked things as the peoples who lived around them. Therefore, God would allow enemies to defeat and oppress the Israelites. Eventually, the Israelites would call to Yahweh for help. Yahweh would then cause someone to help the Israelites defeat their enemies. This person was called a “judge.” The Israelites would live in peace until the judge died. After that judge died, the Israelites would start sinning again. So this pattern of events would repeat.\n\n### What title should translators give this book?\n\nThis book has traditionally had the title “Judges” because it gives accounts of some of the main leaders or judges in Israel before there were any kings ruling the people. Unless a translation of the Bible exists in your region that uses a different title, you should probably use the title “Judges” or a similar title such as “The Book about the Leaders in Israel.”\n\n## Part 2: Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Book\n\n### What kind of leaders were the judges?\n\nThe judges were men and women whom God chose to help the Israelites defeat their enemies. Afterward these leaders usually continued to help the people by deciding disputes among them. They also helped them make important decisions. Many of these leaders served all the people of Israel, but some of these leaders may have served only certain tribes.\n\n### What kind of society was Israel during the time of the judges?\n\nDuring this time, the twelve tribes of Israel were independent of one another. They were not a unified nation with one ruler. However, they were descendants of the same ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. They also shared in the same covenant with Yahweh. So the tribes would often help each other when enemies were threatening them. However, the book of Judges tells of some times when the tribes fought against each other.\n\n## Part 3: Translation Issues in This Book\n\n### “the angel of Yahweh”\n\nIn many places in the book, the author speaks of a character whom he calls “the angel of Yahweh.” Interpreters are unsure about the exact identity of this character. When he speaks, sometimes the author says “the angel said” and sometimes the author says “Yahweh said.” So he is closely identified with Yahweh in some way, although it is not clear in precisely what way. We recommend that you translate this phrase using the same words that you use in the rest of your translation for “angel” and “Yahweh.” The UST models one way to do this.\n\n### “arose”\n\nIn many contexts, the author uses the expression “arose” to mean that a person took action or took on a particular role. It does not mean that he or she stood up from a sitting or lying position. Similarly, characters sometimes tell other characters to “arise,” meaning that they should take action. Notes will help clarify what the expression means in specific contexts. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])\n\n### “behold”\n\nThe author and characters often use the word “behold” to focus their listeners’ attention on what they are about to say. While the word literally means “look,” the speakers do not want their listeners to look at something, but to pay careful attention. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### “in the eyes of”\n\nThe author and characters often use the common expression “in the eyes of” to mean in someone’s estimation, opinion, or judgment. For example, the author says in [2:11](../02/11.md) that the Israelites “did evil in the eyes of Yahweh,” meaning that they did what Yahweh considered wrong and had said was wrong. Samson says to his parents in [14:3](../14/03.md) about the woman he wants to marry, “she is right in my eyes,” meaning that he thinks she is the right one for him. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])\n\n### “to the face of”\n\nThe author and characters often use the word “face” to represent the presence of a person or group, by association with the way people can see the face of someone who is present. The expression “to the face of” can have different shades of meaning, depending on the context. The focus may be more on the presence of a person, such as in [20:26](../20/26.md), where the author says that the Israelites “sat … to the face of Yahweh.” He means that they were in the presence of Yahweh near his sacred tent. The focus may also be on something being in front of or near a person or thing. When the author says in [3:27](../03/27.md) that Ehud was “to the face of” the Israelite soldiers who were with him, he means that Ehud was in front of them, that is, leading their army. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])\n\n### “into the hand of,” “into your hand”\n\nThe author and characters often use the word “hand” by association to represent the power and capability of a person. For example, the author says in [11:32](../11/32.md) that when Jephthah went to fight the Ammonites, “Yahweh gave them into his hand.” This means that Yahweh gave him the power to defeat them. The word “hand” may also represent possession, as when the author says in [7:8](../07/08.md) that Gideon’s soldiers “took provision into their hand.” The word “hand” may also represent agency, as when the author speaks in [3:4](../03/04.md) of the commandments that Yahweh gave the Israelites “by the hand of Moses.” In such cases, the author is using the hand, part of a person, to mean the whole person in the act of doing something. Notes will help distinguish the difference between these shades of meaning when that may not be clear from the context. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])\n\n### “hear,” “listen”\n\nThe author and characters often use the terms “hear” and “listen” to mean complying with what someone has said. When humans “hear” or “listen” in this sense, the terms mean “obey,” as when the author says negatively in [2:17](../02/17.md) that the disobedient Israelites did not “hear the commandments of Yahweh.” When Yahweh “hears” or “listens” in this sense, it means that he does what someone asks in prayer. For example, when the author says in [13:9](../13/09.md) that “God listened to the voice of Manoah,” he means that God answered Manoah’s prayer and sent the angel back to him and his wife. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])\n\n### name of tribe, city, or kingdom representing its people\n\nThe author and characters often use the name of a tribe, city, or kingdom to represent its people. For example, in [1:12](../01/12.md), when Caleb speaks of “whoever attacks Kiriath Sepher,” he is using the name of that city to refer by association to the people who live in it. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])\n\n### name of a person representing associated or accompanying people\n\nFor example, in [3:10](../03/10.md), when the author says of Othniel that “he went out to war,” he is using Othniel, one person who was involved in this action, to represent everyone who was involved. He means that the army of Israel went out to war with Othniel commanding it. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])\n\n### “nose burned against”\n\nIn several places in the book, the author uses the term “nose” and the expression “burned” to mean anger. For example, in [2:14](../02/14.md) he says that “the nose of Yahweh burned against Israel,” meaning that Yahweh became very angry with the Israelites. This is by association with the way that a person who is angry breathes heavily through his nose and the way the skin of a person who is angry becomes hotter. Your language and culture may also associate anger with a particular part and disposition of the body. If so, it may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. You could also use plain language and say “anger.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])\n\n### “shall”\n\nThe ULT represents the Hebrew instructional verb form with the English helping verb “shall.” For example, when Deborah tells Barak in [Judges 4:6](../04/06.md) “and you shall take with you 10,000 men,” she is instructing him to take 10,000 men with him. Other ways to say this are: “you are to take 10,000 men with you” or “take 10,000 men with you.” Translate this form with the most natural way in your language for giving instructions.\n\n### “sons of”\n\nThe author and characters often speak of “the sons of” a person to mean the nation or tribe that consists of his descendants. For example, the author speaks in [1:1](../01/01.md) of the “sons of Israel” to mean the Israelites and in [1:8](../01/08.md) of the “sons of Judah” to mean the people of the tribe of Judah and particularly their army. In this case, “sons” does not mean first-generation offspring but later descendants. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\nThe phrase “sons of” may also refer to people who have a particular characteristic or quality. For example, the author speaks in [18:2](../18/02.md) of “sons of valor,” meaning men who were characterized by valor, that is, valiant warriors. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])\n\n### “struck,” “struck to the mouth of the sword”\n\nIn many places, the author says that soldiers “struck” an opposing army, city, or king, as if they had only hit them. But he means that they attacked those opponents, and in some contexts the meaning is clearly that they killed them. That is the case in [3:29](../03/29.md), for example, where the author says, “And they struck Moab at that time, about 10,000 men … not one escaped.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])\n\nIn several contexts the author uses a longer form of this expression and says “they struck them (or it) to the mouth of the sword.” This means that they completely destroyed a city, killing everyone who lived there. For example, speaking in [1:25](../01/25.md) of what the tribes descended from Joseph did to Bethel, the author says that “they struck the city with the mouth of the sword.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])\n\n### “went up,” “went down”\n\nIn Hebrew, writers and speakers generally indicated whether people were going up to a higher elevation or going down to a lower elevation when they traveled. For example, in [1:3](../01/03.md) the soldiers of Judah ask the soldiers of Simeon to “go up” with them into their allotment because the Israelites were in the valley of the Jordan River and the Judeans’ allotment was in the hills above the valley. In [3:27](../03/27.md), the author says that the fighting men of Ephraim “went down” with Ehud because they were going from the hill country of Ephraim down into the Jordan River valley. If your language does not mark travel for change in elevation, you can translate instances such as these simply as “go” or “went.”
1:intro	a4am				0	# Judges 1 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n  - Verses 1–10: Judah conquers its assigned territory\n  - Verses 11–16: Caleb and Othniel conquer Debir (Kiriath Sepher)\n  - Verses 12–21: Judah and Simeon conquer territory but leave some hostile nations\n  - Verses 22–29: Ephraim and Manasseh conquer territory but leave some hostile nations\n  - Verses 30–36: Zebulun, Asher, Naphtali, and Dan conquer territory but leave some hostile nations\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Cutting off the thumbs and big toes of captured enemies\n\nIn [1:7](../01/07.md), Adoni-Bezek describes how he had his soldiers cut off the thumbs and big toes of the kings he had defeated. This prevented a captured enemy from running away or from ever using a weapon again. However, as the context shows, it was also a way of humiliating a captured king. When the Israelites did this to Adoni-Bezek, he acknowledged that he was getting what he deserved for having done this to others. \n\n### Complete destruction of a city and its people\n\nIn [1:17](../01/17.md), the armies of Judah and Simeon completely destroy a Canaanite city and kill all of its people. They call the place “Hormah,” which means “destruction.” [Deuteronomy 7:1–4](../../deu/07/01.md) describes how, when Yahweh was preparing the Israelites to enter the Promised Land, he commanded them to destroy completely the Canaanite people who lived there. They were not to make any treaties with them or to intermarry with them. This was to prevent the Israelites from joining them in worshiping their false gods, which would have led them to develop a culture and society very different from the kind that Yahweh wanted. The book of Joshua describes how the Israelites completely destroyed the major Canaanite cities and their people. In this chapter, [1:17](../01/17.md) describes a further instance of that. However, the Israelites left many of the Canaanite people in the land, and they did intermarry with them and worship their gods. This led the Israelites into many evil practices that made Yahweh very angry with them.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Names of people groups, cities, and Israelite tribes meaning their people or armies\n\nIn this chapter, the author and characters frequently use the names of people groups or cities by association to mean the people or armies of those groups or cities. For example, when the author says in [1:1](../01/01.md) that the Israelites “fought against Jerusalem,” he means that they fought against the people who lived in that city. The author and characters sometimes also speak of the Israelite tribes as if they were individual people who could talk to one another, go places together, and so forth. For example, the author says in [1:1](../01/01.md), “Then Judah said to Simeon, his brother, ‘Go up with me into my allotment.’” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. For example, instead of saying “Judah,” you could say “the people of the tribe of Judah.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])\n\n### Generic nouns\n\nIn this chapter, the author and characters use expressions such as “the Canaanite,” “the Perizzite,” “the Amorite,” and so forth. They are not referring to specific individuals. Rather, they mean in general the people of the nation mentioned. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using plural forms, for example, “the Canaanites.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun]])
1:1	j001		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֗י	1	The author is using the phrase **And it happened** to introduce a new event in the story of the people of Israel, which continues here in the book of Judges at the point where it left off at the end of the book of Joshua. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event.
1:1	j002		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בְּנֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל	1	See the discussion of the phrase **the sons of Israel** in the Introduction to Judges. Alternate translation: [the people of Israel]
1:1	j003		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	מִ֣י יַעֲלֶה	1	The Israelites are asking Yahweh which of their tribes should be the first to go into its allotment and fight against the Canaanites living there. They are speaking of that tribe as if it were an individual person. (The verb in this phrase is singular, indicating that **Who** is also singular.) See the discussion of this issue, which occurs several times in this chapter, in the Introduction to this chapter. Alternate translation: [What tribe will go up]
1:1	c92j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	לָּ֧⁠נוּ	1	By **us**, the Israelites mean themselves but not Yahweh, to whom they are speaking, so use the exclusive form of that word in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
1:1	j231		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	הַֽ⁠כְּנַעֲנִ֛י & בּֽ⁠וֹ	1	As the Introduction to this chapter discusses, here and in similar instances throughout the chapter, this is not a reference to a specific **Canaanite**. Rather, it refers to the Canaanites or the Canaanite nations in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using plural forms. Alternate translation: [the Canaanites … against them] or [the Canaanite nations … against them]
1:2	c4zw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	יְהוּדָ֣ה	1	As the Introduction to Judges and the Introduction to this chapter discuss, here Yahweh is using the name **Judah** by association to mean the army that belongs to the tribe of Judah. Alternate translation: [The army of the tribe of Judah]
1:2	j004		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הִנֵּ֛ה	1	Yahweh is using the term **Behold**, which literally means “Look,” to focus his listeners’ attention on what he is about to say. See the discussion of this usage in the Introduction to Judges. In this context, since Yahweh is the speaker, there is also the implication that what follows is something that Yahweh has determined and so is certain to happen. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: [Indeed]
1:2	j005		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	נָתַ֥תִּי אֶת־הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ בְּ⁠יָדֽ⁠וֹ	1	Here, as the Introduction to Judges discusses, having something in one’s **hand** represents possessing it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [I have given them possession of the land]
1:3	j006		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר יְהוּדָה֩ לְ⁠שִׁמְע֨וֹן & וַ⁠יֵּ֥לֶךְ אִתּ֖⁠וֹ שִׁמְעֽוֹן	1	As the Introduction to this chapter discusses, here the author is speaking of the tribes of Judah and Simeon as if they were individual people who could speak with each other. Alternate translation: [Then the people of Judah said to the people of Simeon … So the people of Simeon went with them] or [Then the commanders of the Judean army said to the commanders of the Simeonite army … So the Simeonite army went with the Judean army]
1:3	k7aq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אָחִ֜י⁠ו	1	The author is using the term **brother** to describe people who are descended from the same ancestor. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [their kinsmen]
1:3	j007		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	עֲלֵ֧ה אִתִּ֣⁠י	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “Come” instead of **Go**. Alternate translation: [Come with me]
1:3	j008		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	בַּֽ⁠כְּנַעֲנִ֔י	1	See how you translated this same expression in [1:1](../01/01.md). Alternate translation: [against the Canaanites]
1:3	j009		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠הָלַכְתִּ֧י גַם־אֲנִ֛י אִתְּ⁠ךָ֖ בְּ⁠גוֹרָלֶ֑⁠ךָ	1	The Judeans are leaving some information implicit. You could state this information explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [If you do, we will also go with you into your allotment and fight against the Canaanites]
1:4	ku4h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וַ⁠יַּ֣עַל יְהוּדָ֔ה	1	As the Introduction to this chapter discusses, here the author is using the name of one of the tribes whose soldiers were in this army to mean the entire army, which included soldiers from both tribes. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [And the army of the tribe of Judah went up with the army of the tribe of Simeon]
1:4	j010		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יִּתֵּ֧ן יְהוָ֛ה אֶת־הַ⁠כְּנַעֲנִ֥י וְ⁠הַ⁠פְּרִזִּ֖י בְּ⁠יָדָ֑⁠ם	1	Here, as the Introduction to Judges discusses, **hand** represents the power or capability of a person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [and Yahweh gave them the power to conquer the Canaanites and the Perizzites]
1:4	j011		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יַּכּ֣וּ⁠ם בְּ⁠בֶ֔זֶק	1	As the Introduction to Judges discusses, when the author says that the armies of Judah and Simeon **struck** or “hit” the Canaanite and Perizzite soldiers who opposed them, he means that they defeated them and, in contexts such as this, that they killed them. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: [And at Bezek they defeated] or [And at Bezek they killed]
1:4	c9xq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	בְּ⁠בֶ֔זֶק	1	**Bezek** is the name of a city in the territory in Canaan that was allotted to the tribe of Judah.
1:4	n19d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers	עֲשֶׂ֥רֶת אֲלָפִ֖ים	1	The author may be using the number **10,000** as an approximation or as a customary way of saying “very many.” Alternate translation: [a large number of]
1:5	j012		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַֽ֠⁠יִּמְצְאוּ	1	The word **found** does not mean that the armies of Judah and Simeon were intentionally searching for this man. It means that they encountered him when they reached the city of Bezek. Alternate translation: [and they encountered]
1:5	w88l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	אֶת־אֲדֹנִ֥י בֶ֨זֶק֙	1	The word **Adoni-Bezek** is the name or title of a man. It means “the lord of Bezek,” and so it may be the title for the king who reigned in the city of Bezek.
1:5	i3pn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וַ⁠יִּֽלָּחֲמ֖וּ בּ֑⁠וֹ	1	As the Introduction to this chapter discusses, here the author is using Adoni-Bezek to represent both this king himself and his entire army. Alternate translation: [and they fought against him and his army]
1:6	j014		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	אֶת־בְּהֹנ֥וֹת יָדָ֖י⁠ו וְ⁠רַגְלָֽי⁠ו	1	Some languages use the same word for the largest finger and the largest toe, as the biblical text does here. If your language has different words for these, you can use both words in your translation. If the phrase might then seem to contain extra information that would be unnatural to express in your language, you could shorten it, as the UST does. Alternate translation: [the thumbs of his hands and the big toes of his feet]
1:7	es2p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers	שִׁבְעִ֣ים ׀ מְלָכִ֡ים	1	This could be an approximate number, chosen for its symbolic significance. Alternate translation: [dozens of kings]
1:7	j015		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	מְלָכִ֡ים	1	In Canaan at this time, each city and town had a ruler who had the same title as someone who ruled over a large territory. So, for example, Pharaoh is called the “the king of Egypt” in [Exodus 1:5](../../exo/01/05.md), while the book of Joshua refers to the “king” of cities such as Libnah ([Joshua 10:30](../../jos/10/30.md)) and Hebron ([Joshua 10:37](../../jos/10/37.md)). If your language uses a different word for people who rule over one community than for people who rule over extensive areas, you could use that term here. Alternate translation: [chieftains]
1:7	t5fd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	בְּֽהֹנוֹת֩ יְדֵי⁠הֶ֨ם וְ⁠רַגְלֵי⁠הֶ֜ם מְקֻצָּצִ֗ים	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. See the Introduction to this chapter for an explanation of the practice described here. It is unlikely that Adoni-Bezek was the agent who did this personally. Alternate translation: [whose thumbs and big toes I ordered my soldiers to cut off]
1:7	g0oe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	הָי֤וּ מְלַקְּטִים֙ תַּ֣חַת שֻׁלְחָנִ֔⁠י	1	Adoni-Bezek is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: [were gathering scraps of food beneath my table]
1:7	p5cw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הָי֤וּ מְלַקְּטִים֙ תַּ֣חַת שֻׁלְחָנִ֔⁠י	1	Dozens of **kings** would not have fit under the **table** where Adoni-Bezek ate his meals, so he probably does not mean this literally. Instead, he seems to be speaking of these defeated chieftains as if they were dogs that had to scrounge for food from the scraps that fell from his table. This indicates that he had reduced them to a state of helpless dependence. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [had to survive on what little I gave them] or [were my helpless prisoners]
1:8	j016		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בְנֵֽי־יְהוּדָה֙	1	Here, **sons** means “descendants.” The author is describing the people of the tribe of Judah as descendants of their ancestor Judah. In context, the reference is specifically to the army of the tribe of Judah. Alternate translation: [the Judeans] or [the Judean army]
1:8	j017		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	בְנֵֽי־יְהוּדָה֙	1	As in [1:4](../01/04.md), the author is using the name **Judah** to represent the entire combined army. Alternate translation: [the armies of the tribes of Judah and Simeon]
1:8	hh58		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בִּ⁠יר֣וּשָׁלִַ֔ם וַ⁠יִּלְכְּד֣וּ אוֹתָ֔⁠הּ	1	As the Introduction to this chapter discusses, here the author is using the name **Jerusalem** to represent the people of that city. Alternate translation: [against the people who lived in Jerusalem and captured that city]
1:8	j019		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יַּכּ֖וּ⁠הָ לְ⁠פִי־חָ֑רֶב	1	As the Introduction to Judges discusses, the author is using the expression **to the mouth of the sword** to mean that the army of the tribe of Judah killed all the inhabitants of Jerusalem. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. The UST models one way to do that.
1:8	j018		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יַּכּ֖וּ⁠הָ	1	The author is speaking of the people who lived in the city of Jerusalem by association with the city itself, which he refers to by the pronoun **it**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or express the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [And they struck the people who lived there]
1:8	j021		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠אֶת־הָ⁠עִ֖יר שִׁלְּח֥וּ בָ⁠אֵֽשׁ	1	The author is speaking as if the Israelites had literally **sent** or thrown the **city** of Jerusalem into a large **fire** that was burning nearby. (This same expression occurs in [Judges 20:48](../20/48.md).) If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [and they set the city on fire]

1:9	x4ew		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	וְ⁠הַ⁠שְּׁפֵלָֽה	1	The word **Shephelah** is the name of a region within the territory that was assigned to the tribe of Judah. It consists of hills that are lower than the central ridge where Jerusalem is located. Alternate translation: [and the foothills]

1:10	ax37		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וְ⁠שֵׁם־חֶבְר֥וֹן לְ⁠פָנִ֖ים קִרְיַ֣ת אַרְבַּ֑ע	1	Here the author is providing background information to help readers understand what is happening in the story. The author probably wrote this because his readers knew this city as **Hebron**. But at the time when Israel attacked it, it was called **Kiriath Arba**. In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture. You may also wish to mark it in some way as background information, such as by putting it in parentheses as the ULT does. Alternate translation: [Hebron used to be called Kiriath Arba]

1:11	j024		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֵּ֣לֶךְ	1	The pronoun **he** refers to “Judah” in the previous verse. That name represented the army of the tribe of Judah and implicitly the accompanying army of the tribe of Simeon. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: [And these armies went]
1:11	j025		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	דְּבִ֑יר	1	The word **Debir** is the name of a city in the territory that Joshua assigned to the tribe of Judah.

1:12	j026		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר כָּלֵ֔ב	1	The author assumes that readers will know that a man named **Caleb** was commanding the armies of Judah and Simeon at this point. (The full story is told in [Joshua 15:13–19](../../jos/15/13.md).) You could indicate this explicitly if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [And Caleb, the man who was commanding these armies, said]
1:14	j027		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וַ⁠יְהִ֣י	1	The author is using this phrase to introduce background information that is not part of the main narrative. In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
1:14	j028		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בְּ⁠בוֹאָ֗⁠הּ	1	The author assumes that his readers will understand what he means by this phrase. This could mean: (1) that Aksah came to Kiriath Sepher in order to marry Othniel and that she made this **request** when she arrived and saw the land that Caleb had given to him. Alternate translation: [when Aksah arrived at Kiriath Sepher]; (2) that the author is using this expression to describe Aksah entering Othniel’s household as his wife. Alternate translation: [once Aksah had married Othniel]
1:14	u3cc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠תְּסִיתֵ֨⁠הוּ֙ לִ⁠שְׁא֤וֹל & הַ⁠שָּׂדֶ֔ה	1	The author is leaving implicit who was to make this request. The meaning does not seem to be that Aksah persuaded Othniel that he should **request** this **field** from Caleb, since he is not the one who asks; she is. In this culture, a young man such as Othniel may not have had the standing to make this kind of request from a leader such as Caleb. So the meaning seems to be that Aksah persuaded Othniel that she should ask for the field. In this culture, a daughter may have been able to make such a request of her father. Alternate translation: [that she persuaded him to allow her to request the field]
1:14	j029		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מֵֽ⁠אֵת־אָבִ֨י⁠הָ֙ הַ⁠שָּׂדֶ֔ה	1	The author has a particular **field** in view. The narrative suggests that Caleb had given some land to Othniel but that it was arid territory. It suggests further that near this land, there was some ground that was suitable for cultivation because it was watered by springs. You could state this information explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [from her father some land that was nearby the land that he had already given to Othniel and that was watered by springs and so could be cultivated]
1:14	j030		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	מַה־לָּֽ⁠ךְ	1	Caleb is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: [What can to do for you]
1:15	j031		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	הָֽבָ⁠ה	1	This is an imperative, but it communicates a polite request rather than a command. Use a form in your language that communicates a polite request. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: [Please give]
1:15	j032		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	בְרָכָ֗ה	1	In this context, the word **blessing** is an abstract noun. It does not refer to something that someone would say to cause good and beneficial things to happen to a person. Instead, it refers to a good and beneficial thing itself. If your language does not use abstract nouns in this way, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [something that will benefit me]
1:15	j033		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	וְ⁠נָתַתָּ֥ה לִ֖⁠י	1	Aksah is using a verb form that could either indicate what a person ought to do or what a person is going to do. This could mean: (1) that since the land Caleb gave Aksah and Othniel was dry, he also ought to give them some land with springs of water. Alternate translation: [you should also give me]; (2) that Aksah is answering Caleb’s question and this is implicitly her request. Alternate translation: [my request is that you will also give me]
1:15	j034		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	גֻּלֹּ֣ת מָ֑יִם & אֵ֚ת גֻּלֹּ֣ת עִלִּ֔ית וְ⁠אֵ֖ת גֻּלֹּ֥ת תַּחְתִּֽית	1	Aksah and the author are using these expressions to mean by association the land on which these **springs** were located. Alternate translation: [some land that has springs of waters … some land in that area where there were upper springs and lower springs]
1:15	j035		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	גֻּלֹּ֣ת מָ֑יִם	1	It might seem that this expression contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in your language. If so, you can shorten it. Alternate translation: [springs] or [land on which there are springs]
1:16	j036		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וּ⁠בְנֵ֣י קֵינִי֩	1	The author is introducing some further background information that is not part of the main narrative. In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
1:16	j037		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ⁠בְנֵ֣י	1	Since the actual sons of the man whom the author is describing here would have been in the same generation as Moses, the term **sons** could be intended literally. However, since those sons would have had three or even four generations of descendants by this time, the term may also be meant to include them. Alternate translation: [Now the descendants of]
1:16	fqe9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	קֵינִי֩	1	The word **Kenite** is the name of a people group. Since the author has a specific **Kenite** in mind, your language might use a demonstrative pronoun here. Alternate translation: [that Kenite] or [that man from the Kenite people group]
1:16	x6ei		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	חֹתֵ֨ן מֹשֶׁ֜ה	1	Your language may have its own term or expression for this relationship. Alternate translation: [the father of Moses’ wife]
1:16	a29w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	מֵ⁠עִ֤יר הַ⁠תְּמָרִים֙	1	The author is using the expression **the City of Palms** to refer to settlements in the area of the city of Jericho, which the Israelites had destroyed several years before this. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use the name “Jericho” here. Alternate translation: [from Jericho] or [from Jericho, the city of palm trees]
1:16	j038		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֶת־בְּנֵ֣י יְהוּדָ֔ה	1	Here, the term **sons** means “descendants.” The author is identifying the Judeans as descendants of their ancestor Judah. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. See how you translated the similar expression “the sons of Israel” in [1:1](../01/01.md). Alternate translation: [with the people of Judah]
1:16	j039		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֵּ֖לֶךְ וַ⁠יֵּ֥שֶׁב	1	The pronoun **he** seems to refer to **the Kenite**, that is, the man who was the father-in-law of Moses. The author is using him to represent his descendants. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: [And they went and they dwelled]
1:16	j040		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֶת־הָ⁠עָֽם	1	By **the people** the author means those from the tribe of Judah who also settled in this region. You could state this information explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [among the people of Judah who also settled there]
1:17	e48a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וַ⁠יֵּ֤לֶךְ יְהוּדָה֙ אֶת־שִׁמְע֣וֹן אָחִ֔י⁠ו	1	See how you translated the terms **Judah**, **Simeon**, and **brother** in [1:3](../01/03.md).

1:17	vjhr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יַּחֲרִ֣ימוּ אוֹתָ֔⁠הּ	1	The word that the ULT translates as **devoted** is a specialized term that describes the cultural practice of giving something over to Yahweh so that humans will no longer be able to use it. Depending on the context, the term can indicate either “destroy” or “preserve, but set apart.” In this context, the meaning is clearly “destroy.” You could indicate that in your translation if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [And they completely destroyed it]
1:17	j041		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֥א אֶת־שֵׁם־הָ⁠עִ֖יר	1	It might seem that the expression **called the name** contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in your language. If so, you can shorten it. Alternate translation: [and they called the city] or [and they named the city]
1:17	iy2d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	חָרְמָֽה	1	The word **Hormah** is the name of a city. The Israelites changed the name of Zephath to Hormah, which means “destruction,” after they destroyed it completely. See the Introduction to this chapter for a further discussion.
1:18	j042		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	יְהוּדָה֙	1	The author is using the name of one of the tribes whose soldiers were in this army to mean the entire army. Alternate translation: [the combined army of Judah and Simeon]
1:19	j044		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וַ⁠יְהִ֤י	1	The author is using this expression to introduce information about what was happening behind the scenes in this story and also to introduce an overall theme for [1:19–36](../01/19.md). In a way that was not visible, Yahweh was helping the Israelites to defeat the Canaanites. Nevertheless, the Israelite tribes did not drive the Canaanite nations completely out of their assigned territories. In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
1:19	vtq2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יְהוָה֙ אֶתּ־יְהוּדָ֔ה	1	The author is speaking as if Yahweh had literally been present **with** the army of Judah as it fought to conquer its assigned territory. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [Yahweh helped Judah]
1:19	j046		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	רֶ֥כֶב בַּרְזֶ֖ל	1	The metal **iron** was barely used during this time period, so this is not a reference to chariots entirely made of **iron**. Those would have been too heavy for any practical use in warfare anyway. It is probably a reference to chariots whose wheels or floor were strengthened with iron or that had iron studs or points to make them more destructive when used in ramming. Alternate translation: [chariots fitted out with iron]
1:20	ys79		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יִּתְּנ֤וּ	1	The pronoun **they** refers to the people of the tribe of Judah and most likely to their leaders. While Moses had originally promised **Hebron** to **Caleb** in [Numbers 14:24](../../num/14/24.md) and Joshua had confirmed this in [Joshua 14:6–15](../../jos/14/06.md), the leaders of Judah confirmed this again when they conquered their assigned territory. Alternate translation: [But the leaders of the tribe of Judah gave]
1:20	eml1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֶת־שְׁלֹשָׁ֖ה בְּנֵ֥י הָ⁠עֲנָֽק	1	The author is speaking of the three clans that lived in and around the city of Hebron as if they were the literal **sons** of their ancestor Anak. (These clans are named in [1:10](../01/10.md).) If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [the three clans descended from Anak]
1:20	tyj7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	הָ⁠עֲנָֽק	1	The word **Anak** is the name of a man. The author seems to be using the definite article **the** to indicate that he has a specific **Anak** in mind, the man who was the ancestor of these clans. Your language might naturally use a demonstrative pronoun for this purpose. Alternate translation: [the well-known Anak]
1:21	j047		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	וְ⁠אֶת־הַ⁠יְבוּסִי֙ יֹשֵׁ֣ב יְרֽוּשָׁלִַ֔ם & וַ⁠יֵּ֨שֶׁב הַ⁠יְבוּסִ֜י	1	[1:251](../01/251.md):25The word **Jebusite** is the name of a member of a particular people group.

1:21	j048		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בְּנֵ֣י בִנְיָמִ֑ן & אֶת־בְּנֵ֤י בִנְיָמִן֙	1	Here, **sons** means “descendants.” The author is describing the people of the tribe of Benjamin as descendants of their ancestor Benjamin. The reference in the first instance is specifically to the army of this tribe; it seems to be generally to the people of the tribe in the second instance. Alternate translation: [the army of the tribe of Benjamin … with the people of the tribe of Benjamin]
1:21	l6aj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	עַ֖ד הַ⁠יּ֥וֹם הַ⁠זֶּֽה	1	The author is using the term **day** to refer to a specific time, the time when he was writing this book.

1:22	da33		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בֵית־יוֹסֵ֛ף	1	Here the term **house** means all the people descended from a particular person. It envisions them as if they were one household living together. So **the house of Joseph** means all the people descended from the patriarch Joseph. By this time, those descendants had become the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh. Alternate translation: [the descendants of Joseph] or [the armies of the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh]

1:23	vx3f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וְ⁠שֵׁם־הָ⁠עִ֥יר לְ⁠פָנִ֖ים לֽוּז	1	Here the author is providing background information to help readers understand what is happening in the story. The author probably wrote this because his readers knew this city as **Bethel**. But at the time when Israel attacked it, it was called **Luz**. In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture. You may also wish to mark it in some way as background information, such as by putting it in parentheses as the ULT does. Alternate translation: [Bethel used to be called Luz]
1:24	j052		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וְ⁠עָשִׂ֥ינוּ עִמְּ⁠ךָ֖ חָֽסֶד	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **kindness**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [we will treat you kindly] or [we will treat you mercifully]
1:25	dj1j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יַּכּ֥וּ אֶת־הָ⁠עִ֖יר לְ⁠פִי־חָ֑רֶב	1	The author is saying **the city** by association to mean the people who lived in the city. Alternate translation: [and they struck the people of the city with the mouth of the sword]

Alternate translation: [And the Amorites did not allow the sons of Dan to go down into the valley, so they were pressed into the hill country]

1:36	j061		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וּ⁠גְבוּל֙ הָ⁠אֱמֹרִ֔י	1	The author is introducing background information that is not part of the main story. In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
1:36	g7nx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate	מִֽ⁠מַּעֲלֵ֖ה עַקְרַבִּ֑ים	1	**Akrabbim** is a Hebrew word that the ULT has spelled out using English letters so that readers will know how it sounds. The word means “scorpions” in Hebrew, and here it is the name of a place. In your translation you could spell this name the way it sounds in your language, or you could express its meaning as a name. Alternate translation: [was from Scorpion Pass]
1:36	qr2w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	מֵ⁠הַ⁠סֶּ֖לַע	1	The word **Sela** also means “cliff,” so this could be a geographic description rather than a proper name. Alternate translation: [from the cliff]
2:intro	mf6a				0	# Judges 2 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n  - Verses 1–5: The angel of Yahweh appears to the Israelites at Bochim\n  - Verses 6–10: Review: the Israelites worshiped and obeyed Yahweh during the lifetimes of Joshua and the elders\n  - Verses 11–23: The Israelites disobeyed Yahweh and worshiped other gods afterward, so Yahweh let other nations conquer them\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Joshua reappears in the story after it tells how he died\n\nIn [Judges 2:6–9](../02/06.md), the author repeats [Joshua 24:28–31](../../jos/24/28.md) to remind readers how the people of Israel served Yahweh faithfully when they first arrived in the land of Canaan. This is background information. After these verses, the main story of the book of Judges begins. It is about how the Israelites then worshiped other gods, but Yahweh repeatedly brought them back to himself and delivered them from their enemies when they repented. It may seem strange for the book to speak of Joshua doing something, since it begins “after the death of Joshua.” So you can translate this in a way that shows that the author is providing background information by describing something that happened in the past. See the note at [2:6](../02/06.md) for a specific suggestion.\n\n### “Cut a covenant”\n\nThe phrase “cut a covenant” occurs in this chapter. It means “make a covenant.” The word “cut” reflects the cultural background. It is used because in some covenant ceremonies, the participants would cut up animals and then walk between the pieces. This was to indicate, “If I break this covenant, may I be destroyed in this same way.” It is not necessary to understand this background to covenant ceremonies in order to understand the action in this chapter, so you do not have to use the term “cut” in your translation. You could simply say “make,” or you could use an expression from your own language and culture.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### “fathers”\n\nIn this chapter, the author uses the word “fathers” several times to mean “ancestors.” He is not speaking of the immediate male parents of the Israelites, but of the generations who lived before them. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Symbolic action\n\nIn this chapter, the author speaks of the Israelites bowing down to idols that represented foreign gods. This was a symbolic action that constituted a public act of worship, so it represented a definitive expression of allegiance to those gods. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. When the book says that the Israelites bowed down to foreign gods, you could say, for example, that they “worshiped them by bowing down to them.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction]])
2:1	tt9y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מַלְאַךְ־יְהוָ֛ה	1	See the discussion of the phrase **the angel of Yahweh** in the Introduction to Judges.
2:1	x66i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	הַ⁠בֹּכִ֑ים	1	The word **Bochim** is the name of a place. The Israelites actually give the place this name at the end of this episode, in [2:5](../02/05.md), but the author is using it here because his readers knew the place by that name. See the UST for one way to handle this issue.
2:1	te37		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֹּאמֶר֩	1	The author is leaving some information implicit that he assumes readers will understand.

2:1	im2i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	אַעֲלֶ֨ה אֶתְ⁠כֶ֜ם	1	The angel, speaking on behalf of Yahweh, is using the present tense to describe a past event. He may be doing that because delivering the Israelites from slavery in Egypt and settling them in the land of Canaan together constitute a single work on their behalf that was still ongoing at this point. However, if it would not be natural for a speaker of your language to use the present tense in such a context, you could use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: [I brought you up from Egypt]
2:1	ha9u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לַ⁠אֲבֹ֣תֵי⁠כֶ֔ם	1	As the Introduction to this chapter discusses, the angel is using the term **fathers** to mean “ancestors.” If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [to your ancestors]

2:2	j063		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	וְ⁠אַתֶּ֗ם לֹֽא־תִכְרְת֤וּ בְרִית֙ לְ⁠יֽוֹשְׁבֵי֙ הָ⁠אָ֣רֶץ הַ⁠זֹּ֔את מִזְבְּחוֹתֵי⁠הֶ֖ם תִּתֹּצ֑וּ⁠ן	1	If you decided in the previous verse to translate this quotation in such a way that there would not be a quotation within a quotation, you can continue doing that here. Alternate translation: [But I also said that you were not to cut a covenant with the dwellers of this land. You were to demolish their altars]
2:2	gob6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠לֹֽא־שְׁמַעְתֶּ֥ם בְּ⁠קֹלִ֖⁠י	1	As the Introduction to Judges discusses, here the word **heard** has the specific sense of “obeyed.” Alternate translation: [But you have not obeyed my voice]
2:2	syq4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠לֹֽא־שְׁמַעְתֶּ֥ם בְּ⁠קֹלִ֖⁠י	1	The angel, speaking on behalf of Yahweh, is using the word **voice** by association to mean what he said by using his voice. Alternate translation: [But you have disobeyed what I commanded]
2:2	w8ys		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מַה־זֹּ֥את עֲשִׂיתֶֽם	1	The angel is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [You should not have done this!]
2:3	kdq3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	וְ⁠גַ֣ם אָמַ֔רְתִּי לֹֽא־אֲגָרֵ֥שׁ אוֹתָ֖⁠ם מִ⁠פְּנֵי⁠כֶ֑ם וְ⁠הָי֤וּ לָ⁠כֶם֙ לְ⁠צִדִּ֔ים וֵ⁠אלֹ֣הֵי⁠הֶ֔ם יִהְי֥וּ לָ⁠כֶ֖ם לְ⁠מוֹקֵֽשׁ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: [And I have also said that I would not expel them from before you, but they would be to you like thorns in your sides, and their gods would be a snare to you]
2:3	j064		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠גַ֣ם אָמַ֔רְתִּי	1	The angel, representing Yahweh, assumes that the Israelites will know when he **also said** this. In [Numbers 33:55](../../num/33/55.md), Yahweh told the Israelites that if they did not drive out the Canaanites, the ones who remained would be thorns in their sides. In [Joshua 23:12–13](../../jos/23/12.md), Joshua warned the Israelites that if they made treaties with the Canaanite nations and intermarried with them, then Yahweh would no longer dispossess those nations and they would be thorns and a snare to the Israelites. So the angel seems to be indicating that Joshua was speaking on behalf of Yahweh when Joshua said that Yahweh would no longer drive out the Canaanites. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [And as I said through Joshua]
2:3	rg0e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מִ⁠פְּנֵי⁠כֶ֑ם	1	Here, **from the face of** is a common expression of the culture that means “because of” or “on account of.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [on your behalf] or [because of you]
2:3	j065		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠הָי֤וּ לָ⁠כֶם֙ לְ⁠צִדִּ֔ים	1	The angel is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: [but they will be thorns in your sides]
2:3	plg4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠הָי֤וּ לָ⁠כֶם֙ לְ⁠צִדִּ֔ים	1	Yahweh spoke as if the Canaanites would literally be thorns in the **sides** of the Israelites. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [but they will continually cause trouble for you]
2:3	b6w1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וֵ⁠אלֹ֣הֵי⁠הֶ֔ם יִהְי֥וּ לָ⁠כֶ֖ם לְ⁠מוֹקֵֽשׁ	1	Yahweh spoke as if the **gods** of the Canaanites would literally be a **snare** in which the Israelites would be caught. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [and worshiping their gods will be the cause of your destruction]
2:4	j066		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וַ⁠יְהִ֗י	1	The author is using this phrase to introduce background information that is not part of the main narrative. This verse and the next verse explain how this place got the name Bochim. In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
2:4	us1x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בְּנֵ֖י יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל	1	See the discussion of this phrase in the Introduction to Judges. Alternate translation: [the Israelites]

Alternate translation: [that the people lifted up their voices and wept]
2:4	j068		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יִּשְׂא֥וּ הָ⁠עָ֛ם אֶת־קוֹלָ֖⁠ם וַ⁠יִּבְכּֽוּ	1	The author is speaking as if a **voice** were literally something that the people of Israel could have **lifted up**. He means that they spoke loudly. Your language may have an expression of its own that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: [that the people wept in loud voices]
2:4	f5v2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	וַ⁠יִּשְׂא֥וּ הָ⁠עָ֛ם אֶת־קוֹלָ֖⁠ם וַ⁠יִּבְכּֽוּ	1	The phrase **lifted up their voice and wept** conveys a single idea by using two expressions connected with **and**. The expression **lifted up their voice** tells in what way the people **wept.** Alternate translation: [that the people wept out loud]
2:5	j069		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַֽ⁠יִּקְרְא֛וּ שֵֽׁם־הַ⁠מָּק֥וֹם הַ⁠ה֖וּא בֹּכִ֑ים	1	The author assumes that his readers will know that **Bochim** means “weepers.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could provide this information in a footnote, or you could put it in the text of your translation, as the UST does.
2:5	j070		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	וַֽ⁠יִּקְרְא֛וּ שֵֽׁם־הַ⁠מָּק֥וֹם הַ⁠ה֖וּא	1	It might seem that the expression **they called the name of that place** contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in your language. If so, you can shorten it. See how you translated the same expression in [1:17](../01/17.md). Alternate translation: [So they called that place]
2:6	u1xb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וַ⁠יְשַׁלַּ֥ח יְהוֹשֻׁ֖עַ אֶת־הָ⁠עָ֑ם וַ⁠יֵּלְכ֧וּ בְנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֛ל	1	Here the author is providing background information to help readers understand what happens next in the story. See the discussion of this in the Introduction to this chapter. Alternate translation: [Now after Joshua had dismissed the people, the sons of Israel had gone]
2:6	i12e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אִ֥ישׁ לְ⁠נַחֲלָת֖⁠וֹ	1	The author is speaking as if the land that Joshua assigned to the tribes were literally an **inheritance** that they received from a relative who had died. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [each one to his assigned territory]
2:7	kcc2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וַ⁠יַּעַבְד֤וּ הָ⁠עָם֙ אֶת־יְהוָ֔ה	1	If you decided to translate [2:6](../02/06.md) in a way that showed it was background information, you can continue to do that in this verse. Alternate translation: [And the people had served Yahweh]
2:7	ydz9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	כֹּ֖ל יְמֵ֣י יְהוֹשֻׁ֑עַ וְ⁠כֹ֣ל ׀ יְמֵ֣י הַ⁠זְּקֵנִ֗ים	1	In these phrases, the author is using the term **days** to refer to a specific time, the lifetimes of Joshua and these elders. He is doing this by association with the way a lifetime is made up of individual days. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [throughout the lifetimes of Joshua and the elders]
2:7	qml9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אֲשֶׁ֨ר הֶאֱרִ֤יכוּ יָמִים֙ אַחֲרֵ֣י יְהוֹשׁ֔וּעַ	1	The author is speaking as if these **elders** had done something to make their days longer after Joshua died. He is using a common expression that means that their **days**, that is, their lifetimes, continued for some years after Joshua died. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [who had outlived Joshua]
2:7	vx72		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	אֵ֣ת כָּל־מַעֲשֵׂ֤ה & הַ⁠גָּד֔וֹל	1	In a context such as this, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **deed**. Alternate translation: [all of the great deeds]
2:8	ii19		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וַ⁠יָּ֛מָת יְהוֹשֻׁ֥עַ בִּן־נ֖וּן עֶ֣בֶד יְהוָ֑ה	1	If you have been translating these verses in a way that shows they are background information, you can continue to do that here. Alternate translation: [Now Joshua, the son of Nun, the servant of Yahweh, had died]
2:8	k12w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	נ֖וּן	1	The word **Nun** is the name of a man, the father of **Joshua**.
2:8	xfn6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בֶּן־מֵאָ֥ה וָ⁠עֶ֖שֶׂר שָׁנִֽים	1	In certain contexts, the expression **son of** indicates that a person shares the qualities of something. In cases such as this, it specifically describes how old a person is. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [when he was 110 years old]
2:9	j233		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וַ⁠יִּקְבְּר֤וּ אוֹת⁠וֹ֙	1	If you have been translating these verses in a way that shows they are background information, you can continue to do that here. Alternate translation: [And they had buried him]
2:9	j071		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יִּקְבְּר֤וּ אוֹת⁠וֹ֙	1	Here the author is not using **they** to refer to specific people. Use an expression for this that would be natural in your language. Alternate translation: [And his people buried him] or [And he was buried]
2:9	yk2s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	בְּ⁠תִמְנַת־חֶ֖רֶס & גָּֽעַשׁ	1	The words **Timnath Heres** are the name of an area.
2:10	j072		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠גַם֙ כָּל־הַ⁠דּ֣וֹר הַ⁠ה֔וּא נֶאֶסְפ֖וּ אֶל־אֲבוֹתָ֑י⁠ו	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, the context suggests that it was Yahweh. Alternate translation: [And Yahweh also gathered all of that generation to its fathers]
2:10	umh1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	וְ⁠גַם֙ & נֶאֶסְפ֖וּ אֶל־אֲבוֹתָ֑י⁠ו	1	The author is using **gathered to its fathers** to mean that the people of that generation died. This is a mild way of referring to death. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: [And … also passed away]
2:10	j073		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	אֲשֶׁ֤ר לֹא־יָֽדְעוּ֙ אֶת־יְהוָ֔ה וְ⁠גַם֙ אֶת־הַֽ⁠מַּעֲשֶׂ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר עָשָׂ֖ה לְ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	The author is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: [who did not know Yahweh and also did not know the deed that he had done for Israel]
2:10	j074		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	אֶת־הַֽ⁠מַּעֲשֶׂ֔ה	1	Since the author is referring to all of the things that **Yahweh … had done for Israel**, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **deed** as in [2:7](../02/07.md). Alternate translation: [the deeds]
2:11	j075		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	אֶת־הָ⁠רַ֖ע	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **evil**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [what was evil] or [things that were evil]
2:11	yhh4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בְּ⁠עֵינֵ֣י יְהוָ֑ה	1	The author is using the common expression of his culture, **in the eyes of**, to mean “in the judgment of” or “in the opinion of.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [in Yahweh’s judgment]
2:11	gx61		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	אֶת־הַ⁠בְּעָלִֽים	1	The word **Baals** is the plural of the name Baal. While Baal was generally the name of one particular false god, the word was also used for various other gods that were often worshiped along with Baal. If using the plural name in your translation would not be clear for your readers, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [many false gods]

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: [and they worshiped them by bowing down to them]
2:13	ddu6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	וְ⁠לָ⁠עַשְׁתָּרֽוֹת	1	The word **Ashtoreths** is the plural of the name Ashtoreth.

2:14	j076		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּֽחַר־אַ֤ף יְהוָה֙ בְּ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל	1	As the Introduction to Judges discusses, the author is using the term **nose** to mean anger, by association with the way that a person who is angry breathes heavily through his nose. Your language and culture may also associate anger with a particular part of the body. If so, you could use an expression involving that part of the body in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: [Then Yahweh became very angry with Israel]
2:14	r6xm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יִּֽחַר־אַ֤ף יְהוָה֙ בְּ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל	1	The author is speaking as if Yahweh’s anger literally **burned**, as if it were a fire.

2:14	hy05		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַֽ⁠יִּמְכְּרֵ֞⁠ם בְּ⁠יַ֤ד אֽוֹיְבֵי⁠הֶם֙	1	Here, **hand** represents possession, by association with the way that people may hold something that they own in their hands. It was as if the hostile nations owned the Israelites as their slaves. Alternate translation: [And he made them subject to their enemies]
2:14	j077		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠לֹֽא־יָכְל֣וּ ע֔וֹד לַ⁠עֲמֹ֖ד לִ⁠פְנֵ֥י אוֹיְבֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	The author is speaking as if the Israelites could literally not **stand** up in the presence of their **enemies**. As the Introduction to Judges discusses, here **face** represents their presence, by association with the way people can see the face of someone who is present. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [and they were no longer able to resist their enemies]
2:15	j078		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	כַּֽ⁠אֲשֶׁר֙ דִּבֶּ֣ר יְהוָ֔ה וְ⁠כַ⁠אֲשֶׁ֛ר נִשְׁבַּ֥ע יְהוָ֖ה לָ⁠הֶ֑ם	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two expressions connected with **and**.

Within that sentence, you could also put the reason before the result. Alternate translation: [For the people of Israel were groaning because of their afflictors and oppressors. Yahweh had compassion on them, so he raised up judges for them]
2:18	eau5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הֵקִ֨ים יְהוָ֥ה ׀ לָ⁠הֶם֮ שֹֽׁפְטִים֒	1	See how you translated the expression **raised up** in [2:16](../02/16.md). Alternate translation: [Yahweh provided judges for them]
2:18	hz8j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠הֽוֹשִׁיעָ⁠ם֙	1	The pronoun **them** refers to the Israelites.

Alternate translation: [caused by their afflictors and their oppressors]
2:19	q63w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יָשֻׁ֨בוּ֙	1	The author is speaking as if the Israelites had literally been walking behind God but then **turned** away to walk in a different direction from him.

2:22	j085		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	אֶת־דֶּ֨רֶךְ יְהוָ֜ה	1	Yahweh is speaking about himself in the third person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: [my way]
2:22	j086		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	לָ⁠לֶ֣כֶת בָּ֗⁠ם	1	Since the pronoun **them** is plural, it is not a reference back to the **way** of Yahweh.

3:intro	k35h				0	# Judges 3 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n  - Verses 1–8: The Israelites lived with other nations and worshiped their gods\n  - Verses 9–11: God sent Othniel to rescue Israel from Aram\n  - Verses 12–30: God sent Ehud to rescue Israel from Moab\n  - Verse 31: God sent Shamgar to rescue Israel from the Philistines\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Yahweh allowed other nations to conquer Israel\n\nAs [3:5–8](../03/05.md) explains, Israel worshiped idols and false gods. Because of this, Yahweh allowed the nations of Aram and Moab to rule over them. In the period of Judges, when Israel sinned, they were often placed under the rule of a foreign power. However, when the people repented, Yahweh sent judges to deliver them. This chapter describes how Yahweh sent Othniel, Ehud, and Shamgar to rescue Israel from foreign control. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n### The carved images at Gilgal\n\nBiblical scholars are not entirely sure what the “carved images” mentioned in [3:19](../03/19.md) were. They could have been some kind of boundary marker. Some interpreters associate them with the twelve large stones that Joshua set up at Gilgal in Joshua [4:20](../../jos/04/20.md). They seem to have been a recognizable landmark of some kind. Once Ehud and the porters reached them, Ehud knew that the porters were back in Israelite territory and could find their way safely back home from there without him. In your translation, you might refer to these as “carved stones” or, as in the UST, “boundary stones.”

3:15	w4sk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אִ֥ישׁ אִטֵּ֖ר יַד־יְמִינ֑⁠וֹ	1	The author is speaking as if the Ehud literally had some limitation in the use of his **right hand**. In the context of this culture, the phrase probably indicates that he could use his left hand better than he could use his right hand but that he actually had no restriction in the use of either hand. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [a left-handed man]
3:15	j102		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וַ⁠יִּשְׁלְח֨וּ בְנֵי־יִשְׂרָאֵ֤ל בְּ⁠יָד⁠וֹ֙ מִנְחָ֔ה	1	The author is using the **hand** of Ehud to represent Ehud himself in the act of bringing **tribute** to Israel. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [And the sons of Israel sent tribute with Ehud]
3:16	j103		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ⁠לָ֛⁠הּ שְׁנֵ֥י פֵי֖וֹת	1	The author is speaking of Ehud’s **sword** as if it had been a living thing that had a **mouth** and could eat. This is probably a reference to the way a sword cuts into a person as if it were an animal biting him. Since the author speaks of the sword having **two** mouths, in this context the word **mouths** probably refers to the edges of the sword. Alternate translation: [it was double-edged]
3:16	fm5l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bdistance	גֹּ֣מֶד אָרְכָּ֑⁠הּ	1	The word translated as **cubit** describes the distance from a typical person’s elbow to the knuckles of his clenched fist. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express this distance in terms of modern measurements. Alternate translation: [it was about half a meter long] or [it was about eighteen inches long]
3:17	k42d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וְ⁠עֶגְל֕וֹן	1	The author is introducing background information that will help readers understand what happens next in the story. In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
3:18	j104		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יְשַׁלַּח֙ אֶת־הָ⁠עָ֔ם	1	The pronoun **he** refers to Ehud, not Eglon, in both instances in this verse. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: [that Ehud sent away the people]

3:19	j105		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠ה֣וּא שָׁ֗ב	1	The author is stating the pronoun **he** separately, even though the verb translated as **he turned back** already includes this meaning. He is doing that because he is contrasting what Ehud did with what the bearers of the tribute did. If a speaker of your language would use an explicit pronoun for the same purpose, you may want to use that construction in your translation. If not, your language may have other ways of showing the meaning here. Alternate translation: [But for his part, he turned back]
3:19	q56y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	הַ⁠פְּסִילִים֙	1	See the Introduction to this chapter for a discussion of what these **carved images** might have been and for some suggestions of how to describe them in your translation.
3:19	j106		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֹּ֕אמֶר	1	The author is leaving some information implicit that he assumes readers will understand. You could state this information explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [and he returned to King Eglon. Ehud said to him]
3:19	j107		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	דְּבַר־סֵ֥תֶר לִ֛⁠י אֵלֶ֖י⁠ךָ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **secrecy**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [I have something secret to tell you]
3:19	j108		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר הָ֔ס	1	“The pronoun **he** refers to Eglon. This could mean: (1) that he wanted silence in his court, and he specifically wanted everyone except him and Ehud to leave the room so that the court would be silent. Alternate translation: [And King Eglon told his servants, “Leave us here alone”]; (2) that he was telling Ehud not to say anything further, since his message was secret, until everyone else left. Alternate translation: [And King Eglon told Ehud, “Keep quiet for a moment”]
3:20	j109		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠אֵה֣וּד ׀ בָּ֣א אֵלָ֗י⁠ו וְ⁠הֽוּא־יֹ֠שֵׁב בַּ⁠עֲלִיַּ֨ת הַ⁠מְּקֵרָ֤ה אֲשֶׁר־ל⁠וֹ֙	1	The author is leaving some information implicit that he assumes readers will understand. You could state this information explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. The word **came** could indicate: (1) that Ehud walked up close to Eglon and stood in front of him. Alternate translation: [Then Ehud approached him. Now he was sitting in his upper room of coolness]; (2) that Ehud came into the **upper room** where Eglon was sitting. If so, this could mean that Ehud actually sent word to Eglon through his servants that he had a message for him, and Eglon summoned Ehud to come into his room where the two of them could speak privately once all the servants had left. Alternate translation: [Then Ehud entered the upper room of coolness in which the king was sitting]
3:20	j110		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וְ⁠הֽוּא־יֹ֠שֵׁב	1	The author is introducing background information that will help readers understand what happens next in the story. In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
3:20	f67g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	בַּ⁠עֲלִיַּ֨ת הַ⁠מְּקֵרָ֤ה אֲשֶׁר־ל⁠וֹ֙	1	The phrase **upper room of coolness** describes a room in a palace that was designed to give rulers a place to go to escape the heat of summer, which was intense in this climate. Sometimes these were interior rooms on whose walls the sun did not shine, and sometimes they were rooms in a garden within the palace complex. In this case, it seems to have been a room on the roof that was exposed to currents of air, since the author describes it with the term **upper room**. Your language and culture may have an expression to describe such a room. Alternate translation: [in his summer parlor] or [in his cool roof chamber]
3:20	p7ft		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וַ⁠יָּ֖קָם	1	King Eglon **arose** as a symbolic action to show respect for **God** and the message he thought God was sending to him through Ehud.

3:21	j111		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יִּתְקָעֶ֖⁠הָ בְּ⁠בִטְנֽ⁠וֹ	1	The pronoun **he** refers to Ehud, and the pronoun **his** refers to Eglon. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: [and Ehud thrust the sword into Eglon’s belly]
3:22	j112		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	וַ⁠יִּסְגֹּ֤ר הַ⁠חֵ֨לֶב֙ בְּעַ֣ד הַ⁠לַּ֔הַב כִּ֣י לֹ֥א שָׁלַ֛ף הַ⁠חֶ֖רֶב מִ⁠בִּטְנ֑⁠וֹ	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: [and since Ehud did not pull the sword from Eglon’s belly, the fat closed around the handle]
3:22	k49p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	וַ⁠יֵּצֵ֖א הַֽ⁠פַּרְשְׁדֹֽנָ⁠ה	1	The word translated as **excrement** occurs only here in the Old Testament, so its meaning is not entirely certain. This could mean: (1) that Eglon’s bowels discharged from the force and shock of the sword thrust. (See the Introduction to this chapter for a further discussion of this possibility.) Your language may have a way of referring to this discreetly. Alternate translation: [and he soiled himself]; (2) that the point of the sword came out the other side of Eglon’s body. Alternate translation: [and the point came out the other side]; (3) that Ehud went out to a chamber within this room before leaving the room itself. Alternate translation: [and he went out to the vestibule]
3:23	djg4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	הַֽ⁠מִּסְדְּר֑וֹנָ⁠ה	1	The word translated as **porch** occurs only here in the Old Testament, so its meaning is not entirely certain. Most interpreters understand it to mean a covered entrance area just outside the room Ehud had been in. Your language and culture may have an expression to describe such an area. Alternate translation: [to the vestibule]
3:24	j113		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠ה֤וּא יָצָא֙ וַ⁠עֲבָדָ֣י⁠ו בָּ֔אוּ	1	The pronoun **he** refers to Ehud, and the pronoun **his** refers to Eglon. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: [And Ehud went out, and Eglon’s servants came]

Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. You could also state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [and they discovered that the doors of the upper room were bolted]
3:24	j115		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	דַּלְת֥וֹת הָ⁠עֲלִיָּ֖ה נְעֻל֑וֹת	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [someone had bolted the doors of the upper room]
3:24	z2qt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	מֵסִ֥יךְ ה֛וּא אֶת־רַגְלָ֖י⁠ו	1	The servants are using the phrase **covering his feet** as a polite way of referring to an activity that is done in private. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: [he is going to the bathroom]
3:24	j116		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	בַּ⁠חֲדַ֥ר הַ⁠מְּקֵרָֽה	1	See how you translated the expression “the upper room of coolness” in [3:20](../03/20.md). The word **chamber** here is different from the word “upper chamber” there, but the author is referring to the same room, so you can use the same expression here as you did there.
3:25	d7zv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עַד־בּ֔וֹשׁ	1	The author implicitly means that the servants **felt ashamed** because they were supposed to stay in the king’s presence and remain available to fulfill any request of his. (The author describes these servants in [3:19](../03/19.md) as those who were usually “standing around” him.) You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [until they felt they were neglecting their duty]
3:25	e1jf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	אֶת־הַ⁠מַּפְתֵּ֨חַ֙	1	The word translated as **opener** refers to a device that people in this culture used to release the inside bolt of a door from the outside. It was a bar of wood, hooked on one end, that people would pass through a hole in a door in order to catch and lift the bolt inside. If the word **opener** would be unclear and it would be difficult or complicated to explain what it was, you could use a general expression in your translation. Alternate translation: [the key]
3:26	r2ig		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	וְ⁠אֵה֥וּד נִמְלַ֖ט עַ֣ד הִֽתְמַהְמְהָ֑⁠ם	1	Since Ehud escaping is new information, it may be more natural in your language to present it after the information that readers already have, about Eglon’s servants **delaying**. Alternate translation: [Now while they were delaying, Ehud escaped]
3:26	j118		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	אֶת־הַ⁠פְּסִילִ֔ים	1	See how you translated the same expression in [3:19](../03/19.md).
3:27	j119		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יִּתְקַ֥ע בַּ⁠שּׁוֹפָ֖ר	1	The author means implicitly that Ehud **blew on the shofar** to summon the Israelites to battle. The UST models one way to indicate this explicitly.
3:27	j120		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	בַּ⁠שּׁוֹפָ֖ר	1	A **shofar** is the horn of a ram (a male sheep) that has been made into a musical instrument.

4:intro	pjw5				0	# Judges 4 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n### The place of this story in the book\n\nTo this point, after giving an introduction to the stories of the judges ([1:1–3:6](../01/01.md)), the author has briefly described the work of three judges: Othniel ([3:7–11](../03/07.md)), Ehud ([3:12–30](../03/12.md)), and Shamgar ([3:31](../03/31.md)). In this chapter, he describes at more length the work of another judge, Deborah, and the man she called and helped to lead an Israelite army, Barak.\n\n### The ending of the story\n\nIn [verses 23](../04/23.md) and [24](../04/24.md), the author ends the story with a summary of what happened. He presents the information in a special form called a chiasm, in which the first and last parts match and the middle parts match. These parts match: “So on that day God subdued Jabin, the king of Canaan” and “until that they destroyed Jabin, the king of Canaan.” These parts also match: “to the face of the sons of Israel” and “For going, the hand of the sons of Israel went and {became} severe against Jabin, the king of Canaan.” You may be able to show this in your translation by using some special formatting. For example:\nSo on that day God subdued Jabin, the king of Canaan\n to the face of the sons of Israel\n For going, the hand of the sons of Israel went and {became}\n severe against Jabin, the king of Canaan\n until that they destroyed Jabin, the king of Canaan.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### How had Yahweh already begun to fight Sisera before the Israelites attacked?\n\nIn [4:14](../04/14.md), Deborah tells Barak that it is time to attack Sisera’s forces because Yahweh has already begun to fight against them. It is not clear from this chapter entirely what this means. But readers learn in the next chapter that there was a great storm on the day of this battle. Deborah says in her song (in [5:4](../05/04.md)) that when Yahweh marched out, “dark clouds dripped down water” and “the earth shook” (perhaps a reference to thunder). She speaks in [5:21](../05/21.md) of the Kishon River flooding. The historian Josephus writes of this battle that “as soon as the armies were engaged, there arose a prodigious tempest of hail and rain, which drove in the faces of the Canaanites, and occasioned a total rout of them.” With the rain, hail, and flooding, Sisera’s forces were not able to make use of their chariots. Barak was able to lead his troops down from the relative safety of Mount Tabor onto the plain and destroy Sisera’s army and its chariots.\n\n### “Yahweh will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman”\n\nWhen Deborah tells Barak to raise an army to oppose Sisera, he replies, “If you will go with me, then I will go, but if you will not go with me, I will not go” ([4:8](../04/08.md)). Deborah agrees to go with him, but she also tells him that the credit and honor for killing Sisera will not go to him but to a woman. Interpreters have many different ideas about what this means. One possibility is that Barak was insisting on having visible, tangible assurance of God’s presence and help in the person of Deborah, who was a prophetess. Deborah graciously agreed to accompany Barak and provide this assurance, but at the same time she indicated to him that God’s power was so great that Barak should not have put this condition on his obedience. God would use a woman, who in this culture would not have been a warrior, to kill Sisera. At this time, great honor came from killing an enemy commander, and this honor would not go to Barak but to this woman and ultimately to God, who would arrange the circumstances for it. However, it is not necessary to resolve the meaning of this exchange in order to translate this passage. You can report the conversation between Deborah and Barak naturally in your translation without adding any interpretation.

For emphasis, the author is saying it first positively and then negatively. If a speaker of your language would not use repetition like this, in your translation you can convey the emphasis in a different way. Alternate translation: [and every single one of Sisera’s soldiers fell by the mouth of the sword]
4:16	j148		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יִּפֹּ֞ל	1	The author is using the word **fell** to mean “died,” by association with the way that people fall down when they die. Alternate translation: [and … died]

Since there was **peace between** Jabin and Heber, Sisera felt that he could safely go to Heber’s compound and find protection there. In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
4:17	s2ne		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וּ⁠בֵ֕ין בֵּ֖ית חֶ֥בֶר הַ⁠קֵּינִֽי	1	The author is using the term **house** to mean an entire household living together. Alternate translation: [and the extended family of Heber the Kenite]

4:18	u5k9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	בַּ⁠שְּׂמִיכָֽה	1	The word translated as **blanket** occurs only here in the Old Testament, so its meaning is not entirely certain. The word could refer to: (1) something that people use to keep warm in bed. Alternate translation: [with a coverlet]; (2) something that people put on the floor for warmth and decorative purposes. Alternate translation: [with a carpet]; (3) an outer garment. Alternate translation: [with a cloak]

4:21	ctd6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	אֶת־יְתַ֨ד הָ⁠אֹ֜הֶל & אֶת־הַ⁠מַּקֶּ֣בֶת	1	The phrase **a peg of the tent** describes a pointed piece of wood or metal that people drive into the ground to hold down a corner of a tent. A **hammer** in this context refers to a heavy tool made of wood that people use to hit objects with force, for example, in order to drive a tent peg into the ground. If your readers would not be familiar with these objects, in your translation you could use the name of similar things that your readers would recognize, or you could use general expressions. Alternate translation: [a spike … a mallet] or [a sharp piece of wood … a heavy tool]

Alternate translation: [at that time]

In another sense, the author is speaking of **God** to represent all of the forces on the side of **Israel**, including God, and he is using **Jabin** to represent that king and his army. The UST models one way to represent this second sense.
4:24	j159		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	וַ⁠תֵּ֜לֶךְ יַ֤ד בְּנֵֽי־יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ הָל֣וֹךְ וְ⁠קָשָׁ֔ה	1	The author is repeating forms of the verb “go”—**going** and **went**—in order to intensify the idea that this word expresses. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: [For the hand of the sons of Israel became more and more severe]
4:24	j160		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	יָבִ֣ין מֶֽלֶךְ־כְּנָ֑עַן & אֵ֖ת יָבִ֥ין מֶֽלֶךְ־כְּנָֽעַן	1	The author is repeating this phrase for emphasis.

4:24	zcb9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הִכְרִ֔יתוּ אֵ֖ת יָבִ֥ין	1	The author is using the name **Jabin** by association to mean the army of this king, which the Israelites **destroyed**. (The book does not say specifically that the Israelites killed Jabin himself.) Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: [they broke the power of Jabin]
5:intro	jgd9				0	# Judges 5 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nIn this chapter, the author presents a song that Deborah and Barak sang to celebrate the victory that Yahweh enabled them to win over Sisera.\n\nSome translations prefer to set apart quotations, prayers, and songs with special formatting. The ULT and many other English translations set the lines of chapter 5, which is a song, farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### How were the Israelites able to fight against Sisera if they had no weapons?\n\nIn [5:8](../05/08.md), this song describes how Jabin’s occupying soldiers took away the weapons that the Israelites had. So how were the Israelites able to fight a battle against Sisera’s forces? As a note to [4:2](../04/02.md) explains, the name Harosheth Hagoyim may describe a place where Jabin forced captive peoples to cut wood for him. It has been suggested that the conscripted Israelites who joined Barak’s army took their axes and hatchets with them and used them as weapons. \n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Hebrew poetry\n\nExcept for a brief introduction and conclusion, this chapter is poetry that consists of pairs of phrases that repeat the same meaning. The second phrase advances the idea of the first by affirming, contrasting, or supplementing it in different words. (Sometimes there is a third line with similar meaning.) Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both (or all three) phrases in your translation. It may be clearer in your language to connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the idea of the first one, not saying something different. For example, in [5:2](../05/02.md) you might say, “For the loosening of long hair in Israel, yes, for the volunteering of the people.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])\n\n### Deborah and Barak singing this song together\n\nWhile the author says in [5:1](../05/01.md) that both “Deborah and Barak” sang this song, the first-person verbs and pronouns in it are singular. It was common for the Israelites to sing in responsive parts, so it may be that Deborah and Barak each sang parts of this song individually, responding to one another. For example, it seems probable that in [5:12](../05/12.md) Barak sang “awake, Deborah” and Deborah responded “Arise, Barak.”\n\nHebrew does not mark first-person pronouns or verbs for gender, so it is not clear in many cases which of them sang which parts, although in some cases the text does give us a fair idea. For the sake of languages that do mark first-person singular pronouns or verbs for gender, here are some suggestions as to who might be singing when the song says “I” or “my.” This is, however, largely a matter of interpretation, so use your own best judgment in your translation. Since Deborah and Barak are, in a sense, speaking for each other, another alternative would be to use plural first-person pronouns. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd]])\n\n  - In [5:3](../05/03.md), you could consider using masculine forms for “I … {even} I, let me sing” and feminine forms for “I will make music.” The verb translated as “make music” refers to singing with an instrumental accompaniment. Deborah was a prophetess, and the Old Testament prophets appear to have sung at least some of their prophecies to instrumental accompaniment. (See, for example, [Ezekiel 33:32](../../ezk/33/32.md).) So it is perhaps more likely that Deborah sang “I will make music” and Barak sang “let me sing.”\n  - Deborah is speaking of herself as “I” in [5:7](../05/07.md), so it would be appropriate to use feminine forms there.\n  - It has been suggested that in [5:9](../05/09.md), it would be more appropriate for Deborah to thank the leaders, who would have included Barak, and for Barak to thank those who volunteered in response to his summons. So you may wish to mark “My” as feminine.\n  - Barak is probably referring to himself as “me” in [5:13](../05/13.md), since he was the one who led the Israelite army “against the warriors” of Sisera.\n  - Barak seems to be speaking in [5:15](../05/15.md), “my commanders in Issachar were with Deborah,” because otherwise Deborah would be speaking of herself in the third person, which she does not seem to do in this song.\n  - It has been suggested that in [5:21](../05/21.md), Barak may have described the Kishon River flooding, since he saw this first-hand in the battle, and then said, “March on, my soul, in strength,” recalling how the Israelite soldiers pursued the attack against Sisera vigorously when they saw how the flooding had put them and their chariots at a disadvantage.\n\n### A different setting for part of the song\n\nThere is an apparent change of setting in [5:10–11](../05/10.md), from the original performance of the song at a victory celebration to its repeated recitation at places where travelers stopped along the road for water. In this part of the song, Deborah and Barak are not addressing people who are not present as if they could hear them. That is a poetic device that writers and speakers in the Bible sometimes use, but it does not occur here. Rather, [verses 10](../05/10.md) and [11](../05/11.md) of the song reflect its later use at “watering places” to commemorate the victory over Sisera and Jabin. So translate [verse 10](../05/10.md) as a direct address to people who are present.
5:1	w7ex		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בַּ⁠יּ֥וֹם הַ⁠ה֖וּא	1	As in [4:23](../04/23.md), here the word **day** may refer not to a single day but to a more general time. The author may not mean that Deborah and Barak sang this song on the actual day on which the Israelites defeated the forces of King Jabin, but rather during that general time. Alternate translation: [at the time when the Israelites defeated the forces of King Jabin]
5:1	j161		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠תָּ֣שַׁר דְּבוֹרָ֔ה וּ⁠בָרָ֖ק בֶּן־אֲבִינֹ֑עַם בַּ⁠יּ֥וֹם הַ⁠ה֖וּא לֵ⁠אמֹֽר	1	The author is using the term **saying** to introduce a direct quotation of the song that Deborah and Barak **sang**. In your translation, use a natural way of introducing direct quotations in your language. Alternate translation: [So Deborah and Barak, the son of Abinoam, sang the following song on that day]
5:2	j162		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	בִּ⁠פְרֹ֤עַ פְּרָעוֹת֙ בְּ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל בְּ⁠הִתְנַדֵּ֖ב עָ֑ם	1	This is the beginning of the song that Deborah and Barak sang. You may wish to indicate this with an opening first-level quotation mark or with some other punctuation or convention that your language uses to indicate the start of a first-level quotation. You may also be able to use special formatting to set off the song as poetry, as the ULT does.
5:2	j163		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	בִּ⁠פְרֹ֤עַ פְּרָעוֹת֙ בְּ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל בְּ⁠הִתְנַדֵּ֖ב עָ֑ם	1	These two phrases mean similar things. See the Introduction to this chapter for a discussion of how to translate such similar phrases throughout this song.
5:2	j164		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	בִּ⁠פְרֹ֤עַ פְּרָעוֹת֙ בְּ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל	1	While scholars disagree about how to translate and understand this phrase, it seems to be describing the practice of taking a vow not to cut one’s hair until a certain objective is achieved, in this case, the defeat of Sisera’s army. Growing long hair was thus a symbolic action that expressed the determination to achieve this objective. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: [For the Israelites who vowed to defeat Sisera’s army]
5:2	j165		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	בִּ⁠פְרֹ֤עַ פְּרָעוֹת֙ בְּ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל	1	For emphasis and poetic effect, Deborah and Barak are using a construction in which a verb and its object come from the same root. That is, the word translated as **long hair** describes hair that is flowing freely or loosely, and the word translated as **loosening** describes not braiding that hair or binding it with a turban. Your language may have terms available that will allow you to use the same construction in your translation to express the meaning here. Alternatively, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis and poetic effect, if you do not express the meaning in plain language. Alternate translation: [For freely flowing hair in Israel]
5:2	s181		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בְּ⁠הִתְנַדֵּ֖ב עָ֑ם	1	Deborah and Barak are referring implicitly to people **volunteering** to fight against Israel’s enemies. You could state this information explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [for the people who volunteered to fight]
5:2	j166		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	בָּרֲכ֖וּ	1	The imperative verb **bless** is plural here because Deborah and Barak are addressing an audience of many people, so use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
5:3	hs8j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe	שִׁמְע֣וּ מְלָכִ֔ים הַאֲזִ֖ינוּ רֹֽזְנִ֑ים	1	Deborah and Barak are speaking to two groups that they know cannot hear them. They are doing this to show in a strong way how they feel about the story they are telling in their song. They feel that it is worth the attention of the most important people in the world. They are actually speaking to all the people who can hear them or who will hear them. ([5:10–11](../05/10.md) indicates that this includes people from throughout Israelite society.) If your readers might not understand what Deborah and Barak are doing, you could translate their words as if they were speaking directly to people who were present. Alternate translation: [This story deserves to be heard by kings and rulers!]
5:3	j167		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אָֽנֹכִ֗י לַֽ⁠יהוָה֙ אָנֹכִ֣י אָשִׁ֔ירָה אֲזַמֵּ֕ר	1	If your language marks first-person singular pronouns or verbs for gender, see the discussion in the Introduction to this chapter for a suggestion of how to mark the instances of **I** here.
5:3	j168		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	אָשִׁ֔ירָה	1	The speaker here is not asking permission. He is using a particular verb tense to encourage himself to do something. If your language does not use this type of verb, in your translation you can use an equivalent type. Alternate translation: [I certainly should sing]
5:4	f5pu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יְהוָ֗ה בְּ⁠צֵאתְ⁠ךָ֤ מִ⁠שֵּׂעִיר֙ בְּ⁠צַעְדְּ⁠ךָ֙ מִ⁠שְּׂדֵ֣ה אֱד֔וֹם	1	The song is speaking as if Yahweh had literally traveled from or across the land of **Seir**, that is, **Edom**, in order to lead the Israelites into battle against Sisera. This could mean: (1) that the song is envisioning Mount Sinai as Yahweh’s dwelling place on earth and describing the route that Yahweh would have taken from there to the battlefield. Alternate translation: [Yahweh, when you came across Seir to fight against Sisera, when you marched across the fields of Edom]; (2) that the song is referring to the time when the Israelites left Edom to start conquering the people in Canaan and speaking of Yahweh as if he had been a warrior leading the Israelite army at that time. Alternate translation: [Yahweh, it was just like the time when you first led our armies into Canaan from Seir. It was as if you marched ahead of us across the fields of Edom]
5:4	vj7e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	מִ⁠שְּׂדֵ֣ה אֱד֔וֹם	1	The song is not referring to a specific **field** in **Edom**. It means the cultivated land in Edom in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: [from the fields of Edom]
5:4	hw54		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֶ֣רֶץ רָעָ֔שָׁה גַּם־שָׁמַ֖יִם נָטָ֑פוּ גַּם־עָבִ֖ים נָ֥טְפוּ מָֽיִם	1	The song seems to be referring implicitly to the great storm that rendered Sisera’s chariots useless for the battle. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [the earth trembled from the thunder and there was a heavy downpour]
5:5	p4qp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הָרִ֥ים נָזְל֖וּ	1	The song is speaking as if the **mountains** above the battlefield had literally **flowed** down onto it. This seems to be a reference to the way the downpour made the mountain streams overflow. (Ultimately, they fed into the Kishon River, and it flooded the battlefield. See [5:21](../05/21.md).) This might also be an allusion to the way that the overflowing streams would have carried dirt, branches, rocks, etc., down from the mountains, as if the mountains themselves were coming down onto the plain. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [The mountain streams overflowed]
5:5	wuf5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	זֶ֣ה סִינַ֔י מִ⁠פְּנֵ֕י יְהוָ֖ה	1	The song is saying that what happened to the mountains above the battlefield was just like what happened when Yahweh appeared to the Israelites at Mount Sinai. When he did, according to [Exodus 19:16–18](../../exo/19/16.md), there was also a thunderstorm and the mountain shook. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [just as Mount Sinai trembled when Yahweh appeared there in a storm]
5:6	rw34		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	בִּ⁠ימֵ֞י שַׁמְגַּ֤ר בֶּן־עֲנָת֙ בִּ⁠ימֵ֣י יָעֵ֔ל	1	The song is speaking of two time periods in order to mean the time in between them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [Between the time when Shamgar son of Anath defeated the Philistines and the time when Jael killed Sisera]
5:6	ki5e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	חָדְל֖וּ אֳרָח֑וֹת	1	The song is speaking as if the **roads** in Israel had literally **ceased** to exist. It means that people stopped using the main roads because it had become too dangerous to travel on them. Jabin’s forces were apparently occupying Israel, and his soldiers would plunder the goods that anyone was transporting. (This means that, in a sense, the roads literally did cease to exist, since they were dirt roads and grass would have grown back over them. One translation option would be to say this and let readers realize the implications.) Alternate translation: [people stopped using the main roads] or [grass grew back over the roads]
5:6	i6j5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠הֹלְכֵ֣י נְתִיב֔וֹת יֵלְכ֕וּ אֳרָח֖וֹת עֲקַלְקַלּֽוֹת	1	The song means implicitly that because people needed to stay off the main roads for safety, they took back roads that wound through the countryside. You could indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [and travelers had to take roundabout back routes]
5:7	j170		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	חָדְל֧וּ פְרָז֛וֹן בְּ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל חָדֵ֑לּוּ עַ֤ד שַׁ⁠קַּ֨מְתִּי֙ דְּבוֹרָ֔ה שַׁ⁠קַּ֥מְתִּי אֵ֖ם בְּ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	Deborah is repeating the verbs **ceased** and **arose** in order to intensify the ideas that they express. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: [The peasantry completely ceased in Israel until when I, Deborah, arose triumphantly as a mother in Israel]
5:7	j169		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	חָדְל֧וּ פְרָז֛וֹן בְּ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל חָדֵ֑לּוּ	1	The song is speaking as if the rural population of Israel had literally **ceased** to exist. The meaning is that no one was living in the countryside anymore because the rural people hid in the mountains or moved into fortified cities for safety. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [Everyone had to move from the countryside into the cities where it was safer]
5:7	j171		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	בְּ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל & בְּ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could use another term to refer to **Israel** in the second instance, rather than repeating the name. Alternate translation: [in Israel … there]
5:7	j172		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	עַ֤ד שַׁ⁠קַּ֨מְתִּי֙ דְּבוֹרָ֔ה שַׁ⁠קַּ֥מְתִּי אֵ֖ם בְּ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	Deborah is using the expression **arose** to mean that she took on a particular role. She is not referring to getting up from sitting beneath her palm tree to accompany Barak. The role she is describing included settling the Israelites’ disputes there. Alternate translation: [but then I, Deborah, became a mother in Israel]
5:7	n27x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	שַׁ⁠קַּ֨מְתִּי֙ דְּבוֹרָ֔ה שַׁ⁠קַּ֥מְתִּי אֵ֖ם בְּ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	Deborah is speaking of herself as if she had literally become the **mother** of the Israelites. She means that she became a leader who cared for the Israelites the way a mother takes care of her children. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning as a comparison. Alternate translation: [when I, Deborah, became a leader who took care of the Israelites the way a mother takes care of her children]
5:8	mxk4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	יִבְחַר֙ אֱלֹהִ֣ים חֲדָשִׁ֔ים	1	The pronoun **He** refers back to “Israel” in the previous verse, meaning the people of Israel. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: [The people of Israel chose new gods]
5:8	duj5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	אָ֖ז לָחֶ֣ם שְׁעָרִ֑ים	1	The song is using one part of cities, their **gates**, to mean entire cities. The gates are chosen to represent the cities because that is where enemies would attack to try to get into the city and conquer it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [then enemy armies besieged the cities]
5:8	j173		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מָגֵ֤ן אִם־יֵֽרָאֶה֙ וָ⁠רֹ֔מַח בְּ⁠אַרְבָּעִ֥ים אֶ֖לֶף בְּ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	The song is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [a shield or spear was not seen among 40,000 in Israel!]
5:8	dl2n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers	מָגֵ֤ן אִם־יֵֽרָאֶה֙ וָ⁠רֹ֔מַח בְּ⁠אַרְבָּעִ֥ים אֶ֖לֶף בְּ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	The song is using the number **40,000** as a customary way of saying “very many.” Alternate translation: [one could hardly find a single shield or spear among a large number of Israelites]
5:8	v83h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	מָגֵ֤ן אִם־יֵֽרָאֶה֙ וָ⁠רֹ֔מַח	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [did anyone see a shield or a spear]
5:8	j174		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מָגֵ֤ן אִם־יֵֽרָאֶה֙ וָ⁠רֹ֔מַח	1	The song is using the fact that no shield or spear could be **seen** by association to mean that no Israelites had these weapons. (Jabin’s occupying forces has apparently confiscated all of the weapons that the Israelites had.) Alternate translation: [was there a single shield or spear]
5:8	j175		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	מָגֵ֤ן אִם־יֵֽרָאֶה֙ וָ⁠רֹ֔מַח	1	The author is using two weapons, a **shield** and a **spear**, to mean weapons of all kinds. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [were there any weapons]
5:9	u5zy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לִבִּ⁠י֙ לְ⁠חוֹקְקֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל	1	In this culture, people regarded the **heart** as the location of human feelings. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [I am so happy about what the commanders of Israel did]
5:9	j176		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	בָּרֲכ֖וּ	1	As in [5:2](../05/02.md), the imperative verb **bless** is plural here, so use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
5:10	j177		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	רֹכְבֵי֩ אֲתֹנ֨וֹת צְחֹר֜וֹת יֹשְׁבֵ֧י עַל־מִדִּ֛ין וְ⁠הֹלְכֵ֥י עַל־דֶּ֖רֶךְ	1	See the discussion in the Introduction to this chapter of the apparent change of setting in [5:10–11](../05/10.md), from the original performance of the song at a victory celebration to its repeated recitation at places where travelers stopped along the road for water.
5:10	dt2p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	רֹכְבֵי֩ אֲתֹנ֨וֹת צְחֹר֜וֹת יֹשְׁבֵ֧י עַל־מִדִּ֛ין וְ⁠הֹלְכֵ֥י עַל־דֶּ֖רֶךְ	1	The song is speaking of two kinds of people, rich and poor, in order to mean all kinds of people. (Wealthier people would have animals to ride and carpet to sit on as they traveled; poorer people would walk on foot.) If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [All of you who pass by this place]
5:10	vf24		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	מִדִּ֛ין	1	The word translated as **carpet** describes something that people would put on the back of a riding animal to make the rider more comfortable. If your readers would not be familiar with such an object, you could use a general expression in your translation. Alternate translation: [saddle blankets]
5:11	j179		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	מִ⁠קּ֣וֹל מְחַֽצְצִ֗ים	1	The song is using the **voice** of these **singers** to represent the song they are singing with their voices. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [From the song of the singers]
5:11	v4bj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	מִ⁠קּ֣וֹל מְחַֽצְצִ֗ים	1	Since the song is referring to a group of people, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **voice**. Alternate translation: [From the voices of the singers]
5:11	j180		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	צִדְק֣וֹת יְהוָ֔ה צִדְקֹ֥ת פִּרְזֹנ֖⁠וֹ בְּ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל	1	The song is using the term **righteous** to describe the victory that **Yahweh** and his **peasantry** (the volunteer soldiers) won over Sisera. This is by association with the fact that it was wrong for Jabin to oppress the Israelites, and so by defeating him, the victors restored a situation that was right or **righteous**. Alternate translation: [what Yahweh and his peasantry in Israel did to restore a right situation]
5:11	f6il		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	יָרְד֥וּ לַ⁠שְּׁעָרִ֖ים	1	The song is using one part of cities, their **gates**, to mean entire cities. See how you translated the same expression in [5:8](../05/08.md). Alternate translation: [returned to live in the cities that their enemies had conquered]
5:12	de7e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	עוּרִ֤י עוּרִי֙ דְּבוֹרָ֔ה ע֥וּרִי ע֖וּרִי דַּבְּרִי־שִׁ֑יר	1	The song is addressing Deborah as if she were literally asleep and needed to wake up. (Baruk may be singing this part; see the discussion in the Introduction to this chapter.) This is actually a call for Deborah to apply vitality and creativity to the task of celebrating Yahweh’s victory through this song. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: [Come on, Deborah, sing in a lively way!]
5:12	j181		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	עוּרִ֤י עוּרִי֙ דְּבוֹרָ֔ה ע֥וּרִי ע֖וּרִי דַּבְּרִי־שִׁ֑יר	1	The song is repeating the word **awake** in order to intensify the idea that it expresses. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: [You certainly must not be drowsy as you sing, Deborah!]
5:12	j182		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	דַּבְּרִי־שִׁ֑יר	1	This does not mean that Deborah should stop singing and only speak the words of the song. It is actually play on words in Hebrew: the word translated as **speak** has the same three root letters as Deborah’s name, D-B-R. Your language may have an expression that you could use in your translation to bring out the meaning here. Alternate translation: [make the song your own]
5:12	j183		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ק֥וּם	1	The expression **Arise** does not mean that Barak should get out of bed or stand up from a seated position. Rather, it means that Barak should take action. Deborah could be the one singing this line (see the discussion in the Introduction to this chapter), and it could be intentionally reminiscent of [4:14](../04/14.md), where she used the same expression to tell him that it was time to attack Sisera. See how you translated the expression there.
5:12	j184		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	וּֽ⁠שֲׁבֵ֥ה שֶׁבְיְ⁠ךָ֖	1	For emphasis, the song is using a construction in which a verb and its object come from the same root. You may be able to use the same construction in your language to express the meaning here. Alternatively, your language may have another way of showing the emphasis. Alternate translation: [and lead away all of your prisoners]
5:12	j185		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	וּֽ⁠שֲׁבֵ֥ה שֶׁבְיְ⁠ךָ֖	1	The song is using this possessive form to speak to Barak about the group of people that he and his army have taken prisoner. It is not saying that Barak himself is in **captivity**. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: [and lead away all the prisoners you have captured]
5:12	j186		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וּֽ⁠שֲׁבֵ֥ה שֶׁבְיְ⁠ךָ֖	1	The song is leaving some information implicit that listeners are expected to understand. It is possible that the original occasion of this song was a victory celebration through which captured enemy soldiers were paraded in order to dramatize the victory. Barak, as the army commander, would have led this procession. You could suggest this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [and parade the captured enemy soldiers in a victory procession]
5:13	j187		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	יְרַ֣ד שָׂרִ֔יד לְ⁠אַדִּירִ֖ים עָ֑ם יְהוָ֕ה יְרַד־לִ֖⁠י	1	While the expression **came down** in both instances is probably a literal reference to travel down from higher elevations to a plain, the implicit meaning is that the **remnant** and **people** were gathering on a level place as troops for battle under the command of the **nobles** and Barak. You could indicate this in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [the remnant gathered to the nobles, the people of Yahweh gathered to me]
5:13	j188		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	יְרַ֣ד שָׂרִ֔יד לְ⁠אַדִּירִ֖ים	1	The phrase translated as **to the nobles** could also be a possessive form and mean “of the nobles.” There would not be a significant difference in meaning. Alternate translation: [the remnant of the nobles came down]
5:13	tle3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	לִ֖⁠י	1	The pronoun **me** probably refers to Barak, since he was the one who led the Israelite army **against the warriors** of Sisera. Even if your language does not need to mark first-person pronouns for gender, it may be helpful to clarify the reference for your readers. Otherwise, they might take it to be Deborah, since she clearly spoke in the first person in [5:7](../05/07.md) and probably did in [5:9](../05/09.md) as well. Alternate translation, as in the UST: [to me, Barak]
5:14	j189		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	מִנִּ֣י אֶפְרַ֗יִם שָׁרְשָׁ⁠ם֙ בַּ⁠עֲמָלֵ֔ק אַחֲרֶ֥י⁠ךָ בִנְיָמִ֖ין בַּֽ⁠עֲמָמֶ֑י⁠ךָ & וּ⁠מִ֨⁠זְּבוּלֻ֔ן מֹשְׁכִ֖ים בְּ⁠שֵׁ֥בֶט סֹפֵֽר	1	In these phrases, the song is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: [Some from Ephraim, whose root is in Amalek, came down; they came after you, Benjamin, with your peoples … and from Zebulun, the ones holding onto the scepter of a scribe also came down]
5:14	e478		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מִנִּ֣י אֶפְרַ֗יִם שָׁרְשָׁ⁠ם֙ בַּ⁠עֲמָלֵ֔ק	1	The song is speaking as if the people of the tribe of Ephraim were literally a plant whose **root** was in the territory that formerly belonged to the Amalek people group. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [People from the tribe of Ephraim, which defeated the Amalekites and took their territory]
5:14	k3ph		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe	אַחֲרֶ֥י⁠ךָ בִנְיָמִ֖ין בַּֽ⁠עֲמָמֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1	Here the song could be speaking to a group of people who are not there to hear it, the people of the tribe of **Benjamin**, in order to express strong approval of the way the soldiers from that tribe came and fought for Israel. The song would actually be speaking to the people who could hear it, initially the soldiers and others who gathered for the victory celebration at which it was first performed. However, some people from the tribe of Benjamin probably were present at the celebration, so the direct address with **you** and **your** could be literal. On the other hand, as [5:9–10](../05/09.md) shows, this song was later sung in other contexts where people from Benjamin were not necessarily present. So it may be clearer in some languages to translate this without using second-person pronouns and to express the emphasis in some other way. Alternate translation: [they followed the brave soldiers from the tribe of Benjamin]
5:14	j190		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	מִנִּ֣י מָכִ֗יר יָֽרְדוּ֙ מְחֹ֣קְקִ֔ים	1	The song is using these **commanders** to refer to them and the troops they commanded. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [the military leaders from Machir brought their soldiers]
5:14	yna1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	מִנִּ֣י מָכִ֗יר	1	The word **Machir** is the name of a man, the son of Manasseh.
5:14	j191		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִנִּ֣י מָכִ֗יר	1	The name **Machir** could mean: (1) the descendants of Machir, who formed one part of the tribe of Manasseh. Alternate translation: [from the clan of Machir]; (2) by association, the tribe of Manasseh. Alternate translation: [from the tribe of Manasseh]
5:14	rl91		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וּ⁠מִ֨⁠זְּבוּלֻ֔ן מֹשְׁכִ֖ים בְּ⁠שֵׁ֥בֶט סֹפֵֽר	1	The military leaders of the tribe of **Zebulun** each carried a **scepter** as a symbolic action to indicate their rank and position. Each leader is called a **scribe** because one of his duties was to record the names of soldiers who enlisted and keep a total of the number of soldiers in the army. But the focus here is not on that duty but on the fact that these were military leaders, like the **commanders** mentioned in the previous phrase. Alternate translation: [and the military commanders of the tribe of Zebulun also brought their soldiers]
5:15	ruv4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וְ⁠שָׂרַ֤⁠י בְּ⁠יִשָּׂשכָר֙ עִם־דְּבֹרָ֔ה	1	Here again the song is using part of an army, its **commanders**, to mean all of the army. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [And the soldiers and officers I commanded who were from Issachar also supported Deborah]
5:15	j192		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠יִשָּׂשכָר֙ כֵּ֣ן בָּרָ֔ק	1	This expression means that the first person or group mentioned was willing to do whatever the second person mentioned wanted to do. (See, for example, [1 Kings 22:4](../../1ki/22/04.md).) If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [and the soldiers from Issachar were willing to do whatever Barak ordered]
5:15	z2wa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	בָּ⁠עֵ֖מֶק שֻׁלַּ֣ח בְּ⁠רַגְלָ֑י⁠ו	1	This could mean: (1) that the pronoun **he** refers to Issachar, that is, the soldiers from the tribe of Issachar, and the pronoun **his** refers to Barak. In that case, the phrase **at his feet** would mean the same thing as in [4:10](../04/10.md). Alternate translation: [those soldiers were sent into a valley under Barak’s command]; (2) that both the pronoun **he** and the pronoun **his** refer to Barak. In that case, the last phrase would be translated “on his feet,” and it would be a reference to the courage of Barak and his soldiers, who fought against chariots on foot. Alternate translation: [he was sent into a valley to fight against chariots on foot]
5:15	j193		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	בָּ⁠עֵ֖מֶק שֻׁלַּ֣ח בְּ⁠רַגְלָ֑י⁠ו	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. While it was Deborah who told Barak in [4:14](../04/14.md) to go down and attack Sisera, she did this as a prophetess speaking for Yahweh, so it would be appropriate to describe Yahweh as the one who **sent**. Alternate translation: [Yahweh sent these soldiers into a valley under Barak’s command] or [Yahweh sent Barak into a valley to fight against chariots on foot]
5:15	j194		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	בִּ⁠פְלַגּ֣וֹת רְאוּבֵ֔ן	1	The word translated as **divisions** is a rare word whose meaning is not entirely clear in this context. It could mean: (1) divisions of the people of the tribe of Reuben. Alternate translation: [Among the clans of Reuben]; (2) divisions of the territory of the tribe of Reuben. Alternate translation: [Throughout the districts of Reuben]
5:15	sdi1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	גְּדֹלִ֖ים חִקְקֵי־לֵֽב	1	Here the **heart** represents the thoughts and intentions. By using the word translated as **searchings**, the song is speaking as if the people of Reuben needed to look around inside their hearts to find out what they should do. That is also a rare word whose meaning is not entirely clear in this context. This could mean: (1) that the people of Reuben could not decide whether to help fight. Your language may have a comparable expression for this meaning that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: [people had second thoughts about whether to fight]; (2) that the people of Reuben publicly expressed a resolve to help fight Sisera but, as the next verse shows, they did not follow through. Alternate translation: [great were the promises to help]
5:16	j195		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	לָ֣⁠מָּה יָשַׁ֗בְתָּ בֵּ֚ין הַֽ⁠מִּשְׁפְּתַ֔יִם לִ⁠שְׁמֹ֖עַ שְׁרִק֣וֹת עֲדָרִ֑ים	1	The song is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [You should not have stayed among the sheepfolds, as if it was more important to listen to the piping for the flocks!]
5:16	j196		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe	לָ֣⁠מָּה יָשַׁ֗בְתָּ בֵּ֚ין הַֽ⁠מִּשְׁפְּתַ֔יִם לִ⁠שְׁמֹ֖עַ שְׁרִק֣וֹת עֲדָרִ֑ים	1	The song is speaking to someone who is not present. It is doing this to express a strong feeling about that person to the people who are present. If a speaker of your language would not address someone who was not present, you could translate this as if the song were directly addressing those who are present. Alternate translation: [Reuben should not have stayed among the sheepfolds, as if it were more important to listen to the piping for the flocks]
5:16	j197		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	לָ֣⁠מָּה יָשַׁ֗בְתָּ בֵּ֚ין הַֽ⁠מִּשְׁפְּתַ֔יִם	1	The word **you** is singular here because the song is addressing this tribe as if it were a single person, its ancestor Reuben. It may be more natural in some languages to use a plural form of “you,” since a group of people is actually being addressed.
5:16	j198		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לִ⁠שְׁמֹ֖עַ שְׁרִק֣וֹת עֲדָרִ֑ים	1	The song is implicitly making a comparison that it expects listeners to recognize. When Barak summoned the Israelites in [4:10](../04/10.md), it is likely that he blew a shofar (ram’s horn), as Ehud did in [3:27](../03/27.md). The song is suggesting that the men of Reuben so much enjoyed listening to shepherds play their pipes to summon their flocks that they did not pay attention to the war trumpet. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [Was it because you would rather listen to shepherd’s pipes than respond to the call of the war trumpet?]
5:16	jg14		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לִ⁠פְלַגּ֣וֹת רְאוּבֵ֔ן גְּדוֹלִ֖ים חִקְרֵי־לֵֽב	1	See how you translated the similar expression in the previous verse.
5:17	pg1n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	גִּלְעָ֗ד	1	The song is using the name **Gilead** by association to mean the soldiers from the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh, which settled in the region of Gilead on the east side of the Jordan River. Alternate translation: [The soldiers of Reuben, Gad, and Manasseh]
5:17	wy1c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	וְ⁠דָ֕ן לָ֥⁠מָּה יָג֖וּר אֳנִיּ֑וֹת	1	The song is using the present tense to describe habitual action. During the battle against Sisera, the people of the tribe of Dan continued to do what they usually did. Their territory included the harbor of Joppa, and so they were devoted to the pursuits of fishing and maritime trading. But since the song is referring specifically to what the people of Dan did on a specific occasion, you could use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: [and Dan, why did he sojourn on ships]
5:17	l6vz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וְ⁠דָ֕ן לָ֥⁠מָּה יָג֖וּר אֳנִיּ֑וֹת	1	The song is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [and Dan should not have sojourned on ships!]
5:18	j199		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	זְבֻל֗וּן עַ֣ם חֵרֵ֥ף נַפְשׁ֛⁠וֹ לָ⁠מ֖וּת	1	Since the song is referring to a group of people, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **soul**. Alternate translation: [The people of Zebulun were reproaching their souls unto death]
5:18	j200		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	זְבֻל֗וּן עַ֣ם חֵרֵ֥ף נַפְשׁ֛⁠וֹ לָ⁠מ֖וּת	1	The song is speaking as if the people of the tribe of Zebulun had literally been **reproaching** their souls during the battle, that is, as if they had been taunting or shaming them for wanting to stay alive. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [The people of Zebulun told themselves not to be afraid to die]
5:18	j201		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠נַפְתָּלִ֑י עַ֖ל מְרוֹמֵ֥י שָׂדֶֽה	1	The song is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: [and the people of Naphtali were also not afraid to die on the heights on the battlefield]
5:19	j202		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בָּ֤אוּ מְלָכִים֙ נִלְחָ֔מוּ אָ֤ז נִלְחֲמוּ֙ מַלְכֵ֣י כְנַ֔עַן	1	Chapter 4 describes only Jabin oppressing the Israelites and only his army attacking Barak and his forces. However, it also describes Jabin as the “king of Canaan” ([4:2](../04/02.md)), suggesting that other Canaanite kings were his subjects or allies. The song may be referring to such kings implicitly here. Alternate translation: [Then the armies of Jabin and his Canaanite allies came and fought]
5:19	klr4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	בָּ֤אוּ מְלָכִים֙ & מַלְכֵ֣י כְנַ֔עַן	1	The song is using the term **kings** to refer to them and their armies. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [Kings came with their armies … the armies of the kings of Canaan]
5:19	qh9s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	נִלְחָ֔מוּ & נִלְחֲמוּ֙ מַלְכֵ֣י כְנַ֔עַן	1	The song is leaving some information implicit that it assumes readers will understand. The meaning is not that these kings **fought** with each other, but that they fought against the Israelites. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [they fought against us Israelites … the kings of Canaan fought against us]
5:19	bwx4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	בְּ⁠תַעְנַ֖ךְ & מְגִדּ֑וֹ	1	See how you translated the names of the cities of **Taanach** and **Megiddo** in [1:27](../01/27.md).
5:19	j203		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מֵ֣י מְגִדּ֑וֹ	1	Here the song is referring to the Kishon River as **the waters of Megiddo** by association with the fact that the river flows through the plain of Megiddo, also known as the valley of Jezreel, where the battle against Sisera was fought. You could use the name Kishon River here if that would help your readers to recognize that the song is describing the same **waters** as in [5:21](../05/21.md). Alternate translation: [the Kishon River]
5:19	jn5l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	בֶּ֥צַע כֶּ֖סֶף לֹ֥א לָקָֽחוּ	1	The song is using **silver**, one thing that armies might take as **plunder**, to mean plunder of all kinds. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [But they did not take any plunder]
5:19	j204		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בֶּ֥צַע כֶּ֖סֶף לֹ֥א לָקָֽחוּ	1	The song is using taking plunder to mean winning the battle, by association with the way that victorious armies take plunder. Alternate translation: [But they did not win the battle]
5:20	uwf8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	מִן־שָׁמַ֖יִם נִלְחָ֑מוּ הַ⁠כּֽוֹכָבִים֙ מִ⁠מְּסִלּוֹתָ֔⁠ם נִלְחֲמ֖וּ עִם־סִיסְרָֽא	1	The song is speaking of the **stars** as if they were living things that could have **fought against Sisera**. It is using the stars to represent the forces of nature, particularly those in the sky, and celebrating the way Yahweh used those forces to defeat Sisera. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [Yahweh used the forces of nature to defeat Sisera; he sent a great storm from the sky]
5:21	yn1b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	גְּרָפָ֔⁠ם	1	The pronoun **them** refers to the soldiers in Sisera’s army. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: [swept away Sisera’s soldiers]
5:21	j205		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	נַ֥חַל קְדוּמִ֖ים	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **antiquity**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [that ancient wadi]
5:21	j206		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	נַ֥חַל קְדוּמִ֖ים	1	The implicit idea behind this phrase may be that the Kishon is a natural river, part of the original creation, rather than a manmade canal or irrigation channel. Therefore, like the storm, it was a natural force that Yahweh used to defeat Sisera. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [a river that God created]
5:21	je12		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	תִּדְרְכִ֥י נַפְשִׁ֖⁠י עֹֽז	1	The singer, who is probably Barak at this point (see the Introduction to this chapter), is using one part of himself, his **soul**, to mean all of himself. He is putting himself back in the time of the battle and encouraging himself to fight vigorously since Yahweh is already defeating Sisera with natural forces. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly, and you could express it from the time perspective of the victory celebration, that is, as a past event, as in the first sentence of the verse. Alternate translation: [When I saw this, it encouraged me to fight vigorously]
5:22	wx9v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אָ֥ז הָלְמ֖וּ עִקְּבֵי־ס֑וּס מִֽ⁠דַּהֲר֖וֹת דַּהֲר֥וֹת אַבִּירָֽי⁠ו	1	The pronoun **his** refers to Sisera. This is a description of the sound of Sisera’s horses fleeing from the battle. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: [Then there was the sound of horses’ hooves beating, as Sisera’s mighty steeds galloped away from the battlefield]
5:22	j207		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	הָלְמ֖וּ עִקְּבֵי־ס֑וּס	1	Since the song is referring to all of Sisera’s horses, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **horse**. Alternate translation: [the hooves of horses beat]
5:22	n754		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	מִֽ⁠דַּהֲר֖וֹת דַּהֲר֥וֹת אַבִּירָֽי⁠ו	1	The author is repeating the verb **galloping** in order to intensify the idea that it expresses and perhaps to imitate the repetitive sound of horses’ hooves beating against the ground. If your language can repeat words for intensification and poetic effect, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: [as Sisera’s mighty steeds galloped wildly away]
5:22	j208		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	אַבִּירָֽי⁠ו	1	The song is using the adjective **mighty** as a noun to mean a horse that has the characteristic of being mighty. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this adjective with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: [his mighty steeds]
5:23	j209		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	א֣וֹרוּ מֵר֗וֹז אָמַר֙ מַלְאַ֣ךְ יְהוָ֔ה אֹ֥רוּ אָר֖וֹר יֹשְׁבֶ֑י⁠הָ כִּ֤י לֹֽא־בָ֨אוּ֙ לְ⁠עֶזְרַ֣ת יְהוָ֔ה לְ⁠עֶזְרַ֥ת יְהוָ֖ה בַּ⁠גִּבּוֹרִֽים	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: [The angel of Yahweh said that we must certainly curse the people who lived in Meroz, because they did not come to the aid of Yahweh against the warriors]
5:23	cdl6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	מֵר֗וֹז	1	The word **Meroz** is the name of a town. It was probably along the route that Sisera’s army took when fleeing from the battlefield, and the people of the town could have blocked their way so that the Israelites could have kept many more of the enemy soldiers from escaping.
5:23	k271		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מַלְאַ֣ךְ יְהוָ֔ה	1	See the discussion of this phrase in the Introduction to Judges, and see how you translated the same phrase in [2:1](../02/01.md). Translate it here as you do in other parts of the book, even though there is no further information here about how or when the **angel of Yahweh** appeared on this occasion.
5:23	j211		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	אֹ֥רוּ אָר֖וֹר יֹשְׁבֶ֑י⁠הָ כִּ֤י לֹֽא־בָ֨אוּ֙ לְ⁠עֶזְרַ֣ת יְהוָ֔ה לְ⁠עֶזְרַ֥ת יְהוָ֖ה בַּ⁠גִּבּוֹרִֽים	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: [Because they did not come to the aid of Yahweh, to the aid of Yahweh against the warriors, cursing, you shall curse the dwellers of it]
5:23	j210		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	אֹ֥רוּ אָר֖וֹר	1	The song is repeating forms of the verb **curse** in order to intensify the idea that it expresses. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: [You must certainly curse]
5:23	j212		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	לֹֽא־בָ֨אוּ֙ לְ⁠עֶזְרַ֣ת יְהוָ֔ה לְ⁠עֶזְרַ֥ת יְהוָ֖ה בַּ⁠גִּבּוֹרִֽים	1	These two phrases are saying the same thing. The second phrase emphasizes the meaning of the first by being more specific. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and you could show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation. However, if it would be clearer in your language, you could combine the phrases and express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: [they did not help Yahweh at all against the warriors]
5:24	j213		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	תְּבֹרַךְ֙ מִ⁠נָּשִׁ֔ים יָעֵ֕ל אֵ֖שֶׁת חֶ֣בֶר הַ⁠קֵּינִ֑י מִ⁠נָּשִׁ֥ים בָּ⁠אֹ֖הֶל תְּבֹרָֽךְ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [May Yahweh bless Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, who lives in a tent, more than any other woman]
5:24	j214		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	תְּבֹרַךְ֙ מִ⁠נָּשִׁ֔ים	1	Here, **from women** is a common expression that means that Jael is the most **blessed** woman, that is, she is more blessed than any other woman. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [is more blessed than any other woman]
5:24	j215		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	תְּבֹרַךְ֙ מִ⁠נָּשִׁ֔ים & מִ⁠נָּשִׁ֥ים בָּ⁠אֹ֖הֶל תְּבֹרָֽךְ	1	These two phrases are saying the same thing. The second phrase emphasizes the meaning of the first by being more specific. (It is not qualifying the first phrase by specifying that this statement about Jael actually applies only to women who live in tents.) You could include both phrases in your translation. However, if it would be clearer in your language, you could combine the phrases and express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: [who lives in a tent, is the most blessed of all women]
5:24	bcul		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	בָּ⁠אֹ֖הֶל	1	The song is not referring to a specific **tent**. This expression refers to tents in general. Alternate translation: [who live in tents]
5:25	j216		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	מַ֥יִם שָׁאַ֖ל חָלָ֣ב נָתָ֑נָה	1	The pronoun **he** refers to Sisera, and the pronoun **she** refers to Jael. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: [Sisera requested water, Jael gave him milk]
5:25	j217		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	בְּ⁠סֵ֥פֶל אַדִּירִ֖ים הִקְרִ֥יבָה חֶמְאָֽה	1	Bringing more than Sisera asked for and bringing it in an elegant bowl was a symbolic action that suggested that Jael respected Sisera and wanted to honor him. This would have made Sisera less cautious and encouraged him to think that he could safely go to sleep. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: [to suggest that she respected and honored him, she brought curdled milk in an elegant bowl]
5:25	viu5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	בְּ⁠סֵ֥פֶל אַדִּירִ֖ים	1	The song is using this possessive form to describe the kind of elegant **bowl** that wealthy **nobles** would have. This does not mean a bowl that contained nobles or a bowl that actually belonged to nobles. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: [in a bowl fit for nobles] or [in an elegant bowl]
5:26	k8d2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	תִּשְׁלַ֔חְנָה	1	The pronoun **They** refers to Jael’s hands. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: [Her hands reached out]
5:26	j232		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	תִּשְׁלַ֔חְנָה	1	The song is speaking of Jael’s hands as if they were living things that could have **reached out** by themselves. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [She reached out with her hands]
5:26	j235		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יָדָ⁠הּ֙	1	The context indicates that the word **hand** here means Jael’s left hand. Alternate translation: [her left hand]
5:26	j218		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	מָחֲקָ֣ה רֹאשׁ֔⁠וֹ וּ⁠מָחֲצָ֥ה וְ⁠חָלְפָ֖ה רַקָּתֽ⁠וֹ	1	These two phrases are saying the same thing. The second phrase emphasizes the meaning of the first by being more specific. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine the phrases and express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: [she drove the peg right through his temple and smashed his head]
5:27	j219		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בֵּ֣ין רַגְלֶ֔י⁠הָ כָּרַ֥ע	1	Since Sisera was lying down asleep when Jael pounded the tent peg through his head, it does not seem that he literally **bowed** down to her from a standing position. Rather, the song seems to be saying that when Jael stood astride his dead body, it was as if Sisera had prostrated himself before her, the way people in this culture did to show great honor to someone. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [It was as if Sisera had been prostrating himself before Jael]
5:27	j220		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	נָפַ֖ל שָׁכָ֑ב	1	Since Sisera was lying down, it also does not seem that he **fell** or **lay down** from a standing position. The song seems to be using the word **fell** to mean “died,” as in [4:16](../04/16.md), and the expression **lay down** to mean “died” as well. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [he died, he surely died]
5:27	j221		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	בֵּ֤ין רַגְלֶ֨י⁠הָ֙ כָּרַ֣ע נָפָ֔ל בַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֣ר כָּרַ֔ע שָׁ֖ם נָפַ֥ל שָׁדֽוּד	1	For emphasis, these two clauses repeat the idea of the first clause and last clause adds some specific information. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these clauses and express the emphasis in another way. The UST models one way to do this.
5:27	ezv3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	שָׁדֽוּד	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here and replace the comma before it with a period. Alternate translation: [She had destroyed him]
5:28	j222		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	מַדּ֗וּעַ בֹּשֵׁ֤שׁ רִכְבּ⁠וֹ֙ לָ⁠ב֔וֹא מַדּ֣וּעַ אֶֽחֱר֔וּ פַּעֲמֵ֖י מַרְכְּבוֹתָֽי⁠ו	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: [She asked why his chariot had delayed to come and why the hoofbeats of his chariots were tarrying]
5:28	k2dy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מַדּ֗וּעַ בֹּשֵׁ֤שׁ רִכְבּ⁠וֹ֙ לָ⁠ב֔וֹא מַדּ֣וּעַ אֶֽחֱר֔וּ פַּעֲמֵ֖י מַרְכְּבוֹתָֽי⁠ו	1	Sisera’s mother is using his **chariot** and these **hoofbeats** by association to mean Sisera himself. Alternate translation: [Why has he delayed to come back in his chariot? Why do I not hear the sound of the hoofbeats of his chariot horses indicating his arrival?]
5:28	mw4d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	מַדּ֗וּעַ בֹּשֵׁ֤שׁ רִכְבּ⁠וֹ֙ לָ⁠ב֔וֹא מַדּ֣וּעַ אֶֽחֱר֔וּ פַּעֲמֵ֖י מַרְכְּבוֹתָֽי⁠ו	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine them. Alternate translation: [Why is it taking so long for him to come back with his chariots?]
5:28	j223		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מַדּ֣וּעַ אֶֽחֱר֔וּ פַּעֲמֵ֖י מַרְכְּבוֹתָֽי⁠ו	1	Sisera’s mother is using the phrase **the hoofbeats of his chariots** by association to mean the sound of the hoofbeats of the horses that pull Sisera’s chariots. Alternate translation: [Why do I not yet hear the sound of the hoofbeats of the horses that pull his chariots?]
5:29	xa2n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	חַכְמ֥וֹת שָׂרוֹתֶ֖י⁠הָ	1	The song is using the adjective **wise** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: [Her wisest princesses]
5:29	mw32		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אַף־הִ֕יא תָּשִׁ֥יב אֲמָרֶ֖י⁠הָ לָֽ⁠הּ	1	This is a common expression that means that Sisera’s mother answered her own question. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [she also answered her own question]
5:30	j224		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	הֲ⁠לֹ֨א יִמְצְא֜וּ יְחַלְּק֣וּ שָׁלָ֗ל רַ֤חַם רַחֲמָתַ֨יִם֙ לְ⁠רֹ֣אשׁ גֶּ֔בֶר שְׁלַ֤ל צְבָעִים֙ לְ⁠סִ֣יסְרָ֔א שְׁלַ֥ל צְבָעִ֖ים רִקְמָ֑ה צֶ֥בַע רִקְמָתַ֖יִם לְ⁠צַוְּארֵ֥י שָׁלָֽל	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. It may be helpful to make this more than one sentence. Alternate translation: [She told herself that Sisera and his soldiers must be searching the battlefield for plunder and dividing it up. Each soldier, she thought, must be claiming a woman or two as concubines. She also thought that the soldiers must each be finding one or two dyed, embroidered robes that they could wear]
5:30	l98i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠לֹ֨א יִמְצְא֜וּ יְחַלְּק֣וּ שָׁלָ֗ל	1	Sisera’s mother is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [Certainly they are finding and dividing spoil]
5:30	j225		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	לְ⁠רֹ֣אשׁ גֶּ֔בֶר	1	This expression uses one part of a **warrior**, his **head**, to mean the warrior himself. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [for each warrior]
5:30	j226		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לְ⁠סִ֣יסְרָ֔א	1	Sisera’s mother is probably using the name **Sisera** by association to mean the soldiers in his army. She is probably not saying that only one or two expensive robes will be found among all the plunder and that Sisera personally will get those. Alternate translation: [for Sisera’s soldiers]
5:30	p9nz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	צְבָעִ֖ים רִקְמָ֑ה	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words implicitly connected with **and**. The word **embroidery** indicates how these **dyed fabrics** have been made even more luxurious. Alternate translation: [embroidered dyed fabrics]
5:30	j228		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	לְ⁠צַוְּארֵ֥י שָׁלָֽל	1	Sisera’s mother is using one part of these soldiers, their **necks**, to mean the soldiers themselves. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [for the soldiers to wear who are collecting this plunder]
5:30	j227		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לְ⁠צַוְּארֵ֥י שָׁלָֽל	1	Sisera’s mother is using the term **spoil** by association to mean the soldiers who are collecting this plunder after the battle. Alternate translation: [for the necks of the soldiers collecting this plunder]
5:31	j229		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	וְ⁠אֹ֣הֲבָ֔י⁠ו	1	The song is speaking about Yahweh in the third person after addressing him in the second person. It may be more natural in your language to translate this phrase in the second person as well. Alternate translation: [But may those who love you be]
5:31	bi4x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כְּ⁠צֵ֥את הַ⁠שֶּׁ֖מֶשׁ בִּ⁠גְבֻרָת֑⁠וֹ	1	The **strength** of the sun could be its brightness or its heat. So the point of this comparison may be that just as the sun, once it rises, is too bright to look at or so hot that people must get out of its rays into the shade, so no one will be able to resist those who love Yahweh. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: [irresistibly strong, like the unbearable brightness of the risen sun] or [irresistibly strong, like the unbearable heat of the risen sun]
5:31	j230		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	כְּ⁠צֵ֥את הַ⁠שֶּׁ֖מֶשׁ בִּ⁠גְבֻרָת֑⁠וֹ	1	This is the end of the song that Deborah and Barak sang. (In the next sentence, the author resumes the story.) If you began the song with an opening first-level quotation mark or similar opening convention, indicate its ending here with a closing first-level quotation mark or similar closing convention. If you have been using special formatting to set off the song as poetry, resume regular formatting with the next sentence.

6:3	j236		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וְ⁠הָיָ֖ה	1	The author is using this phrase to introduce background information that will help readers understand what happens in the story. In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
6:3	j237		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	אִם־זָרַ֣ע יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל	1	The author is using one part of the process of growing crops, sowing seed, to mean the whole process. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [as the Israelites tried to grow crops each year]
6:3	vao0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וּ⁠בְנֵי־קֶ֖דֶם	1	In certain contexts, the biblical text uses the expression **sons of** to indicate that the members of a group share the quality of something. In this case, they share the quality of living to the **east** of the Israelites. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [and the inhabitants of the land to the east of Israel]
6:3	j238		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	עָלָֽי⁠ו	1	The pronoun **him** refers to **Israel**. The author is speaking of the nation as if it were a person. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: [to oppress the people of Israel]
6:5	ra2i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	וְ⁠לָ⁠הֶ֥ם וְ⁠לִ⁠גְמַלֵּי⁠הֶ֖ם אֵ֣ין מִסְפָּ֑ר	1	The author is making an overstatement for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the emphasis in a different way. Alternate translation: [Large numbers of people came, and they brought very many camels with them]
6:5	j239		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	וַ⁠יָּבֹ֥אוּ בָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ לְ⁠שַׁחֲתָֽ⁠הּ	1	The author is describing the result rather than the purpose of the Midianites coming into the land of Israel. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: [And as a result of them coming into the land, it was ruined]
6:6	j240		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וַ⁠יִּדַּ֧ל יִשְׂרָאֵ֛ל מְאֹ֖ד מִ⁠פְּנֵ֣י מִדְיָ֑ן	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [And the Midianites greatly impoverished the Israelites]
6:6	js0c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מִ⁠פְּנֵ֣י מִדְיָ֑ן	1	Here, **from the face of** is a common expression of the culture that means “because of” or “on account of.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [because of the Midianites]
6:7	j241		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֕י	1	The author is using this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event.
6:8	j242		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	אִ֥ישׁ נָבִ֖יא	1	The author is using the phrase **a man** to introduce this **prophet** as a new participant in the story. If your language has its own way of introducing new participants, you can use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: [a certain prophet]
6:8	j243		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	כֹּה־אָמַ֥ר יְהוָ֣ה ׀ אֱלֹהֵ֣י יִשְׂרָאֵ֗ל אָנֹכִ֞י הֶעֱלֵ֤יתִי אֶתְ⁠כֶם֙ מִ⁠מִּצְרַ֔יִם וָ⁠אֹצִ֥יא אֶתְ⁠כֶ֖ם מִ⁠בֵּ֥ית עֲבָדִֽים	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: [Yahweh, the God of Israel, says that he brought you up from Egypt and that he brought you out from the house of slaves]

To show that this is poetry, you may want to include both phrases in your translation. But it may be clearer in your language to connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: [I brought you up from Egypt, indeed, I brought you out from the house of slaves]
6:8	j245		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֶתְ⁠כֶם֙	1	Yahweh is saying **you** by association to mean “you Israelites.” He did not bring the people whom this prophet is addressing **up from Egypt**, since that happened in an earlier generation. Alternate translation: [you Israelites]

6:10	j246		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	וָ⁠אֹמְרָ֣⁠ה לָ⁠כֶ֗ם אֲנִי֙ יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹהֵי⁠כֶ֔ם לֹ֤א תִֽירְאוּ֙ אֶת־אֱלֹהֵ֣י הָ⁠אֱמֹרִ֔י אֲשֶׁ֥ר אַתֶּ֖ם יוֹשְׁבִ֣ים בְּ⁠אַרְצָ֑⁠ם וְ⁠לֹ֥א שְׁמַעְתֶּ֖ם בְּ⁠קוֹלִֽ⁠י	1	If you began translating this in the previous verse in such a way that there would not be a quotation within a quotation, you can continue to do that here. Alternate translation: [He says that he told you that he was Yahweh your God and that you were not to fear the gods of the Amorite when you were dwelling in their land, but you have not heard his voice]
6:10	j247		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠לֹ֥א שְׁמַעְתֶּ֖ם בְּ⁠קוֹלִֽ⁠י	1	See how you translated the same expression in [2:2](../02/02.md). Alternate translation: [But you have not obeyed my voice]
6:10	ne4s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠לֹ֥א שְׁמַעְתֶּ֖ם בְּ⁠קוֹלִֽ⁠י	1	Yahweh is using the term **voice** by association to mean what he used his voice to command them to do. Alternate translation: [But you have not obeyed what I commanded you]
6:11	sex8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יָּבֹ֞א מַלְאַ֣ךְ יְהוָ֗ה	1	The author is introducing a new event in the story. The ULT indicates this with the word **Now**. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event.
6:11	j248		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	מַלְאַ֣ךְ יְהוָ֗ה	1	See the discussion of this phrase in the Introduction to Judges, and see how you translated it in [2:1](../02/01.md).
6:11	r6sg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	בְּ⁠עָפְרָ֔ה & אֲבִ֣י הָֽעֶזְרִ֑י	1	The word **Ophrah** is the name of a town, and the word **Abiezrite** describes a person who belonged to the group of descendants of a man named Abiezer.
6:11	j249		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	וְ⁠גִדְע֣וֹן בְּנ֗⁠וֹ	1	The author is using this phrase to introduce **Gideon** as a new participant in the story. If your language has its own way of introducing new participants, you can use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: [And one of his sons, Gideon]
6:11	j250		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִ⁠פְּנֵ֥י מִדְיָֽן	1	Here, **to the face of** represents being in the presence of the Midianites. See the discussion of the term **to the face** in the Introduction to Judges. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [from the presence of Midian]
6:12	j251		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	יְהוָ֥ה עִמְּ⁠ךָ֖	1	Verses 14 and 16 identify this **angel** as Yahweh himself. So here Yahweh is actually speaking about himself in the third person. However, Gideon does not yet know that Yahweh is appearing to him in the form of this angel. So it would be appropriate to leave this statement in the third person.
6:12	j252		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	גִּבּ֥וֹר הֶ⁠חָֽיִל	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **valor**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [valiant warrior]
6:13	in9x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	בִּ֣י אֲדֹנִ֔⁠י וְ⁠יֵ֤שׁ יְהוָה֙ עִמָּ֔⁠נוּ וְ⁠לָ֥⁠מָּה מְצָאַ֖תְ⁠נוּ כָּל־זֹ֑את וְ⁠אַיֵּ֣ה כָֽל־נִפְלְאֹתָ֡י⁠ו אֲשֶׁר֩ סִפְּרוּ־לָ֨⁠נוּ אֲבוֹתֵ֜י⁠נוּ לֵ⁠אמֹ֗ר הֲ⁠לֹ֤א מִ⁠מִּצְרַ֨יִם֙ הֶעֱלָ֣⁠נוּ יְהוָ֔ה	1	Gideon and the ancestors whom he is quoting are using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: [Excuse me, my lord, but if Yahweh is with us, then all of this should not have happened to us! We should be seeing the same kind of wonders that our fathers recounted to us, saying, ‘Yahweh brought us up from Egypt!]
6:13	as35		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	בִּ֣י אֲדֹנִ֔⁠י	1	Gideon is politely asking permission to address a superior and referring to the angel by a respectful title. In your translation, use comparable forms for these purposes in your own language.
6:13	j253		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	עִמָּ֔⁠נוּ & מְצָאַ֖תְ⁠נוּ & לָ֨⁠נוּ & הֶעֱלָ֣⁠נוּ & וַֽ⁠יִּתְּנֵ֖⁠נוּ	1	In each of these instances, by **us**, Gideon means himself and others in his situation but not the angel of Yahweh, to whom he is speaking. So use the exclusive form of that word in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
6:13	j254		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֲבוֹתֵ֜י⁠נוּ	1	Gideon is using the term **fathers** to mean “ancestors.” If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [our ancestors]
6:13	j255		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	לֵ⁠אמֹ֗ר הֲ⁠לֹ֤א מִ⁠מִּצְרַ֨יִם֙ הֶעֱלָ֣⁠נוּ יְהוָ֔ה	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: [when they told us how Yahweh brought us up from Egypt]
6:13	e2k9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַֽ⁠יִּתְּנֵ֖⁠נוּ בְּ⁠כַף־מִדְיָֽן	1	Here the term **palm**, like the term “hand” elsewhere in the book, represents the power of a person or group. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [and given the Midianites power over us]
6:14	kx2t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִ⁠כַּ֣ף מִדְיָ֑ן	1	See how you translated the similar expression in the previous verse. Alternate translation: [from the power of Midian]
6:14	zs9h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠לֹ֖א שְׁלַחְתִּֽי⁠ךָ	1	Yahweh is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [I am sending you!]
6:15	w5e8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	בִּ֣י אֲדֹנָ֔⁠י	1	See how you translated this same phrase in [6:13](../06/13.md).
6:15	wn75		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	בַּ⁠מָּ֥ה אוֹשִׁ֖יעַ אֶת־יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל	1	Gideon seems to be using the question form for emphasis rather than to ask for information, since in the rest of the verse he gives reasons why he cannot do what Yahweh is telling him to do. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [there is no means by which I can save Israel!]
6:15	t5kr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הִנֵּ֤ה	1	As the Introduction to Judges discusses, Gideon is using the word **Behold** to call attention to what he is about to say. Alternate translation: [Listen]
6:15	gpv8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers	אַלְפִּ⁠י֙	1	Here the term **thousand** probably refers not to that number of people but to a part of a tribe. Alternate translation, as in the UST: [my clan]
6:15	gp6c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	הַ⁠דַּ֣ל בִּ⁠מְנַשֶּׁ֔ה וְ⁠אָנֹכִ֥י הַ⁠צָּעִ֖יר	1	Gideon is using the adjectives **weak** and **young** as nouns. The ULT shows this by adding the word **one** in each case. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate these adjectives with equivalent phrases. Alternate translation: [is the weakest clan in Manasseh, and I am the youngest son]
6:16	p1xa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	כִּ֥י אֶהְיֶ֖ה עִמָּ֑⁠ךְ	1	Yahweh is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Yahweh is implicitly answering Gideon’s question in the previous verse. Alternate translation: [You will be able to save Israel because I will be with you]
6:16	fhe8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אֶת־מִדְיָ֖ן כְּ⁠אִ֥ישׁ אֶחָֽד	1	This is a common expression that refers to an entire group gathered together, as the similar uses in [20:1](../20/01.md), [20:8](../20/08.md), [20:11](../20/11.md), and [Nehemiah 8:1](../../neh/08/01.md) show. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [the entire army of Midian at once]
6:17	j256		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אִם & מָצָ֥אתִי חֵ֖ן בְּ⁠עֵינֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1	Gideon is not using the word **found** to mean that he was intentionally searching for something. He is using it to refer to having something, as if he had found it. Alternate translation: [if in fact I have favor in your eyes]
6:17	j257		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	אִם & מָצָ֥אתִי חֵ֖ן בְּ⁠עֵינֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **favor**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [if in fact you have judged me favorably]
6:17	xzdd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בְּ⁠עֵינֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1	See the discussion of the expression “in the eyes of” in the Introduction to Judges. See how you translated the same expression in [2:11](../02/11.md). Alternate translation: [in your judgment]
6:19	j258		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	גְּדִֽי־עִזִּים֙	1	This is a common expression that describes a young goat. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [a young goat]
6:19	kmz6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bvolume	וְ⁠אֵיפַת־קֶ֣מַח	1	If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express this amount in terms of modern measurements. Alternate translation: [and from about 22 liters of flour] or [and from about 20 pounds of flour]
6:20	u9cs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	מַלְאַ֣ךְ הָ⁠אֱלֹהִ֗ים	1	The phrase **the angel of God** refers to the same person as “the angel of Yahweh.” It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers by using the same expression that you have been using to translate “the angel of Yahweh.”
6:21	j259		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	וַ⁠תַּ֨עַל הָ⁠אֵ֜שׁ	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “went” instead of **came**. Alternate translation: [and fire went up]
6:21	j260		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מֵ⁠עֵינָֽי⁠ו	1	The author is using the term **eyes** by association to mean sight. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [out of his sight]
6:22	x6iw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יַּ֣רְא גִּדְע֔וֹן	1	The author is using the term **saw** by association to mean “recognized.” Alternate translation: [And Gideon recognized]
6:22	j261		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	אֲהָהּ֙ אֲדֹנָ֣⁠י יְהוִ֔ה כִּֽי־עַל־כֵּ֤ן רָאִ֨יתִי֙ מַלְאַ֣ךְ יְהוָ֔ה פָּנִ֖ים אֶל־פָּנִֽים	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: [Since I have seen the angel of Yahweh face to face, I am afraid that you, Lord Yahweh, are going to punish me]
6:22	l2pp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	אֲהָהּ֙ אֲדֹנָ֣⁠י יְהוִ֔ה	1	Gideon is using a word that expresses a strong feeling, fear. The ULT translates this word as **Alas**. There may be an equivalent word or expression in your language that you can use in your translation to convey this strong feeling. If not, you could specify that Gideon said this because he was feeling fear. Alternate translation: [Oh, no, my Lord Yahweh] or [I am afraid, my Lord Yahweh]
6:22	c1kt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	פָּנִ֖ים אֶל־פָּנִֽים	1	This is a common expression that describes seeing someone in person. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. (For example, some languages may say something such as “nose to nose.”) You could also state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation, as in the UST: [in person]
6:23	b3ha		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר ל֧⁠וֹ יְהוָ֛ה	1	Since the angel of Yahweh had disappeared from Gideon’s sight, the author seems to mean implicitly that Yahweh spoke to Gideon from heaven. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [But Yahweh spoke to him from heaven and said]
6:23	j262		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	שָׁל֥וֹם לְ⁠ךָ֖	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **Peace**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [Everything is peaceful between you and me]
6:24	j263		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	יְהוָ֖ה שָׁל֑וֹם	1	Even if your language would not ordinarily use an abstract noun for the idea of **Peace**, you may be able to use that word in the name of this altar. If not, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [Yahweh Makes Us Peaceful]
6:24	s81y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	עַ֚ד הַ⁠יּ֣וֹם הַ⁠זֶּ֔ה	1	The author is using the term **day** to refer to a specific time, the time when he was writing the book of Judges. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [At this time]
6:25	j264		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִי֮	1	The author is using this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event.
6:25	j265		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אֶת־פַּר־הַ⁠שּׁוֹר֙	1	This is a common expression that describes a young ox. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. See how you translated the comparable expression “a kid of goats” in [6:19](../06/19.md). Alternate translation: [the young ox]
6:25	j266		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	וּ⁠פַ֥ר הַ⁠שֵּׁנִ֖י שֶׁ֣בַע שָׁנִ֑ים	1	If your language does not use this type of number, you could use a different type of number here or an equivalent expression. Alternate translation: [and his other bullock, the one that is seven years old]
6:26	tj4p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עַ֣ל רֹ֧אשׁ הַ⁠מָּע֛וֹז הַ⁠זֶּ֖ה	1	Yahweh assumes that Gideon will understand that by **the head of this stronghold**, he is referring to the top of a rocky cliff in the town of Ophrah. The people of the town could go there for safety from the Midianites, and since it was a high place, it was also where Gideon’s father had built an altar. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [on the high place near this town]
6:26	gvr9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בַּ⁠מַּֽעֲרָכָ֑ה	1	This phrase probably refers to Yahweh’s command to the Israelites in [Exodus 20:25](../../exo/20/25.md) to use only natural stones if they built a stone altar to him. That is, they were not to use any stones that had been cut or shaped with tools. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [in the proper arrangement] or [using only natural stones, as I have commanded]
6:26	j267		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וְ⁠לָֽקַחְתָּ֙ אֶת־הַ⁠פָּ֣ר הַ⁠שֵּׁנִ֔י וְ⁠הַעֲלִ֣יתָ עוֹלָ֔ה	1	As the previous verse describes, this **second bull** was seven years old. This was symbolic of the seven years during which God had punished the Israelites for their disobedience, as [6:1](../06/01.md) describes. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: [Then you shall take the seven-year-old bull and you shall offer an offering for the sins of the Israelites]
6:26	j268		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בַּ⁠עֲצֵ֥י הָ⁠אֲשֵׁרָ֖ה	1	Yahweh is using the term **wood** by association to mean a fire that Gideon would build using this wood as fuel. Alternate translation: [on a fire that you shall build from the wood of the Asherah]
6:27	j269		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֶת־בֵּ֨ית אָבִ֜י⁠ו	1	The author is using the term **house** by association to mean a group of people who were living together, not necessarily all in the same building. Gideon’s **father** was the head of this household, which probably included family members in several generations and servants. Alternate translation: [the people in his extended family]
6:27	j270		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	וְ⁠אֶת־אַנְשֵׁ֥י הָ⁠עִ֛יר	1	Here the masculine term **men** has a generic sense that includes both men and women. While the males in the city were the most likely to attack Gideon for tearing down the altar of Baal, he probably feared any person—man or woman, adult or child—who would recognize him and identify him as the person who had done that. Alternate translation: [and the people of the city]
6:28	i5zb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠הִנֵּ֤ה נֻתַּץ֙ מִזְבַּ֣ח הַ⁠בַּ֔עַל וְ⁠הָ⁠אֲשֵׁרָ֥ה אֲשֶׁר־עָלָ֖י⁠ו כֹּרָ֑תָה וְ⁠אֵת֙ הַ⁠פָּ֣ר הַ⁠שֵּׁנִ֔י הֹֽעֲלָ֔ה עַל־הַ⁠מִּזְבֵּ֖חַ הַ⁠בָּנֽוּי	1	If your language does not use these passive forms, you could express these ideas with active forms or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [and they saw that someone had torn down the altar of Baal, cut down the Asherah that was beside it, built an altar, and offered the second bullock on it]
6:29	j272		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יֹּֽאמְרוּ֙ אִ֣ישׁ אֶל־רֵעֵ֔⁠הוּ	1	This is a common expression that means that the people of the city were asking each other the question that follows. No particular relationship is in view between a **man** and his **fellow** man. The expression just means that one person asked another. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [Each person was asking other people]
6:29	j273		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	וַֽ⁠יִּדְרְשׁוּ֙ וַ⁠יְבַקְשׁ֔וּ וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמְר֔וּ	1	The terms **searched** and **sought** mean similar things. The author is using the two terms together for emphasis, probably to mean that it took some time to find out who was responsible. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: [They had to search for some time, but finally they discovered]
6:30	j274		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	הוֹצֵ֥א אֶת־בִּנְ⁠ךָ֖ וְ⁠יָמֹ֑ת כִּ֤י נָתַץ֙ אֶת־מִזְבַּ֣ח הַ⁠בַּ֔עַל וְ⁠כִ֥י כָרַ֖ת הָ⁠אֲשֵׁרָ֥ה אֲשֶׁר־עָלָֽי⁠ו	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: [Because your son tore down the altar of Baal and cut down the Asherah that was beside it, he deserves to die, so bring him out to us]
6:30	r7h5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠יָמֹ֑ת	1	The men of the city mean implicitly that they want Joash to surrender Gideon to them so that they can execute him as a punishment. They do not mean that Gideon would die as a result of Joash bringing him out. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [so that we can execute him]
6:31	j275		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אֲשֶׁר־עָמְד֨וּ עָלָ֜י⁠ו	1	This is a common expression that describes these people opposing Joash in an argument. The emphasis is not on their body position, although they likely were standing around his house. The idea is that they wanted Joash to bring Gideon out to them, but he refused, so the people were in opposition **against** Joash. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [who were arguing with him]
6:31	jw4v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הַ⁠אַתֶּ֣ם ׀ תְּרִיב֣וּ⁠ן לַ⁠בַּ֗עַל אִם־אַתֶּם֙ תּוֹשִׁיע֣וּ⁠ן אוֹת֔⁠וֹ	1	Joash is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: [You should not have to contend for Baal! You should not have to help him!]
6:31	j276		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֲשֶׁ֨ר יָרִ֥יב ל֛⁠וֹ יוּמַ֖ת	1	Joash is saying implicitly that anyone who thinks he needs to act to defend Baal’s honor is suggesting that Baal is not powerful enough to defend his own honor, and that is being just as disrespectful to Baal as the person who tore down his altar. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [Whoever contends for him is being just as disrespectful, and he is the one who deserves to die]
6:31	j277		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	עַד־הַ⁠בֹּ֑קֶר	1	Joash is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: [while it is still morning]
6:32	j4wi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	יְרֻבַּ֣עַל	1	The word **Jerubbaal** is another name by which Gideon became known. It means “may Baal contend.”
6:32	q44c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotemarks	לֵ⁠אמֹ֑ר יָ֤רֶב בּ⁠וֹ֙ הַ⁠בַּ֔עַל כִּ֥י נָתַ֖ץ אֶֽת־מִזְבְּחֽ⁠וֹ	1	It is unclear how many of the words that follow **saying** were spoken by the people who gave Gideon the name **Jerubbaal** and how many are an explanation by the author of why the people gave him this name. The people could have spoken: (1) all of the words that are within quotation marks in the ULT. This would be a repetition of what Joash said at the end of the previous verse. (2) only the first phrase that is within quotation marks in the ULT. This would explain the meaning of the name Jerubbaal. The rest would be an explanation by the author. Alternate translation: [saying, “May Baal contend against him,” since he tore down his altar]
6:33	ual5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וְ⁠כָל־מִדְיָ֧ן וַ⁠עֲמָלֵ֛ק וּ⁠בְנֵי־קֶ֖דֶם נֶאֶסְפ֣וּ יַחְדָּ֑ו	1	The author is introducing a new event in the story. The ULT indicates this with the word **Now**. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event.
6:33	aujx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וּ⁠בְנֵי־קֶ֖דֶם	1	See how you translated this expression in [6:3](../06/03.md).
6:33	eu5d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יַּעַבְר֥וּ	1	The author assumes that readers will understand that he means that these enemy forces **crossed over** the Jordan River into Israel. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [and they crossed over the Jordan River into Israel]
6:34	d9eb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠ר֣וּחַ יְהוָ֔ה לָבְשָׁ֖ה אֶת־גִּדְע֑וֹן	1	The author is speaking as if the **Spirit of Yahweh** literally **wore** Gideon as if he had been a garment. He means that the Spirit of Yahweh gave Gideon strength and guidance, as if Gideon had the Spirit right inside himself doing that. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. You could also state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [Then the Spirit of Yahweh filled Gideon] or [Then the Spirit of Yahweh made Gideon strong and confident]
6:34	mo2a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֲבִיעֶ֖זֶר	1	See the discussion in the Introduction to Judges of the author’s use of the name of a nation, tribe, or clan to mean its people or army. Alternate translation: [the Abiezrites]
6:35	sy9t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	ה֖וּא	1	The author is using the pronoun **him** in the first instance to speak of the tribe of **Manasseh** as if it were an individual person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [the soldiers from that tribe]
6:35	j278		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	וַֽ⁠יַּעֲל֖וּ לִ⁠קְרָאתָֽ⁠ם	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “came” instead of **went**. Alternate translation: [and they came up to meet them]
6:35	qb25		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַֽ⁠יַּעֲל֖וּ לִ⁠קְרָאתָֽ⁠ם	1	The pronoun **they** refers to the soldiers from the tribes of **Asher**, **Zebulun**, and **Naphtali** who responded to the summons from Gideon. The pronoun **them** could refer to: (1) Gideon and the soldiers from Manasseh whom he was commanding. This would suit the sense of the verb **went up**, since [7:9](../07/09.md) indicates that Gideon was staying on some high ground above the battlefield. Alternate translation: [and soldiers from those tribes went up to meet Gideon and the soldiers from Manasseh whom he was commanding]; (2) the enemy armies. Alternate translation: [and soldiers from those tribes joined in the fight against the Midianites and their allies]

In this culture, a fleece could be used as a blanket or to make a garment. If your readers would not be familiar with what a fleece is, in your translation you could use the name of a similar thing that your readers would recognize, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: [a sheepskin] or [an animal skin with the hair still on it]

7:intro	q545				0	# Judges 7 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nThe account of Gideon, which began in [chapter 6](../06/01.md), continues in this chapter.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Why does the barley loaf represent Gideon?\n\nIn [7:13](../07/13.md), a Midianite soldier tells his friend that the loaf of barley bread in the dream the friend has just recounted must represent Gideon. He says this because barley was a grain that only poorer people ate, and as [6:6](../06/06.md) states, the Midianites had reduced the Israelites to poverty. In [6:11](../06/11.md), Gideon was threshing wheat in a winepress to hide it from the Midianites; they may have taken the wheat from Israel but left the barley because they did not want to eat it. Beyond this, the “sons of the east” were nomadic herders, so they would have associated grain with a farming culture such as the Israelites had. For these reasons, the soldier recognizes that the loaf of barley bread represents the Israelite army under the command of Gideon. A note to [verse 13](../07/13.md) suggests a way to indicate this in your translation.\n\n### Mount Gilead\n\nIn [7:3](../07/03.md), Yahweh tells Gideon to announce to his troops that anyone who is afraid can depart from “Mount Gilead.” In this context, that name cannot refer, as it usually does, to the mountainous region east of the Jordan River. The Valley of Jezreel, where the two armies had gathered for battle, was west of the Jordan River. Since Gilead was the ancestor of a major part of the tribe of Manasseh, including the Abiezrites, and since that tribe had territory on both sides of the Jordan, it is possible that the people of Manasseh had named a mountain after Gilead on the west side of the river, near where Gideon’s army had assembled. But such a mountain is not known from any other source. Some commentators have suggested instead that “Mount Gilead” might have been a name that the soldiers of Manasseh gave to their army, to describe both its strength and its lineage. However, there is no evidence elsewhere for that either. But since this is ultimately a matter of interpretation rather than of translation, is probably best to translate the expression as “Mount Gilead” and allow preachers and teachers of the Bible to explain the possible meanings.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### “into their hand”/“into your hand” (plural “you”)\n\nIn several places in this chapter, the author or characters use the expressions “into their hand” and “into your hand” (with a plural “you”). Since this expression refers to a group of people, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **hand**. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns]])
7:1	q9lu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	חֲרֹ֑ד & הַ⁠מּוֹרֶ֖ה	1	The word **Harod** means “trembling.” The spring probably got this name because, as [7:3](../07/03.md) describes, all the soldiers who were “afraid and trembling” were dismissed from Gideon’s army there. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate this in a footnote.
7:2	ja78		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִ⁠תִּתִּ֥⁠י אֶת־מִדְיָ֖ן בְּ⁠יָדָ֑⁠ם	1	Here Yahweh is using the term **hand** in the sense of possession. The image is of someone holding something in his hand. That is, when Yahweh speaks of **giving Midian into** the **hand** of the Israelites, the idea is that the Israelites will conquer the Midianites, who will then become subject to them. Alternate translation: [for me to enable them to conquer the Midianites]
7:2	j284		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	בְּ⁠יָדָ֑⁠ם	1	As the Introduction to this chapter discusses, since a group of people is in view here and in similar instances, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **hand**. Alternate translation: [into their hands]
7:2	ww36		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	יָדִ֖⁠י הוֹשִׁ֥יעָה לִּֽ⁠י	1	Here Yahweh is using the term **hand** more in the sense of power. The image is of someone doing something with his hand. That is, if the Israelites claimed that their **hand** had **saved** them, they would be saying that they had saved themselves by their own power. Alternate translation: [We Israelites have saved ourselves by our own power]
7:3	j285		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	קְרָ֨א & בְּ⁠אָזְנֵ֤י הָ⁠עָם֙ לֵ⁠אמֹ֔ר מִֽי־יָרֵ֣א וְ⁠חָרֵ֔ד יָשֹׁ֥ב וְ⁠יִצְפֹּ֖ר מֵ⁠הַ֣ר הַ⁠גִּלְעָ֑ד	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: [proclaim in the ears of the people that anyone who is afraid or trembling may turn back and depart from Mount Gilead]
7:3	ahw6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	בְּ⁠אָזְנֵ֤י הָ⁠עָם֙	1	Yahweh is using one part of Gideon’s soldiers, their **ears**, to mean all of them in the act of hearing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [loudly so that the people can hear]
7:3	gt6x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	יָרֵ֣א וְ⁠חָרֵ֔ד	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **afraid** tells why a soldier might be **trembling**. Alternate translation: [is trembling with fear]

7:3	wn6f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	נִשְׁאָֽרוּ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [remained]
7:4	j286		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠אֶצְרְפֶ֥⁠נּוּ לְ⁠ךָ֖ שָׁ֑ם	1	The pronoun **it** refers back to **the people** earlier in the verse. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: [and I will refine the people for you there]
7:4	t9yd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠אֶצְרְפֶ֥⁠נּוּ לְ⁠ךָ֖	1	Yahweh is speaking as if he were literally going to **refine** Gideon’s troops, as if they were a precious metal such as silver or gold and he was going to melt them with heat to remove their impurities. He means that he is going to enable Gideon to identify the best soldiers and keep only them in his army. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [and I will enable you to identify the best soldiers]
7:4	j287		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	וְ⁠הָיָ֡ה אֲשֶׁר֩ אֹמַ֨ר אֵלֶ֜י⁠ךָ זֶ֣ה ׀ יֵלֵ֣ךְ אִתָּ֗⁠ךְ ה֚וּא יֵלֵ֣ךְ אִתָּ֔⁠ךְ וְ⁠כֹ֨ל אֲשֶׁר־אֹמַ֜ר אֵלֶ֗י⁠ךָ זֶ֚ה לֹא־יֵלֵ֣ךְ עִמָּ֔⁠ךְ ה֖וּא לֹ֥א יֵלֵֽךְ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: [And when I tell you that a certain kind of soldier is to go with you, then you must bring that kind of soldier with you, but you must not bring any other kind of soldier with you that I say is not to go with you]
7:5	iem1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	וַ⁠יּ֥וֹרֶד אֶת־הָ⁠עָ֖ם	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “took” instead of **brought**. Alternate translation: [So he took the people down]

You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: [and you shall put in a different group anyone who kneels upon his knees to drink]
7:5	j288		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	יִכְרַ֥ע עַל־בִּרְכָּ֖י⁠ו	1	It might seem that the expression **kneels upon his knees** contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in your language. If so, you can shorten it. Alternate translation: [kneels down]
7:6	j289		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	בְּ⁠יָדָ⁠ם֙ אֶל־פִּי⁠הֶ֔ם	1	Since the author is referring to a group of people, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural forms of **hand** and **mouth**. Alternate translation: [with their hands to their mouths]
7:6	j290		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	כָּרְע֥וּ עַל־בִּרְכֵי⁠הֶ֖ם	1	See how you translated the similar expression in the previous verse. Alternate translation: [knelt down]

Alternate translation: [I will give Midian into your hand and save you]
7:7	gk97		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	אֶתְ⁠כֶ֔ם	1	In this verse, the word **your** is singular because Yahweh is speaking to Gideon as an individual. However, the word **you** is plural because Yahweh is addressing Gideon as representative of all the Israelites. So use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction. Other languages may have different ways of clarifying the meaning. Alternate translation: [you Israelites]
7:7	j292		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠כָל־הָ⁠עָ֔ם יֵלְכ֖וּ	1	Yahweh assumes that when he says **all the people**, Gideon will understand that he means “all the other people,” that is, the soldiers who did not lap the water from their hands. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [But all the soldiers who did not lap the water may go]
7:7	e68m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	אִ֥ישׁ לִ⁠מְקֹמֽ⁠וֹ	1	Yahweh is not referring to a specific **man**. He means each of the men who knelt down to drink. Express this in a way that would be natural in your language. Alternate translation: [each man to his own home]
7:8	j293		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	בְּ⁠יָדָ֜⁠ם	1	See how you translated the same expression in [7:6](../07/06.md). Alternate translation: [into their hands]

7:8	j294		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠אֵ֨ת כָּל־אִ֤ישׁ יִשְׂרָאֵל֙	1	The author assumes that readers will understand that by **every man of Israel** he means the soldiers who had not lapped the water from their hands. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [but the soldiers who had not lapped the water from their hands]
7:8	j295		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וּ⁠מַחֲנֵ֣ה מִדְיָ֔ן הָ֥יָה ל֖⁠וֹ מִ⁠תַּ֥חַת בָּ⁠עֵֽמֶק	1	The author is introducing a new event in the story. The ULT indicates this with the word **Now**. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event.
7:9	j296		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ק֖וּם	1	Yahweh is using the expression **Arise** to tell Gideon to take action and lead his army down into the valley to attack the Midianites. Gideon probably was lying in bed when Yahweh spoke to him **that night**, but the meaning of the term **Arise** is not simply that Gideon should get out of bed. See how you translated the same expression in [4:14](../04/14.md). Alternate translation: [Get going]
7:9	u84q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	רֵ֣ד בַּֽ⁠מַּחֲנֶ֑ה כִּ֥י נְתַתִּ֖י⁠ו בְּ⁠יָדֶֽ⁠ךָ	1	Yahweh is using the term **camp** by association to mean the Midianite army in its camp. Alternate translation: [Go down and attack the Midianite army where it is encamped, for I have given you the power to defeat it]
7:9	j297		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	נְתַתִּ֖י⁠ו בְּ⁠יָדֶֽ⁠ךָ	1	Yahweh is using the past tense to describe something that is going to happen in the future. He is doing this to show that the event will certainly happen. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use the future tense in your translation and express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: [I will certainly give it into your hand]
7:10	u4w3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	וּ⁠פֻרָ֥ה	1	The word **Purah** is the name of a man.
7:11	j99j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	תֶּחֱזַ֣קְנָה יָדֶ֔י⁠ךָ	1	Yahweh is using one part of Gideon, his **hands**, to mean all of him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [you will feel courageous]

The emphasis here may be on the fact that these men were holding weapons because they were sentries guarding the camp. Alternate translation: [to the edge of the camp, where the sentries were]
7:12	p89f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בְּנֵי־קֶ֨דֶם֙	1	See how you translated this expression in [6:3](../06/03.md).
7:12	r5ww		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כָּ⁠אַרְבֶּ֖ה לָ⁠רֹ֑ב	1	The point of this comparison is that just as a **locust** swarm is very great **in multitude**, that is, extremely numerous, so this combined army had a very great number of soldiers. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: [in huge numbers, such as in a swarm of locusts]
7:12	zt6w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	וְ⁠לִ⁠גְמַלֵּי⁠הֶם֙ אֵ֣ין מִסְפָּ֔ר	1	The author is making an overstatement for emphasis.

Similarly, the man is saying **Behold … behold** not to get his comrade to look at something but to get him to pay attention to what he is about to say. Your language may have comparable expressions that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: [and what he found was that a man was recounting … Now listen … and in my dream]
7:13	j300		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	חֲל֣וֹם חָלַ֗מְתִּי	1	It might seem that the expression **I dreamed a dream** contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in your language. If so, you can shorten it. Alternate translation: [I had a dream]

Alternate translation: [that poor Israelite farmer, Gideon, the son of Joash]
7:15	j305		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יִּשְׁתָּ֑חוּ	1	The author means implicitly that Gideon **bowed down** to worship God in thanks for the victory that he realized the Israelites were going to win.

7:15	j306		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וַ⁠יָּ֨שָׁב֙	1	The author is referring only to Gideon, but he means that both Gideon and Purah **returned** to the Israelite camp.

Alternate translation: [Yahweh has given the camp of Midian into your hand, so arise]
7:15	j308		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ק֔וּמוּ	1	Even though Gideon’s men were probably lying in bed, here the term **Arise** does not mean simply that they should get up.

Alternate translation: [to Gideon after he crossed the Jordan]; (2) that the soldiers from Ephraim pursued the fleeing Midianite soldiers across the Jordan River, found and killed Oreb and Zeeb on the east side of the river, and then brought their heads back to Gideon on the west side of the river.

8:intro	zh95				0	# Judges 8 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThe account of Gideon concludes in this chapter.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### The tower in Penuel\n\nAncient cities and towns often built protective towers. Their citizens could go inside them for safety, and from the top of them their soldiers had an advantage in fighting attacking armies. The leaders of Penuel probably thought that they were safe from the Midianites because they had such a tower. Gideon told them that he was going to tear down their tower to show that they should have taken his side in the fight against the Midianites.\n\n### Why did Gideon kill the men of Penuel?\n\nIt seems difficult to understand why, when Gideon returned to Penuel ([8:17](../08/17.md)), he “killed the men of the city.” He had only said he would tear down their tower, just as he had only told the leaders of Succoth that he would whip them with thorny branches, and that was all he did to them. Here is one possible explanation. In [8:16](../08/16.md), the author uses the phrase “the men of Succoth” to mean the same thing as “the elders of the city.” So the phrase “the men of the city” in [8:17](../08/17.md) may refer to the town leaders of Penuel. The author may be saying that when Gideon tore down the tower, this killed the town leaders. That may have happened because those leaders took refuge in the tower, thinking they would be safe from Gideon there because he would not be able to tear down the tower or that he would not tear it down if they were in it. A note to [8:17](../08/17.md) suggests an alternate translation that suggests this meaning.\n\n### Why did Gideon tell his son Jether to kill the Midianite kings?\n\nIn [8:20](../08/20.md), Gideon tells his son Jether, who was still a young man, to kill the Midianite kings Zebah and Zalmunna. This was in some way a symbolic action, but interpreters are not entirely sure of what kind. Here are some possibilities: (1) Gideon could have been intending to give an honor to his son. Gideon had already appeased the Ephraimites by telling them what an honor it had been for them to kill Oreb and Zeeb ([8:3](../08/03.md)), and he may have wanted his firstborn son to have a similar honor. If that is the significance of this action, in your translation you might have Gideon say to Jether, “I will give you the honor of killing these kings.” (2) Gideon could have been intending to dishonor Zebah and Zalmunna. They had apparently killed Gideon’s brothers by murder rather than in battle, and so Gideon did not consider them worthy of being killed by a person of status, such as himself. (In this culture, it was customary for someone to be executed by a person of equal status; see, for example, [1 Kings 2:29](../../1ki/02/29.md).) If that is the significance, you might have Gideon say to Jether, “I am going to have you, a youth, kill them.” (3) Gideon could have wanted to emphasize to Jether that he needed to be prepared to fight against the oppressors of Yahweh’s people, just as he had. In that case, you might have Gideon say, “Kill these enemy kings, as you must be prepared to fight to free Yahweh’s people from oppression.”

The author has also not related it as background information. So readers must infer what happened. It appears that at some point, probably before Yahweh called Gideon to lead an army against the Midianites, their soldiers came into Israel and murdered some of Gideon’s brothers. Because these forces were under the command or authority of Zebah and Zalmunna, Gideon is going to hold them accountable for his brothers’ deaths.

Alternate translation: [What did the men look like whom you killed at Tabor?]; (2) that Gideon is using the question form to announce that he is going to hold Zebah and Zalmunna accountable for the deaths of his brothers. This question seems to have had that significance in this culture. For example, for the same purpose, God says to Cain, “Where is your brother Abel?” ([Genesis 4:9](../../gen/04/09.md)).

As Israelites of strength and influence, they could have led resistance to the Midianites. Alternate translation: [They were of regal bearing, just like you, and we killed them because we perceived them as a threat]; (2) answering Gideon’s question by providing information.

In that case, by **the sons of the king**, they would be referring to Gideon’s sons, at least one of whom is present, as [8:20](../08/20.md) indicates. Alternate translation: [your sons right there]

Alternate translation: [and they no longer oppressed the Israelites]
8:28	j359		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	רֹאשָׁ֑⁠ם	1	Since the author is referring to a group of people, if you retain this image, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **head**. Alternate translation: [their heads]

The author may be using this name here to recall how Gideon tore down the altar to Baal that his father **Joash** had set up. He may be recalling that action to contrast it with Gideon setting up the golden ephod. So it would be in keeping with the author’s purposes to use the name Jerubbaal here in your translation. But if it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain in the text that this is another name for Gideon. Alternate translation: [And Jerubbaal, the son of Joash, that is, Gideon, went]

Alternate translation: [sons of his own]
8:31	j364		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	אֲבִימֶֽלֶךְ	1	The author is introducing **Abimelech** as a new participant in the story. He will be the main character in Chapter 9. If your language has its own way of introducing new participants, you can use it here in your translation.
8:31	j365		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֲבִימֶֽלֶךְ	1	The author could assume that his original audience would know that the Hebrew name **Abimelech** means “my father is king.” While Gideon had refused to become the actual king of Israel, he may have given this name to his son to suggest that he was, in a sense, a king, since he had been offered the kingship. Unfortunately this seems to have made Abimelech ambitious to become an actual king, with disastrous consequences, as Chapter 9 describes. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate the meaning of this name explicitly in your translation. Alternate translation: [Abimelech, which means “my father is king”]
8:32	i3jl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בְּ⁠שֵׂיבָ֣ה טוֹבָ֑ה	1	The author is using a common expression that describes a person being very old. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [when he was very old]

9:intro	zl19				0	# Judges 9 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### “upon one stone”\n\nThe author says in [9:5](../09/05.md) that Abimelech and the men he hired brought all of his half-brothers, the other sons of Gideon, to “one stone” and killed them there. There seems to have been some symbolic significance to this action. The stone might have been a place of formal execution. Abimelech could have killed his half-brothers there to indicate that he had taken authority as king and so no threats to his rule should be allowed to exist. The stone might also have been a religious altar of some kind. Some interpreters believe that Abimelech and the leaders of Shechem were executing Gideon’s sons on a stone altar to avenge his desecration of Baal’s altar. This would explain why money from the temple of Baal-Berith paid for the action. However, since the exact purpose is unclear, it would be best to say no more about this in your translation than the original text does.\n\n### Jotham’s curse\n\nIn [9:20](../09/20.md), Jotham, the one son of Gideon who survived Abimelech’s massacre, says, “may fire go forth from Abimelech and may it consume the lords of Shechem and Beth Millo, and may fire go forth from the lords of Shechem and from Beth Millo and may it consume Abimelech.” This was a curse. Jotham was expressing a desire for bad things to happen to the people who had murdered the sons of the man who had delivered them from the Midianites. What Jotham was ultimately wishing for was God’s justice. He wanted people who had done such bad things to have bad things happen to them. His curse was fulfilled in a literal way when Abimelech burned the lords of Shechem to death in [9:49](../09/49.md). (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/curse]])\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Jotham’s parable about the trees\n\nIn [9:8–15](../09/08.md), Gideon’s surviving son, Jotham, tells the lords of Shechem a parable. A parable is a short story that teaches something that is true. It delivers its lesson in a way that is easy to understand and hard to forget. In many cases, the events in a parable could happen, though they did not actually happen. But in this case, they could not have happened, since this parable is about trees talking to each other about appointing a king. However, either way, the events of a parable are told only to teach the lesson that the listeners are meant to learn. See the first note to [9:8](../09/08.md) for suggestions about how to introduce and begin this parable in your translation.\n\n### Did God send an “evil spirit” to Shechem?\n\nIn [9:23](../09/23.md), the author says that God sent a “bad spirit” that made the lords of Shechem hostile toward Abimelech. The word that the ULT translates as “bad” can also mean “evil,” depending on the context. Some versions of the Bible in various languages translate it as “evil” here. Translators may have encountered that reading. However, the context does not seem to support it. The teaching of the Bible as a whole suggests that God would not use something evil to accomplish his purposes. Also, evil spirits have rebelled against God, and so they have forfeited the right to be part of what he is doing. Moreover, the word “spirit” does not necessarily refer to a spiritual being here. It could refer instead to the attitude that Abimelech and the lords of Shechem had toward one another. This would be the same meaning as in [8:3](../08/03.md), “their spirit abated toward him,” which means, “they no longer had a hostile attitude toward him.” So it seems appropriate to understand the author to be saying in [9:23](../09/23.md) that God caused hostility between Abimelech and the lords of Shechem.\n\n### Why did Gaal go and stand in the gate of Shechem?\n\nIn [9:35](../09/35.md), the author says that “Gaal, the son of Ebed, went out and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city” of Shechem. He does not say explicitly why Gaal did this. Gaal does not seem to have known that Abimelech and his troops were nearby, since Zebul was able to convince him otherwise at first (as the next verse describes). Gaal, given his boast against Abimelech at the temple banquet, may have wanted to watch and see whether there was any danger. He may have expected to be able to see approaching troops while they were still far away and arrange a defense before they arrived. But since the author does not say explicitly why Gaal went out to the city gate, it would probably be best not to suggest any reason for this in your translation.\n\n### Why did the people of Shechem go out of their city the day after Abimelech defeated Gaal?\n\nIn [9:42](../09/42.md), the author says that the people of Shechem went out of their city the day after Abimelech defeated Gaal, but he does not say why. In this verse, “went out” does not seem to describe a military operation, as it does in [9:39](../09/39.md) in the case of Gaal. Instead, the people of Shechem seem to have thought mistakenly that they could let Gaal try to defeat Abimelech and become their ruler and that, if he failed, they could still serve Abimelech. So they were probably just going out to work in their fields. You may find it appropriate to use a different expression in your translation for “went out” in [9:42](../09/42.md) than you do for that phrase in [9:39](../09/39.md).

9:3	ubh9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יֵּ֤ט לִבָּ⁠ם֙ אַחֲרֵ֣י אֲבִימֶ֔לֶךְ	1	Here the **heart** represents the will and inclinations. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [and they decided to make Abimelech their king]
9:3	j375		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	לִבָּ⁠ם֙	1	Since the author is referring to a group of people, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **heart**. Alternate translation: [their hearts]
9:3	j376		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אָחִ֥י⁠נוּ הֽוּא	1	The lords of Shechem are using the term **brother** to mean someone descended from the same ancestor. They do not mean that Abimelech is their literal brother, a child of the same parents. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [He is our kinsman]
9:3	j377		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אָחִ֥י⁠נוּ הֽוּא	1	The lords of Shechem mean implicitly that they expect Abimelech to treat them better than the other sons of Gideon would because he is their relative, while the other sons are not. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [He is our kinsman, so he will treat us well]
9:3	j378		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	אָחִ֥י⁠נוּ הֽוּא	1	It may be more natural in your language to have an indirect quotation here. The UST models one way to do that.
9:4	j379		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	שִׁבְעִ֣ים כֶּ֔סֶף	1	The author is using the word **silver** by association to mean silver shekels, a unit of weight. Alternate translation: [70 shekels of silver]
9:4	yf3w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bweight	שִׁבְעִ֣ים כֶּ֔סֶף	1	A **silver** shekel weighed about 11 grams, so these **70** shekels weighed a little less than a kilogram, or almost two pounds. In your translation, you could use the ancient measurement and spell the word “shekel” the way it sounds in your language. You could also say “coins” rather than “shekels.” Alternatively, you could use the metric measurement given in the UST or another measurement that your language and culture customarily use, or you could use the ancient measurement in your translation and put a modern measurement in parentheses in the text or in a footnote. Alternate translation: [70 silver shekels] or [70 silver coins]
9:4	yf44		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מִ⁠בֵּ֖יתּ בַ֣עַל בְּרִ֑ית	1	The author is speaking of the temple of Baal-Berith as if it had been a **house** in which that false god lived. Alternate translation: [from the temple of Baal-Berith]
9:4	mi77		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	אֲנָשִׁ֤ים רֵיקִים֙ וּ⁠פֹ֣חֲזִ֔ים	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The idea is that because these **men** were **worthless**, that is, unprincipled, they were not careful to do what was right and avoid doing what was wrong, that is, they were **reckless**. So Abimelech could hire them to commit murder, as the next verse describes. Your language may have a comparable expression for people whose consciences do not keep them from doing wrong. Alternate translation: [hardened criminals]
9:5	ilv2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	אֶת־אֶחָ֧י⁠ו בְּנֵֽי־יְרֻבַּ֛עַל	1	The author is specifying that these **brothers** were sons of Abimelech’s father **Jerubbaal** (Gideon) but not of his mother. Your language may have its own term or expression for this relationship. Alternate translation: [his paternal half-brothers]
9:5	jer7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	עַל־אֶ֣בֶן אֶחָ֑ת	1	It appears that killing all **70** of these men **upon one stone** was a symbolic action of some kind. See the Introduction to this chapter for a discussion of what the significance of this action might have been and for suggestions of how to represent that in your translation.
9:5	j380		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	וַ⁠יִּוָּתֵ֞ר יוֹתָ֧ם בֶּן־יְרֻבַּ֛עַל הַ⁠קָּטֹ֖ן כִּ֥י נֶחְבָּֽא	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: [But Jotham, the youngest son of Jerubbaal, hid himself, and so he was left]
9:5	j381		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וַ⁠יִּוָּתֵ֞ר יוֹתָ֧ם	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [But Jotham survived]
9:6	up6d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	וְ⁠כָל־בֵּ֣ית מִלּ֔וֹא	1	The expression **Beth Millo** could be: (1) an expression meaning “the house of Millo,” that is, the residents of a place that was described by that term, which means a fortification. This could be the same place as the “citadel” described in [9:46](../09/46.md). These might therefore have been soldiers or military officers. Alternate translation: [and all of the officers from the citadel]; (2) the name of a town near Shechem. In that case, the author may be leaving the phrase **the lords of** to be understood implicitly in this second instance. Alternate translation: [and all of the leaders of the nearby town of Beth Millo]
9:6	j382		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עִם־אֵל֥וֹן מֻצָּ֖ב אֲשֶׁ֥ר בִּ⁠שְׁכֶֽם	1	The author assumes that readers will know what **oak** and **pillar** he is referring to. Joshua had set up the pillar under that oak there in Shechem as a witness of the covenant that the Israelites had made with Yahweh to worship him alone as their God ([Joshua 24:26–27](../../jos/24/26.md)). You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [beside the oak in Shechem under which Joshua had set up a pillar]
9:6	j383		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	עִם־אֵל֥וֹן מֻצָּ֖ב אֲשֶׁ֥ר בִּ⁠שְׁכֶֽם	1	Making Abimelech **king** next to this **pillar** under this **oak** tree was a symbolic action, given the history of the place. Since the lords of Shechem had given Abimelech money from the temple of Baal-Berith to establish himself as king, Baal-Berith was Abimelech’s patron god. So the location of this ceremony was intended to signify that, in place of their covenant with Yahweh, the people were installing a king who would lead them in the worship of Baal-Berith. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: [under the patronage of Baal-Berith, beside the very same oak tree in Shechem where Joshua had set up a pillar to remind the Israelites of their covenant with Yahweh]
9:7	ksz5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יַּגִּ֣דוּ לְ⁠יוֹתָ֗ם	1	Here the author is not using **they** to refer to specific people. Use an expression for this that would be natural in your language. Alternate translation: [And people told Jotham about this] or [And Jotham was told about this]
9:7	j384		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יַּגִּ֣דוּ לְ⁠יוֹתָ֗ם	1	The author is leaving some information implicit that he assumes readers will understand. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [And they declared to Jotham that the leaders of Shechem had made Abimelech their king]
9:7	j385		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בְּ⁠רֹ֣אשׁ הַר־גְּרִזִ֔ים	1	The author seems to mean that Jotham stood atop a rocky crag, several hundred feet high, that overlooked Shechem, rather than on the very summit of Mount Gerizim. From there the leaders of Shechem could have heard him but he would have been safe from capture. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [on a crag high up on Mount Gerizim]
9:7	j386		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	הַר־גְּרִזִ֔ים	1	Jotham choosing **Mount Gerizim** as the place from which to shout his message was a symbolic action. In [Deuteronomy 11:29](../../deu/11/29.md) and [Deuteronomy 27:12–26](../../deu/27/12.md), Moses had commanded the Israelites to proclaim blessings for keeping Yahweh’s law from Mount Gerizim and curses for breaking Yahweh’s law from the facing Mount Ebal. [Joshua 8:32–34](../../jos/08/32.md) records how Joshua carried out this command. So the location was a reminder of how the people of Israel would be blessed if they remained faithful to Yahweh and cursed if they did not. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: [Mount Gerizim, opposite where curses had been proclaimed against unfaithfulness to Yahweh]
9:7	d3ws		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּשָּׂ֥א קוֹל֖⁠וֹ וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֑א	1	The author is using a common expression that means that Jotham spoke very loudly. (The rocky cliffs in this area would have amplified and projected his voice.) If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [and in a loud voice he cried out]
9:7	j387		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	שִׁמְע֤וּ אֵלַ⁠י֙ בַּעֲלֵ֣י שְׁכֶ֔ם וְ⁠יִשְׁמַ֥ע אֲלֵי⁠כֶ֖ם אֱלֹהִֽים	1	Jotham is making a threat that he assumes the lords of Shechem will understand. He is implicitly threatening that God will not listen to their prayers if they do not listen to him, since God has sent him to them with a message. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [If you do not listen to me, you lords of Shechem, then God will not listen to you when you pray, because I am bringing you a message from God]
9:7	j388		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	שִׁמְע֤וּ & אֲלֵי⁠כֶ֖ם	1	Here and through the end of Jotham’s speech in [verse 20](../09/20.md), the pronouns **you** and “your” are plural and the imperative verbs have plural forms because Jotham is addressing a group of people, the **lords of Shechem**. So use plural forms in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
9:8	p19p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables	הָל֤וֹךְ הָֽלְכוּ֙ הָ⁠עֵצִ֔ים לִ⁠מְשֹׁ֥חַ עֲלֵי⁠הֶ֖ם מֶ֑לֶךְ	1	To make the lords of Shechem recognize that they will have much trouble because they have made Abimelech their king, Jotham tells them a story. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. You could also begin this story in the way that made-up stories usually begin in your language. Alternate translation: [Then Jotham told the lords of Shechem a story to make them realize that they would have much trouble because they had made Abimelech their king. He said, “Once upon a time, the trees went to anoint a king over them]
9:8	j389		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	הָל֤וֹךְ הָֽלְכוּ֙ הָ⁠עֵצִ֔ים לִ⁠מְשֹׁ֥חַ עֲלֵי⁠הֶ֖ם מֶ֑לֶךְ	1	Jotham is repeating the verb “go” (saying **Going** and **went**) in order to intensify the idea that it expresses. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: [The trees went around looking for someone they could anoint as their king]
9:8	j390		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	וַ⁠יֹּאמְר֥וּ לַ⁠זַּ֖יִת מָלְכָ֥ה עָלֵֽי⁠נוּ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: [And they asked the olive tree to reign over them]
9:8	ai6t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	מָלְכָ֥ה עָלֵֽי⁠נוּ	1	This is an imperative, but it communicates a respectful request rather than a command. Use a form in your language that communicates a respectful request. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” to make this clear. Alternate translation: [Please reign over us]
9:9	j391		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר לָ⁠הֶם֙ הַ⁠זַּ֔יִת הֶ⁠חֳדַ֨לְתִּי֙ אֶת־דִּשְׁנִ֔⁠י אֲשֶׁר־בִּ֛⁠י יְכַבְּד֥וּ אֱלֹהִ֖ים וַ⁠אֲנָשִׁ֑ים וְ⁠הָ֣לַכְתִּ֔י לָ⁠נ֖וּעַ עַל־הָ⁠עֵצִֽים	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: [But the olive tree asked them whether it should discontinue its fatness, by which they honor gods and men, in order to go wave over the trees]
9:9	q6h3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֶ⁠חֳדַ֨לְתִּי֙ אֶת־דִּשְׁנִ֔⁠י אֲשֶׁר־בִּ֛⁠י יְכַבְּד֥וּ אֱלֹהִ֖ים וַ⁠אֲנָשִׁ֑ים וְ⁠הָ֣לַכְתִּ֔י לָ⁠נ֖וּעַ עַל־הָ⁠עֵצִֽים	1	The olive tree in the story is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [I am not going to discontinue my fatness, by which they honor gods and men, in order to go wave over the trees!]
9:9	v5cc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	הֶ⁠חֳדַ֨לְתִּי֙ אֶת־דִּשְׁנִ֔⁠י	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **fatness**, you could express the same idea in another way. The tree is referring specifically to the oil that is made from its olives. Alternate translation: [Should I stop producing oil]
9:9	b42t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אֲשֶׁר־בִּ֛⁠י יְכַבְּד֥וּ אֱלֹהִ֖ים וַ⁠אֲנָשִׁ֑ים	1	Here the author is not using **they** to refer to specific people. Use an expression for this that would be natural in your language. Alternate translation: [by which people honor gods and men] or [by which gods and men are honored]
9:9	ctc8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	The word translated as **gods** is plural in form, but it could mean either: (1) gods, as in the ULT. (2) God. Alternate translation: [God]
9:9	a9cy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠הָ֣לַכְתִּ֔י לָ⁠נ֖וּעַ עַל־הָ⁠עֵצִֽים	1	The olive tree is using the term **wave** to suggest implicitly that being a king over the other trees would not be as worthwhile or productive as continuing to make olives for oil. Trees stay rooted in the ground, so the olive tree is using the word **wave**, meaning to sway back and forth in the wind, to represent how kings go around taking care of various official matters. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. The UST models one way to do this.
9:10	j392		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	וַ⁠יֹּאמְר֥וּ הָ⁠עֵצִ֖ים לַ⁠תְּאֵנָ֑ה לְכִי־אַ֖תְּ מָלְכִ֥י עָלֵֽי⁠נוּ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: [So the trees asked the fig tree to come and reign over them]
9:10	j393		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	לְכִי־אַ֖תְּ מָלְכִ֥י עָלֵֽי⁠נוּ	1	The trees are stating the pronoun **you** separately, even though the verb translated as **reign** already includes this meaning. They are doing that to emphasize what they want the personal role of the fig tree to be. The idea is that if the olive tree will not be their king, then the trees would like the fig tree to be their king.  If a speaker of your language would use an explicit pronoun for the same purpose, you may want to use that construction in your translation. If not, your language may have other ways of showing the meaning here. Alternate translation: [Then you be the one to reign over us]
9:11	df3r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	וַ⁠תֹּ֤אמֶר לָ⁠הֶם֙ הַ⁠תְּאֵנָ֔ה הֶ⁠חֳדַ֨לְתִּי֙ אֶת־מָתְקִ֔⁠י וְ⁠אֶת־תְּנוּבָתִ֖⁠י הַ⁠טּוֹבָ֑ה וְ⁠הָ֣לַכְתִּ֔י לָ⁠נ֖וּעַ עַל־הָ⁠עֵצִֽים	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation.

Alternate translation: [And the thornbush told the trees that if in truth they were anointing him as king over them, then they should come and shelter in his shade. But if not, then may fire go forth from the thornbush and consume the cedars of Lebanon]
9:15	cm8a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	בֶּ⁠אֱמֶ֣ת	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **truth**, you could express the same idea in another way. In this context. the word translated as **truth** refers to faithfully fulfilling relational responsibilities towards another person. The thornbush wants to make sure that the other trees sincerely want it to be their king and that they are not anointing it simply because the other trees refused. Alternate translation: [truly] or [in good faith]
9:15	j403		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בֹּ֖אוּ חֲס֣וּ בְ⁠צִלִּ֑⁠י	1	In the story, the thornbush is speaking as if the other trees would literally **shelter** in its **shade**, that is, find protection there from the heat of the sun. This was an image that people in this culture used to describe coming under the protection of a ruler and accordingly accepting an obligation to obey that ruler. [Isaiah 30:2](../../isa/30/02.md), for example, speaks of the Judeans sheltering in the shadow of Egypt, meaning that they agreed to allow Pharaoh to rule them in exchange for his protection. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [then obey me as your king]
9:15	j404		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	בֹּ֖אוּ חֲס֣וּ בְ⁠צִלִּ֑⁠י	1	Jotham’s parable is designed to make the lords of Shechem realize that they have made a great mistake by giving Abimelech the means to kill all of his brothers and then anointing him as king. One way the parable does this is by having one of its characters, the thornbush, say something that is the opposite of the way things really are. A thornbush does not create any **shade** in which anyone or anything can **shelter**. Similarly, Abimelech will not do anything worthwhile for the people of Shechem. He will only cause great trouble for them. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could reflect in your translation how what the thornbush says is the opposite of the way things are. Alternate translation: [come under the shade of my tiny branches]
9:15	hvs5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠אִם־אַ֕יִן	1	The thornbush is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: [But if you are not anointing me in truth] or [But if you are not sincerely intending to obey me as your king]

It is actually making a threat that it will start a fire if it discovers that the other trees have not anointed it king sincerely, that is, if they are not going to obey it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [then I will start a fire that will burn up even the cedars of Lebanon]
9:15	xn44		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	הָ֣⁠אָטָ֔ד	1	The thornbush is speaking about itself in the third person, as subjects would speak of and to a king in this culture. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this in the first person. Alternate translation: [me]

He makes a series of “if” statements in [verses 16](../09/16.md) and [19](../09/19.md) (suggesting in [verses 17](../09/17.md) and [18](../09/18.md) that these statements are not actually true), and then in the second half of [verse 19](../09/19.md) he says what the lords of Shechem should do if they have done what he has described. These verses are all one long sentence. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could translate them as a series of shorter sentences. Alternate translation: [So now, suppose you have acted in truth and in integrity and made Abimelech reign. Suppose you have done good with Jerubbaal and with his house. Suppose that according to the deserving of his hands you have done to him]
9:16	ayq2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וְ⁠עַתָּ֗ה אִם & עֲשִׂיתֶ֔ם	1	Jotham has finished telling the story of the trees, and he is using the expression **So now** to introduce his explanation of the implications of the story. You could indicate this more explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [Now this is how my story applies to you: if you have acted]

Alternate translation: [if you have acted truly and genuinely and made Abimelech reign]
9:16	j409		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אִם־בֶּ⁠אֱמֶ֤ת וּ⁠בְ⁠תָמִים֙ עֲשִׂיתֶ֔ם וַ⁠תַּמְלִ֖יכוּ אֶת־אֲבִימֶ֑לֶךְ	1	In his explanation of the parable, Jotham carries the implications of the idea of **truth** one step farther than in the parable. That term refers to faithfully fulfilling relational responsibilities towards another person. In a sense, just as the trees were not doing right by the thornbush by anointing it king just because the other trees refused, so the lords of Shechem are not doing right by Abimelech by supporting his murderous plot to become king. They should have encouraged him to be honest and humble and peaceful instead. But the person they are most significantly not doing right by is Gideon. Jotham will develop this idea at length in the verses that follow. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [if you have really been fair to Gideon by making Abimelech reign]
9:16	j410		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	בֶּ⁠אֱמֶ֤ת וּ⁠בְ⁠תָמִים֙	1	The terms **truth** and **integrity** mean similar things. Jotham is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: [in complete sincerity]
9:16	nu7n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בֵּית֔⁠וֹ	1	Here, **house** means all the people descended from a particular person. Alternate translation: [his descendants]

If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [according to what his actions deserved]

Alternate translation: [Now consider how my father fought for you and threw his life in front and delivered you from the hand of Midian]
9:17	fpm7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	אֲשֶׁר	1	Jotham is providing background information to remind the lords of Shechem what Gideon had done for the Israelites. They already know this information, but he is bringing it their attention and emphasizing it to show that they have not treated Gideon and his family “according to the deserving of his hands,” as he said in the previous verse. In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture. Alternate translation: [considering that]
9:17	j412		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יַּשְׁלֵ֤ךְ אֶת־נַפְשׁ⁠וֹ֙ מִ⁠נֶּ֔גֶד	1	Jotham is using a common expression that means that Gideon risked his life by leading the armies of Israel and thus going **in front** of them into battle against the Midianites. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. You could also state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [and put his life on the line] or [and risked his life]

In your translation, introduce this contrast in a way that is natural in your language. Since this contrasting material is supplemental to the if-then condition that Jotham develops over the course of [verses 16–19](../09/16.md), you may want to use punctuation to set it apart in some way, such as by setting it off with dashes, as the ULT does, or by putting it in parentheses.

You may wish to state some implicit ideas explicitly for the sake of continuity. Alternate translation: [But you have not treated my father and his family fairly. Instead, today you have arisen against them and have killed his sons, 70 men upon one stone, and you have made Abimelech, the son of his female slave, reign over the lords of Shechem because he is your brother]
9:18	cr5w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	קַמְתֶּ֨ם	1	Jotham is using the word **arisen** within a common expression in which it ordinarily describes subjects revolting against their rulers. In [8:23](../08/23.md), Gideon refused to become king and to have his son and grandson be kings after him, so the lords of Shechem did not literally revolt against the rule of Gideon’s family. Jotham’s point may be that if anyone were to be their king, it should have been Gideon’s legal heirs (just as the olive tree, fig tree, and grapevine would have made better kings than the thornbush), so in that sense making Abimelech king was a revolt against those who should have been accepted as authorities. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [have revolted]
9:18	i5zw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בֵּ֤ית	1	See how you translated the term **house** in [9:16](../09/16.md). Alternate translation: [the descendants of]
9:18	c154		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בֶּן־אֲמָת⁠וֹ֙	1	The author says in [8:31](../08/31.md) that Abimelech’s mother was Gideon’s “concubine.” This means that she was a legal but secondary wife whose children did not have inheritance rights. While female slaves sometimes did become the concubines of their masters, not every concubine was a female slave. Abimelech’s mother seems to have come from a family of standing in Shechem; Gideon may have married her as a concubine rather than as a full wife because she was a foreigner, from the surviving Canaanite population of Shechem. So Jotham is disparaging her by calling her a **female slave**. His main point seems to be that Abimelech has no rights of inheritance and thus no claim to become king. (Unfortunately Gideon suggested otherwise when he named this son Abimelech, meaning “my father is king.”) You could bring out this emphasis in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [who has no rights of inheritance and so no claim to become king as Gideon’s son]
9:18	j415		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֲחִי⁠כֶ֖ם	1	See how you translated the term **brother** in [9:3](../09/03.md). Alternate translation: [is your kinsman]

He is repeating the **if** part of it for clarity, since he has said many other things after first stating that part. If it would be helpful in your language, you could explicitly state the implied “then” before that part of the statement. If you have been translating [verses 16–19](../09/16.md) as a series of shorter sentences, you could make this verse a sentence of its own and indicate that Jotham is introducing his conclusion here. Alternate translation: [So to conclude, if you have acted in truth and in integrity with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice in Abimelech, and may he also rejoice in you]

If it would be helpful in your language, you could explicitly state the implied “then” before the second part of this statement. Alternate translation: [But if not, then may fire go forth]
9:20	j416		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠אִם־אַ֕יִן	1	Jotham is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

Jotham is using fire to represent the destruction of warfare. He means that, if Abimelech and the lords of Shechem have not treated Gideon and his family right, then he hopes and expects that they will turn against each other and fight a war and destroy each other. (Part of what he said actually was fulfilled literally, when Abimelech burned the tower of Shechem, as [verse 49](../09/49.md) describes.) If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [may Abimelech and you lords of Shechem fight a war against each other that destroys all of you]
9:21	j417		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יָּ֣נָס יוֹתָ֔ם וַ⁠יִּבְרַ֖ח	1	While the words **escaped** and **fled** mean similar things, the author does not seem to be using them together for emphasis (for example, to mean “hurriedly ran away”) or to express a single idea through them (for example, to mean “escaped by running away”). He seems to mean implicitly that Jotham **escaped** from Shechem, that is, he was able to shout his message without being captured, and then **fled** to the city of Beer where he was apparently safe from Abimelech. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [Then Jotham escaped from Shechem and fled for safety]
9:21	fglz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִ⁠פְּנֵ֖י	1	See the discussion of this phrase in the Introduction to Judges, and see how you translated the similar expression in [2:3](../02/03.md). Alternate translation: [away from the presence of]

9:22	j420		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל	1	The author is using all of **Israel** to mean one part of Israel. The narrative suggests that Abimelech ruled primarily over the city of Shechem and its surrounding towns. (Recall from [1:7](../01/07.md) that in Canaan at this time, each city and town had a ruler who had the title of “king.”) His authority and influence may have extended somewhat farther from there, through the territory of Ephraim and possibly into neighboring tribes. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [that part of Israel]

The word **spirit** could refer to: (1) the attitude that Abimelech and the lords of Shechem had towards one another. Alternate translation: [Then God caused hostility between Abimelech and the lords of Shechem]; (2) a spiritual being. Alternate translation: [Then God sent a spiritual being that caused Abimelech and the lords of Shechem to fight with each other]

It is not indicating why or how the lords of Shechem “dealt treacherously” with Abimelech. You may wish to clarify this for your readers. It may be helpful to begin a new sentence here. Alternate translation: [God did this so that the violence of the 70 sons of Jerubbaal would come upon, and to put their blood upon, Abimelech]
9:24	j422		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	חֲמַ֖ס שִׁבְעִ֣ים בְּנֵֽי־יְרֻבָּ֑עַל	1	The author is using this possessive form to describe the **violence** that was committed against **the 70 sons of Jerubbaal**, not to describe any violence that they committed. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: [the violence that was committed against the 70 sons of Jerubbaal] or [the violence that the 70 sons of Jerubbaal suffered]

This expression uses the term **blood** by association to mean death. Alternate translation: [and to hold their brother Abimelech, who killed them, responsible for their deaths] or [and to avenge their deaths by punishing their brother Abimelech, who killed them]

9:25	b7tx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ל⁠וֹ֩	1	The phrase **against him** could mean: (1) to the disadvantage of Abimelech, that is, discrediting his authority and undermining the stability of his rule.

9:25	j426		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עַ֚ל רָאשֵׁ֣י הֶ⁠הָרִ֔ים	1	By **hills**, the author may mean Mount Gerizim and Mount Ebal. (This word can describe either hills or mountains.)

He means that the people of Shechem **trod** on the grapes that they had picked. That is, they stepped on them to squeeze the juice out of them so that they could make wine from it. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [and squeezed the grapes to make wine]

Gaal is referring to the same person by the names **Abimelech** and **Shechem**. However, there is a slight difference in meaning. The second phrase makes a mild concession, indicating that perhaps there is some basis to serve Abimelech, since he is from the city of Shechem and his mother is related to the people who live there. (In [9:3](../09/03.md), the people of the city say of Abimelech, “He is our brother,” meaning “our kinsman.”) You may wish to indicate this in your translation. Alternate translation: [Why should we serve Abimelech, even though he is from Shechem?]
9:28	j431		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	נַעַבְדֶ֔⁠נּוּ	1	Gaal is using the pronoun **we** to refer to himself and his listeners, so use the inclusive form of that word if your language marks that distinction.

His point is that Abimelech is the son of somebody outside their people group, an Israelite. Gaal may be using the name Jerubbaal instead of Gideon to make a further point, that Abimelech’s father opposed the worship of Baal, while the people of Shechem are devoted to Baal. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [He is the son of Jerubbaal, an Israelite who opposed the worship of Baal]
9:28	j432		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	וּ⁠זְבֻ֣ל פְּקִיד֑⁠וֹ	1	The author could have indicated in [9:22](../09/22.md), when he briefly described Abimelech’s reign, that Abimelech appointed a man named Zebul as his **deputy** to govern Shechem whenever he was not present there. However, the author is instead reporting what Gaal said at this festival as a way of introducing **Zebul** as a new participant in the story. If this would not be clear to your readers, you could explain in a footnote that Zebul was a man whom Abimelech had appointed to govern Shechem whenever he himself was away from the city.

However, on this occasion, he means that they should serve a specific descendant of Hamor, their ancestor, instead of Abimelech. Alternate translation: [You should always be serving one of the descendants of Hamor] or [You should be serving a fellow descendant of Hamor instead]
9:28	rq5n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֲבִ֣י שְׁכֶ֔ם	1	While a man named **Hamor** had literally been the **father** of a man named **Shechem** ([Genesis 34:2](../../gen/34/02.md)), Gaal probably means that Hamor was the ancestor of the people who lived in Shechem. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [the founder of Shechem] or [the ancestor of the people of Shechem]
9:28	j434		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וּ⁠מַדּ֖וּעַ נַעַבְדֶ֥⁠נּוּ אֲנָֽחְנוּ	1	Gaal is stating the pronoun **we** separately, even though the verb translated as **should we serve** already includes this meaning. He is doing that in order to contrast Abimelech’s ancestry with the ancestry of the people of Shechem. If a speaker of your language would use an explicit pronoun for the same purpose, you may want to use that construction in your translation. If not, your language may have other ways of showing the meaning here. Alternate translation: [But why should we, who are descendants of Hamor, serve Abimelech, who is an Israelite?]
9:28	ju72		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וּ⁠מַדּ֖וּעַ נַעַבְדֶ֥⁠נּוּ אֲנָֽחְנוּ	1	Gaal is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [But we, we should not serve Abimelech!]
9:29	v1e2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וּ⁠מִ֨י יִתֵּ֜ן אֶת־הָ⁠עָ֤ם הַ⁠זֶּה֙ בְּ⁠יָדִ֔⁠י	1	The question **who will give** was a characteristic way for a Hebrew speaker to introduce a wish. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this question as a statement or exclamation expressing a wish. Alternate translation: [I wish that someone would give this people into my hand!]
9:29	j436		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר֙ לַ⁠אֲבִימֶ֔לֶךְ רַבֶּ֥ה צְבָאֲ⁠ךָ֖ וָ⁠צֵֽאָ⁠ה	1	Gaal is speaking to Abimelech even though he is not present and cannot hear him. Gaal is doing this to show in a strong way how he feels about Abimelech. He is actually speaking to the people who can hear him, the others who are present at this feast. If your readers might not understand why Gaal is speaking to someone who is not present, you could translate his words as if he were speaking directly to others who are present. You could also describe what Gaal is doing here, as the UST does. Alternate translation, continuing the direct quotation: [I would fight against him and his whole army and defeat him!]
9:29	j437		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	רַבֶּ֥ה צְבָאֲ⁠ךָ֖	1	Gaal is probably not saying that Abimelech should seek a larger number of troops than are already at his disposal. He is probably saying that even if Abimelech summoned all of the men who would willingly serve in his army, he would not be afraid to fight a battle with him. (Abimelech probably ordinarily traveled with just a small number of bodyguards, and Gaal is boasting that he could defeat a much larger force than that.) You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [mobilize your forces]
9:30	a53k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֶת־דִּבְרֵ֖י גַּ֣עַל	1	The author is using the term **words** to represent what Gaal said by using words. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [what Gaal said]
9:30	u13b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יִּ֖חַר אַפּֽ⁠וֹ	1	See the discussion of this term in the Introduction to Judges, and see how you translated the similar expression in [2:14](../02/14.md). Alternate translation: [and he became furious]
9:31	u898		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	בְּ⁠תָרְמָ֣ה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **deceit**, you could express the same idea in another way. The idea is that Zebul sent the messengers openly but pretended that he was sending them for some other reason. The idea is not that Zebul sent the messengers secretly so that no one knew he had sent them. Alternate translation: [deceitfully]
9:31	sl8i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הִנֵּה֩ & וְ⁠הִנָּ֛⁠ם	1	See the discussion of this term in the Introduction to Judges, and see how you translated the similar expression in [1:2](../01/02.md). Alternate translation: [Now listen … and pay attention]
9:31	j438		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠אֶחָי⁠ו֙ בָּאִ֣ים שְׁכֶ֔מָ⁠ה	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [9:26](../09/26.md). Alternate translation: [has come to Shechem with a band of men]
9:31	gvg1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֶת־הָ⁠עִ֖יר	1	Zebul’s messengers are using the term **city** by association to mean the people of the city. Alternate translation: [the people of the city]
9:32	j18v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וְ⁠עַתָּה֙	1	The messengers are not using the word **now** to mean “at this moment.” They are using the word to draw attention to the important point that follows. Alternate translation: [So this is what you should do:]
9:32	j439		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	ק֣וּם & וֶ⁠אֱרֹ֖ב	1	While these are imperatives, the messengers are using them to communicate a recommendation from Zebul rather than a command. Translate them with a form that someone would use in your language to address a superior. Alternate translation: [I would recommend that you arise … and hide]
9:32	j440		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ק֣וּם	1	See how you translated the word **arise** in [4:14](../04/14.md). While Abimelech and his troops would have to get up out of bed in order to travel to Shechem **at night**, the meaning is not simply that they should do that, but that they should take action to defeat the rebellion. Alternate translation: [get going] or, perhaps more deferentially, [take action]
9:32	j441		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בַּ⁠שָּׂדֶֽה	1	Since [9:36](../09/36.md) indicates that Abimelech and his troops launched their attack from “the tops of the hills,” and the people of Shechem grew their crops in the valley between the hills, not up on the hills, the messengers are probably using the word **field** to mean the open area outside the city. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [in the countryside]
9:33	j443		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	תַּשְׁכִּ֖ים וּ⁠פָשַׁטְתָּ֣ & אֵלֶ֔י⁠ךָ וְ⁠עָשִׂ֣יתָ & יָדֶֽ⁠ךָ	1	The words **you** and **your** are singular throughout this verse because the messengers are addressing Abimelech directly. However, they are speaking of what he and his troops will do, so it may be more natural for you to use plural forms if your language marks that distinction.
9:33	j444		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ה֞וּא	1	The pronoun **he** refers to Gaal. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: [Gaal]
9:33	k1f3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֖ר תִּמְצָ֥א יָדֶֽ⁠ךָ	1	The messengers are using a common expression that means that Abimelech would do what the opportunity allowed and the situation directed. In other words, Zebul was not making any further recommendation about what Abimelech should do at this point but leaving it to his discretion. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [as the opportunity presents]
9:33	jne9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	וְ⁠הָיָ֤ה בַ⁠בֹּ֨קֶר֙ כִּ⁠זְרֹ֣חַ הַ⁠שֶּׁ֔מֶשׁ תַּשְׁכִּ֖ים וּ⁠פָשַׁטְתָּ֣ עַל־הָ⁠עִ֑יר	1	The messengers are continuing to communicate a recommendation from Zebul. Translate this using forms that someone would use in your language to address a superior. Alternate translation: [And I would recommend that in the morning, as the sun rises, you start early and rush against the city]
9:34	be8t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יָּ֧קָם	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [9:32](../09/32.md). Alternate translation: [So … got going]
9:34	j445		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֶּאֶרְב֣וּ עַל־שְׁכֶ֔ם	1	The verb translated as **ambushed** here is the same one that was translated as “ambushers” in [9:25](../09/25.md) and as “hide” in [9:32](../09/32.md). Abimelech and his troops followed Zebul’s advice to hide so that they could not be seen and so that they could launch a surprise attack in the morning. Alternate translation: [and they set up an ambush against Shechem]
9:35	j446		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֵּצֵא֙ גַּ֣עַל בֶּן־עֶ֔בֶד וַ⁠יַּעֲמֹ֕ד פֶּ֖תַח שַׁ֣עַר הָ⁠עִ֑יר	1	See the discussion of this verse in the Introduction to this chapter. Since the author does not say explicitly why Gaal **stood in the entrance of the gate of the city**, it would probably be best to say no more about this in your translation than the original text does.
9:35	j447		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יָּ֧קָם & מִן־הַ⁠מַּאְרָֽב	1	In this context, the word **arose** does refer literally to standing up from a sitting or lying position. Alternate translation: [and … stood up from where they had been hiding]
9:36	j448		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֶל־זְבֻ֔ל	1	The author expects readers to understand implicitly that Zebul had gone out to the city gate with Gaal. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [to Zebul, who had gone out to the gate with him]
9:36	gz9v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר אֵלָי⁠ו֙ זְבֻ֔ל	1	The author expects readers to understand implicitly that Zebul is not sharing an honest opinion with Gaal. Zebul is trying to deceive him into thinking that Abimelech has not yet arrived, so that Gaal will not be able to prepare his defenses sufficiently. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [But Zebul said to him deceptively]
9:37	j449		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	עָם֙ יֽוֹרְדִ֔ים	1	Here the expression **coming down** is plural, even though the subject, **people**, is singular. In the previous verse, with the same subject, “coming down” was singular. This suggests that Gaal was speaking of a single group of people in the previous verse and that here he is using **people** in a collective sense to mean several groups of people. He is now able to distinguish the separate companies, as Abimelech’s troops get closer. If it would be helpful to your readers, you may wish to reflect this distinction in your translation. The UST models one way to do that.
9:37	j450		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate	טַבּ֣וּר הָ⁠אָ֑רֶץ	1	This expression could be: (1) a description of some geographic feature. Alternate translation: [the center of the land] or [the crest of that hill]; (2) the name of one of the hills around Shechem. Gaal could be pointing out a specific location by name, as he does later in the verse by naming a large tree. If you represent this as a name, you could translate the meaning into your own language, or you could use the words of the Hebrew text and spell them the way they sound in your language. Alternate translation: [the Navel of the Land] or [Tabbur Haarets]
9:37	j451		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate	אֵל֥וֹן מְעוֹנְנִֽים	1	This expression could be: (1) the name of a large tree near Shechem. You could translate the meaning of this name into your own language, or you could use the words of the Hebrew text and spell them the way they sound in your language. Alternate translation: [the Fortunetellers’ Tree] or [Elon Meonenim]; (2) a description of some geographic feature. Alternate translation: [that large tree over there where people tell fortunes]
9:38	j452		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אַיֵּ֨ה אֵפ֥וֹא פִ֨י⁠ךָ֙	1	Zebul is referring to the confidence that led Gaal to boast against Abimelech by association with the **mouth** with which Gaal made this boast. Alternate translation: [Where now is your confidence]
9:38	qap7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	אַיֵּ֨ה אֵפ֥וֹא פִ֨י⁠ךָ֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר תֹּאמַ֔ר	1	Zebul is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [You no longer seem as confident as when you said]
9:38	j453		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	אֲשֶׁ֣ר תֹּאמַ֔ר מִ֥י אֲבִימֶ֖לֶךְ כִּ֣י נַעַבְדֶ֑⁠נּוּ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: [by which you asked who Abimelech was, that you should serve him]
9:38	fub2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מִ֥י אֲבִימֶ֖לֶךְ כִּ֣י נַעַבְדֶ֑⁠נּוּ	1	Gaal was using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [We should not serve Abimelech!]
9:38	j454		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	כִּ֣י נַעַבְדֶ֑⁠נּוּ	1	In the statement he made in [9:28](../09/28.md), which Zebul is quoting here, Gaal was using the pronoun **we** to refer to himself and his listeners, so use the inclusive form of that word if your language marks that distinction. If you translate this statement as an indirect quotation, the word “you” that is equivalent to **we** should be plural.
9:38	qdj1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠לֹ֨א זֶ֤ה הָ⁠עָם֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר מָאַ֣סְתָּה בּ֔⁠וֹ	1	Zebul is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [This is the people that you despised!]
9:38	j455		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	הֲ⁠לֹ֨א זֶ֤ה הָ⁠עָם֙ & בּֽ⁠וֹ	1	Gaal is thinking of these **people** as a group and so he is using the singular pronoun **it**. It may be more natural in your language to use a plural pronoun. Alternate translation: [Are these not the people … with them]
9:39	j456		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וַ⁠יֵּ֣צֵא גַ֔עַל & וַ⁠יִּלָּ֖חֶם בַּ⁠אֲבִימֶֽלֶךְ	1	As the Introduction to Judges discusses, the author is using **Gaal** and **Abimelech** to represent them and their armies. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [So Gaal led his soldiers into battle … against Abimelech and his soldiers]
9:39	j457		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לִ⁠פְנֵ֖י בַּעֲלֵ֣י שְׁכֶ֑ם	1	See the discussion of the term **to the face** in the Introduction to Judges. Alternate translation: [before the lords of Shechem]
9:40	j458		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וַ⁠יִּרְדְּפֵ֣⁠הוּ אֲבִימֶ֔לֶךְ	1	The author is using the last thing that happened in this battle to mean everything that happened in the battle. Abimelech and his army defeated Gaal and his men, so they retreated, and Abimelech **pursued** them. Alternate translation: [And Abimelech routed him] or [And Abimelech defeated him so that he gave up and retreated]
9:40	j459		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	חֲלָלִ֥ים	1	The author is using the adjective **wounded** as a noun to mean a certain kind of person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can translate this adjective with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: [wounded soldiers]
9:40	p7lv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַֽ⁠יִּפְּל֛וּ	1	The author is using the word **fell** to mean ”died,” by association with the way that people fall down when they die. Alternate translation: [And … died]
9:40	j460		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עַד־פֶּ֥תַח הַ⁠שָּֽׁעַר	1	The implication is that Gaal’s men would have been safe if they had been able to go through the **gate** back into the city. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [before they could get safely back inside the city gate]
9:41	y21z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	בָּ⁠ארוּמָ֑ה	1	The word **Arumah** is the name of a town. It was about five miles away from Shechem.
9:41	j461		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠אֶת־אֶחָ֖י⁠ו	1	See how you translated the same expression in [9:26](../09/26.md). Alternate translation: [and his band of men]
9:42	j462		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	וַ⁠יֵּצֵ֥א	1	It is clear from the narrative that this action was not completed by the time it was **reported** to Abimelech. It was something that the people were planning to do and that was in process. It may be more natural in your language to use a different verb tense to indicate this. Alternate translation: [that … were going out]
9:42	j463		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	הַ⁠שָּׂדֶ֑ה	1	The author is using the word **field** to mean all of the cultivated land around Shechem. It may be more natural in your language to use the plural form of that word, here and in the next two verses. Alternate translation: [to the fields]
9:42	em2h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יַּגִּ֖דוּ לַ⁠אֲבִימֶֽלֶךְ	1	Here the author is not using **they** to refer to specific people. Use an expression for this that would be natural in your language. Alternate translation: [and the people reported this to Abimelech] or [and this was reported to Abimelech]
9:43	j464		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֶת־הָ⁠עָ֗ם & הָ⁠עָם֙	1	In its first instance in this verse, the expression **the people** refers to Abimelech’s army, as in [9:34–38](../09/34.md). In its second instance, this expression refers to the citizens of Shechem, as in [9:42](../09/42.md). You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. The UST models one way to do this.
9:43	e8ph		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֶּאֱרֹ֖ב	1	See how you translated the word “hide” in [9:32](../09/32.md). Alternate translation: [and set an ambush]
9:44	j465		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וַ⁠אֲבִימֶ֗לֶךְ	1	In this verse, the author provides fuller details about how Abimelech and his soldiers killed the people of Shechem who had gone out into the fields, as he described briefly at the end of the previous verse. The ULT indicates this with the word **For**. Your language may have a connecting word or phrase that you can use in your translation to indicate that this verse is providing fuller details about what the author has just said. Alternate translation: [They were able to do this because Abimelech]
9:44	h6g9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יַּ֣עַמְד֔וּ	1	The context indicates that the pronoun **they** refers to Abimelech and the soldiers who were with him in one of the three **companies** into which he had divided his army. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: [And Abimelech and the men who were with him in one company stood]
9:44	a246		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	פֶּ֖תַח שַׁ֣עַר הָ⁠עִ֑יר	1	The author means implicitly that Abimelech and one group of soldiers went to the **gate of the city** to keep anyone who was in the fields from getting back into the city for safety. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [at the entrance of the gate of the city to keep anyone from getting back into the city for safety]
9:45	j466		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠יִּזְרָעֶ֖⁠הָ מֶֽלַח	1	The author is speaking as if Abimelech literally took **salt** and **sowed** it as seed that would grow up from the ground. He means that Abimelech scattered salt all over the ruins of Shechem the way people in this culture scattered seed that they were planting. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [and scattered salt all over it]
9:45	t928		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וַ⁠יִּזְרָעֶ֖⁠הָ מֶֽלַח	1	Scattering salt all over the ruins of Shechem was a symbolic action. Abimelech did this to express the wish that the city would always be an uninhabited wasteland, like a salt desert. It was as if he was saying, “May no one ever live here again.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: [and sowed it with salt to express the wish that it would always be an uninhabited wasteland]
9:46	j467		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	בַּעֲלֵ֖י מִֽגְדַּל־שְׁכֶ֑ם	1	Here the author is probably re-introducing participants to the story whom he has mentioned earlier. They seem to be the same people who are described in [9:6](../09/06.md) as “Beth Millo,” officers from a military post near the city that included its defensive tower. If your language has its own way of re-introducing participants, you can use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: [the officers of the military post that included the tower of Shechem]
9:46	lty1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בֵּ֖ית	1	See how you translated the same expression in [9:4](../09/04.md). Alternate translation: [the temple of]
9:46	kw6q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	אֵ֥ל בְּרִֽית	1	The expression **El-Berith** seems to be another name for the false god that is called Baal-Berith in [8:33](../08/33.md) and [9:4](../09/04.md). El-Berith means “god of the covenant,” while Baal-Berith means “master of the covenant.” So that readers will know that this is the same false god, you could use the name Baal-Berith here, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: [their false god]
9:47	hnv1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וַ⁠יֻּגַּ֖ד לַ⁠אֲבִימֶ֑לֶךְ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [And someone reported to Abimelech]
9:48	j468		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּקַּח֩ אֲבִימֶ֨לֶךְ אֶת־הַ⁠קַּרְדֻּמּ֜וֹת בְּ⁠יָד֗⁠וֹ	1	In this context, as the similar uses in [1 Samuel 14:34](../../1sa/14/34.md) and [Jeremiah 38:10](../../jer/38/10.md) show, this expression means that Abimelech brought axes with him. That is, he had his men bring as many axes with them as they could. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [and Abimelech brought axes with him] or [and Abimelech had his men bring axes with them]
9:49	j469		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	וַ⁠יַּצִּ֧יתוּ עֲלֵי⁠הֶ֛ם אֶֽת־הַ⁠צְּרִ֖יחַ בָּ⁠אֵ֑שׁ	1	It might seem that the expression **burned … with fire** contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in your language. If so, you can shorten it. Alternate translation: [and they used them to set fire to the citadel] or [and they burned the citadel with them]
9:50	nyj8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֵּ֥לֶךְ אֲבִימֶ֖לֶךְ אֶל־תֵּבֵ֑ץ וַ⁠יִּ֥חַן בְּ⁠תֵבֵ֖ץ	1	The author is leaving some information implicit that he assumes readers will understand. The people of **Thebez** had apparently also rebelled against Abimelech. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. The UST models one way to do this.
9:51	j470		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	כָּל־הָ⁠אֲנָשִׁ֣ים וְ⁠הַ⁠נָּשִׁ֗ים וְ⁠כֹל֙ בַּעֲלֵ֣י הָ⁠עִ֔יר	1	The author is making an overstatement for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the emphasis in a different way. Alternate translation: [and a large number of the men and women and of the lords of the city]
9:52	jgq2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יִּלָּ֖חֶם בּ֑⁠וֹ	1	The author is using the tower, represented by the pronoun **it**, by association to mean the people who were in the tower. Alternate translation: [and fought with the people who were in the tower]
9:52	j471		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	לְ⁠שָׂרְפ֥⁠וֹ בָ⁠אֵֽשׁ	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [9:49](../09/49.md). Alternate translation: [to set it on fire] or [to burn it down]
9:53	j472		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	אִשָּׁ֥ה אַחַ֛ת	1	The author is using the phrase **one woman** to introduce this woman as a participant in the story. While she has only a brief role, it is an important one. If your language has its own way of introducing new participants, you can use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: [a certain woman]
9:53	z9j6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	פֶּ֥לַח רֶ֖כֶב	1	A **millstone** was a large, flat, round stone that was used to grind grain. Two of these stones were used together, with the grain between them. The **upper millstone** was the top one that was rolled on the lower one to crush the grain. If your readers would not be familiar with this object, in your translation you could use the name of a similar thing that your readers would recognize, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: [a heavy stone]
9:54	j473		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	פֶּן־יֹ֥אמְרוּ לִ֖⁠י אִשָּׁ֣ה הֲרָגָ֑תְ⁠הוּ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: [lest they say about me that a woman killed me]
9:55	j474		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אִֽישׁ־יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל	1	The author assumes that his readers will know that the people of Thebez were Canaanites and that he can therefore use the phrase **the men of Israel** to mean the soldiers who were fighting with Abimelech against Thebez. (Apparently many Israelites were loyal to Abimelech, even though it was the Canaanites who lived in Shechem who first made him king on the basis that he had a Canaanite mother.) You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [the Israelites who had been supporting Abimelech]

If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [So God made Abimelech experience the same kind of harm he had done to his father by killing his 70 brothers]

While he is using one part of them, their **head**, to represent all of them, this expression is especially apt in light of the story, in which Abimelech dies when a heavy stone lands on his head. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [And God also made the people of Shechem experience painfully the same kind of harm that they had done to other people]

9:57	j479		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	אַנְשֵׁ֣י שְׁכֶ֔ם	1	Here the masculine term **men** seems to have a generic sense. The author specifies in [9:49](../09/49.md) that both “men and women” died when the tower of Shechem burned, so this summary reference to that punishment would include both men and women. Alternate translation: [the people of Shechem]

Alternate translation: [and everything happened to them just as Jotham, the son of Jerubbaal, said it would when he cursed them]
10:intro	zqn2				0	# Judges 10 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter introduces the account of Jephthah, which continues in Chapters 11 and 12.\n\n### Literary devices that point to structure\n\nPossessive forms\n\nWithin the list of people groups in [10:6](../10/06.md), the author uses slightly different possessive forms to make a distinction that is significant for what happens as the book continues. He uses the name of a country or city to speak of the gods of Aram, Sidon, and Moab. But he describes the inhabitants of a country or cities when he speaks of the gods of “the sons of Ammon” and “the Philistines.” This is because, as the next verse indicates, it was the Ammonites and the Philistines who next conquered and oppressed the Israelites and whom the next two judges opposed. Jephthah defeated the Ammonites, as [chapters 11](../11/01.md) and [12](../12/01.md) describe, and Samson fought against the Philistines, as [chapters 13–16](../13/01.md) describe. If possible, use slightly different possessive forms in your own translation to reflect this distinction. The UST models one way to do this.\n\nOrder of information\n\nIn [10:7](../10/07.md), the author presents new information in a particular order for a specific reason. In the book, he relates the oppression by the Ammonites and the deliverance by Jephthah in [chapters 10–12](../10/01.md), before he describes the oppression by the Philistines and the resistance of Samson in [chapters 13–16](../13/01.md). But in this verse he is creating a special arrangement between the phrase “into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the sons of Ammon” and those next sections of the book. This arrangement is known as a chiasm. In it, the first and last parts match and the middle parts match. In other words, the author is creating this arrangement: Philistines—Ammonites (this phrase); Ammonites—Philistines (the next sections of the book). However, if it would better help your readers to recognize how this phrase introduces the following accounts of Jephthah and Samson, you could name these people groups in the order in which they feature in the narrative. You might say, in other words, “into the hand of the sons of Ammon and into the hand of the Philistines”

(The author uses the same verb for “crush” in [9:53](../09/53.md) to describe what the millstone did to Abimelech’s skull.)

11:intro	q7si				0	# Judges 11 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThe account of Jephthah continues in this chapter.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Why did Jephthah sacrifice his daughter?\n\nThe story of Jephthah defeating the Ammonites has a tragic ending. He vows that if Yahweh will give him victory, upon his return, he will sacrifice the first person who comes out of his house as a burnt offering. This person turns out to be his daughter, his only child. But he fulfills his vow anyway and sacrifices her. Part of the explanation for this is that Jephthah’s half-brothers drove him away from their home in Israel so that he had to live in Syria. The Syrians practiced human sacrifice, and Jephthah apparently came to regard it as a way of influencing a deity. The rest of the explanation is that Jephthah did not know the provisions of the law of Moses. In [Leviticus 27:1–8](../../lev/27/01.md), Yahweh tells Moses that if someone dedicates a person, he must redeem that person by paying a certain amount of silver shekels. That is what Jephthah was supposed to do. It was all right for him to devote a family member to Yahweh as long as he then redeemed that person. The author of Judges is using this story to show what happens when, as he says in [17:6](../17/06.md) and [21:25](../21/25.md), everyone does what is right in his own eyes, rather than what Yahweh has commanded. This supports the overall argument of the book that Israel should have a good king who makes sure that the Israelites follow the law of Moses.

Alternate translation: [Now there was a man named Jephthah, a Gileadite, who was a warrior of valor]
11:1	j501		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	גִּבּ֣וֹר חַ֔יִל	1	See how you translated the same expression in [6:12](../06/12.md). Alternate translation: [a valiant warrior]
11:1	yk6s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	גִּלְעָ֖ד	1	Here the word **Gilead** is the name of a man, not the name of a region. But the word **Gileadite** does refer to someone who came from the region called Gilead.
11:2	r35b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	וַ⁠תֵּ֧לֶד אֵֽשֶׁת־גִּלְעָ֛ד ל֖⁠וֹ בָּנִ֑ים	1	The author does not say specifically whether Gilead became the father of Jephthah before or after he was married. However, the story seems to suggest that it was before and that Jephthah was somewhat older than his half-brothers, since they had to wait until they grew up to drive him away from the family. Your language may have a connecting phrase that you can use to indicate this. Alternate translation: [Later, when Gilead had a wife, she bore sons to him]
11:2	j502		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events	וַ⁠יְגָרְשׁ֣וּ אֶת־יִפְתָּ֗ח וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמְרוּ ל⁠וֹ֙ לֹֽא־תִנְחַ֣ל בְּ⁠בֵית־אָבִ֔י⁠נוּ כִּ֛י בֶּן־אִשָּׁ֥ה אַחֶ֖רֶת אָֽתָּה	1	Since the **sons of the wife** said this to Jephthah before they **drove** him **out**, in your translation you may wish to relate these events in the order in which they happened. Alternate translation: [and they said to Jephthah, “You will not inherit in the house of our father, for you are the son of another woman.” And they drove him out]
11:2	j503		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בְּ⁠בֵית־אָבִ֔י⁠נוּ	1	Here, **house** represents the family of Gilead. (He may have died by this point, since it appears that Jephthah was a member of the household while he was alive.) Alternate translation: [as if you were a proper member of family]
11:2	j504		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	בְּ⁠בֵית־אָבִ֔י⁠נוּ	1	Gilead was the father of Jephthah and his half-brothers, so it may be natural for you to use the inclusive form of **our** if your language marks that distinction. However, since the half-brothers are describing **the house of our father** to Jephthah as something that he has no place in, some languages, considering the entire phrase, might use the exclusive form.
11:3	j506		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מִ⁠פְּנֵ֣י	1	Here, **from the face of** is a common expression of the culture that means “because of” or “on account of.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [on account of] or [because of]
11:3	i4w7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	אֶחָ֔י⁠ו	1	These brothers were sons of Jephthah’s father but not of his mother. Your language may have its own term or expression for this relationship. Alternate translation: [his half-brothers]
11:3	aw1r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	ט֑וֹב	1	The word **Tob** is the name of a region. It seems to have been a part of Aram (Syria) that was near Gilead.
11:3	f5ze		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יֵּצְא֖וּ עִמּֽ⁠וֹ	1	This expression means that Jephthah led these men on raids to get plunder. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [and they all formed a gang of bandits]
11:4	s6ku		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֖י מִ⁠יָּמִ֑ים וַ⁠יִּלָּחֲמ֥וּ בְנֵֽי־עַמּ֖וֹן עִם־יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	The author is using this phrase to return to the main story after providing background information about Jephthah. This is the same event that was described in [10:17](../10/17.md). Alternate translation: [It was some days after that when the sons of Ammon fought with Israel]
11:4	cn67		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִ⁠יָּמִ֑ים	1	The author is using the term **days** to mean “time.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [after some time]
11:5	j507		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֕י	1	The author is using this phrase to introduce a further development in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for this purpose.
11:6	b37n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	לְכָ֕⁠ה וְ⁠הָיִ֥יתָה לָּ֖⁠נוּ לְ⁠קָצִ֑ין	1	The elders are making a polite request of Jephthah. Translate this with a form that is suitable for a polite request in your language. Alternate translation: [Please come and be our commander]
11:7	j508		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠לֹ֤א אַתֶּם֙ שְׂנֵאתֶ֣ם אוֹתִ֔⁠י וַ⁠תְּגָרְשׁ֖וּ⁠נִי מִ⁠בֵּ֣ית אָבִ֑⁠י	1	Jephthah is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [It is clear that hate me, since you drove me from the house of my father!]
11:7	j509		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	הֲ⁠לֹ֤א אַתֶּם֙ שְׂנֵאתֶ֣ם אוֹתִ֔⁠י וַ⁠תְּגָרְשׁ֖וּ⁠נִי מִ⁠בֵּ֣ית אָבִ֑⁠י	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: [You drove me from the house of my father, and that shows that you hate me!]
11:7	j510		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠תְּגָרְשׁ֖וּ⁠נִי מִ⁠בֵּ֣ית אָבִ֑⁠י	1	It was Jephthah’s half-brothers, not the elders of Gilead, who drove him from the house of his father. Jephthah may mean that the elders were implicated in this action because they did nothing to help him. Alternate translation: [since you did nothing to help me when my brothers drove me from the house of my father]
11:7	f7vj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מִ⁠בֵּ֣ית אָבִ֑⁠י	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [11:2](../11/02.md). Alternate translation: [from my family]

If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. The UST models one way to do this.
11:8	ph3x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	לָ⁠כֵן֙ עַתָּה֙ שַׁ֣בְנוּ אֵלֶ֔י⁠ךָ	1	The elders are using the word translated as **Therefore** to acknowledge the reason why they have **returned** to Jephthah to ask for his help. They do not mean that they have come because they hate Jephthah or because they drove him out. They mean that they have come because they have trouble. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: [Yes, it is because we are in trouble that we have returned to you]
11:8	uem9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	וְ⁠הָלַכְתָּ֣ עִמָּ֔⁠נוּ וְ⁠נִלְחַמְתָּ֖ בִּ⁠בְנֵ֣י עַמּ֑וֹן וְ⁠הָיִ֤יתָ לָּ֨⁠נוּ֙ לְ⁠רֹ֔אשׁ לְ⁠כֹ֖ל יֹשְׁבֵ֥י גִלְעָֽד	1	The elders are actually describing a condition in which a second event will take place if a first event does. Alternate translation: [Now if you come with us and fight with the sons of Ammon, then you shall be for us the head of all of the dwellers of Gilead]
11:8	j512		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לְ⁠רֹ֔אשׁ	1	See how you translated the same term in [10:18](../10/18.md). Alternate translation: [the ruler]
11:9	j513		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	אִם־מְשִׁיבִ֨ים אַתֶּ֤ם אוֹתִ⁠י֙ לְ⁠הִלָּחֵם֙ בִּ⁠בְנֵ֣י עַמּ֔וֹן וְ⁠נָתַ֧ן יְהוָ֛ה אוֹתָ֖⁠ם לְ⁠פָנָ֑⁠י אָנֹכִ֕י אֶהְיֶ֥ה לָ⁠כֶ֖ם לְ⁠רֹֽאשׁ	1	This could mean: (1) that Jephthah is restating the condition that the elders described in order to confirm it. Your language may have an expression that you can use to indicate this. Alternate translation: [Now let me get this straight: If you have brought me back to fight with the sons of Ammon and Yahweh gives them over to my face, I will be the head for you]; (2) that Jephthah is asking the elders to confirm the description they have described. Alternate translation: [If you have brought me back to fight with the sons of Ammon and Yahweh gives them over to my face, will I really be the head for you?]
11:9	j514		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠נָתַ֧ן יְהוָ֛ה אוֹתָ֖⁠ם לְ⁠פָנָ֑⁠י	1	Jephthah is using this expression to mean that Yahweh would enable him to defeat the Ammonites. (Gideon used a very similar expression in [8:7](../08/07.md) when he spoke of Yahweh “giving” Zebah and Zalmunna into his “hand.”) If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [and Yahweh enables me to defeat them]
11:9	j515		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לָ⁠כֶ֖ם לְ⁠רֹֽאשׁ	1	See how you translated the same term in the previous verse. Alternate translation: [your ruler]
11:10	j516		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-oathformula	יְהוָ֗ה יִהְיֶ֤ה שֹׁמֵ֨עַ֙ בֵּֽינוֹתֵ֔י⁠נוּ אִם־לֹ֥א כִ⁠דְבָרְ⁠ךָ֖ כֵּ֥ן נַעֲשֶֽׂה	1	The elders are swearing an oath by describing a condition. If it would be clearer in your language, you could put the first part of the condition (**if**) before the second part of the condition (the implied “then”). Alternate translation: [If we do not do according to your word, then may Yahweh be hearing the things between us]
11:10	sqxx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יְהוָ֗ה יִהְיֶ֤ה שֹׁמֵ֨עַ֙ בֵּֽינוֹתֵ֔י⁠נוּ אִם־לֹ֥א כִ⁠דְבָרְ⁠ךָ֖ כֵּ֥ן נַעֲשֶֽׂה	1	In this context, the idea of Yahweh **hearing** includes the aspect of Yahweh judging and punishing people for not doing the things he has heard them promise. Alternate translation: [If we do not do according to your word, then may Yahweh punish us for not keeping the promises he has heard us make to you]
11:10	j517		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בֵּֽינוֹתֵ֔י⁠נוּ	1	The elders are speaking of the commitments that they and Jephthah have made to each other as if they were literally something that had taken on actual form in the space **between** them. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: [the things that have passed between us] or [the commitments we have made to each other]
11:10	j518		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אִם־לֹ֥א כִ⁠דְבָרְ⁠ךָ֖ כֵּ֥ן נַעֲשֶֽׂה	1	The elders are using the term **word** to represent what Jephthah has just said by using words. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [if we do not do exactly what you have said]
11:11	j519		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events	וַ⁠יָּשִׂ֨ימוּ הָ⁠עָ֥ם אוֹת֛⁠וֹ עֲלֵי⁠הֶ֖ם לְ⁠רֹ֣אשׁ וּ⁠לְ⁠קָצִ֑ין וַ⁠יְדַבֵּ֨ר יִפְתָּ֧ח אֶת־כָּל־דְּבָרָ֛י⁠ו לִ⁠פְנֵ֥י יְהוָ֖ה בַּ⁠מִּצְפָּֽה	1	It may be that Jephthah reaffirmed the commitments that he and the elders had made to each other before he formally became the **head** and **commander** of the **people**. In your translation, you may wish to relate these events in that order. Alternate translation: [And after Jephthah spoke all of his words to the face of Yahweh at Mizpah, the people set him over them as head and as commander]
11:11	hf4c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	לְ⁠רֹ֣אשׁ וּ⁠לְ⁠קָצִ֑ין	1	See how you translated the word **head** in [11:8–9](../11/08.md). Alternate translation: [not only as their military commander but also as their ruler]
11:11	w6mk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֶת־כָּל־דְּבָרָ֛י⁠ו	1	The author is using the term **words** to represent something that Jephthah said by using words. It seems that he repeated **at Mizpah** the same thing he said to the elders in [11:9](../11/09.md). Alternate translation: [the same thing he had said to the elders]
11:11	v6uq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לִ⁠פְנֵ֥י יְהוָ֖ה	1	Here, **to the face of** represents being in the presence of Yahweh. This is probably a reference to a solemn assembly of **the people**, where it was understood that Yahweh would be present. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [in a solemn assembly of the people, where Yahweh was present]
11:12	su7k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd	מַה־לִּ֣⁠י וָ⁠לָ֔⁠ךְ כִּֽי־בָ֥אתָ אֵלַ֖⁠י לְ⁠הִלָּחֵ֥ם בְּ⁠אַרְצִֽ⁠י	1	Jephthah’s messengers are speaking on his behalf, and so they use the singular pronouns **me** and **my**. They are addressing the Ammonite king, so **you** is also singular. However, Jephthah is speaking as a representative of all the Israelites, and he is addressing the Ammonite king as a representative of his own people and army. So it may be more natural in your language to use the plural pronouns “us” and “our” and plural forms of **you** if your language marks that distinction.
11:12	j520		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מַה־לִּ֣⁠י וָ⁠לָ֔⁠ךְ כִּֽי־בָ֥אתָ אֵלַ֖⁠י לְ⁠הִלָּחֵ֥ם בְּ⁠אַרְצִֽ⁠י	1	Jephthah is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [There is nothing to me and to you, that you should come against me to fight in my land!]
11:12	ybt9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מַה־לִּ֣⁠י וָ⁠לָ֔⁠ךְ	1	This is a common expression that, in this context, inquires what quarrel the Ammonite king has with Jephthah, who represents the Israelites. The implication is that he really has no just cause to invade their land. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [What quarrel is there between us] or [There is no quarrel between us]
11:12	hwk4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בְּ⁠אַרְצִֽ⁠י	1	This could mean: (1) that Jephthah is objecting to the presence of the Ammonite army on Israelite territory. Alternate translation: [and have invaded my land]; (2) that Jephthah is using the term **land** by association to mean the people who live in the land. Alternate translation: [against my people]; (3) that Jephthah is saying that the Ammonite king wants to contest possession of the land. Alternate translation: [over my land]
11:13	j521		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	כִּֽי־לָקַ֨ח יִשְׂרָאֵ֤ל אֶת־אַרְצִ⁠י֙	1	The Ammonite king is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: [I have come against you to fight because Israel took my land]
11:13	ps71		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אֶתְ⁠הֶ֖ן	1	The Ammonite king is using the plural pronoun **them** to refer to the areas bounded by the rivers he names. However, since he uses the singular term **land** to describe this entire territory, it may be more natural in your language to use a singular pronoun. Alternate translation: [it]
11:13	tsw4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	בְּ⁠שָׁלֽוֹם	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **peace**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [peacefully]
11:14	j522		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	וַ⁠יּ֥וֹסֶף ע֖וֹד יִפְתָּ֑ח וַ⁠יִּשְׁלַח֙ מַלְאָכִ֔ים	1	It might seem that saying both **resumed** and **again** would be to state extra information that would be unnatural to express in your language. If so, you could represent just one of these terms. Alternate translation: [Then Jephthah sent messengers once again] or [Jephthah continued to send messengers]
11:15	i4ns		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר	1	The verb **said** is singular. It refers to Jephthah, and it means that Jephthah said this to the king of Ammon through his messengers. However, since a group of messengers actually spoke these words to the king, it might be more natural in your language to use the pronoun “they” with a plural verb. Alternate translation: [and they said]
11:15	j523		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	כֹּ֖ה אָמַ֣ר יִפְתָּ֑ח לֹֽא־לָקַ֤ח יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ אֶת־אֶ֣רֶץ מוֹאָ֔ב וְ⁠אֶת־אֶ֖רֶץ בְּנֵ֥י עַמּֽוֹן	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: [Jephthah says that Israel did not take the land of Moab or the land of the sons of Ammon]
11:15	j524		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לֹֽא־לָקַ֤ח יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ אֶת־אֶ֣רֶץ מוֹאָ֔ב וְ⁠אֶת־אֶ֖רֶץ בְּנֵ֥י עַמּֽוֹן	1	Jephthah recognizes that the Ammonite king is speaking of land that formerly belonged partly to Ammon and partly to Moab. It appears that at this time, the Moabites were either allies or subjects of the Ammonites, and so the Ammonite king regards the Moabites’ interests as his own. The author assumes that his readers will have this knowledge and so he does not explain it as background information. But you could indicate it in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [Israel did not take any land from you Ammonites or from your allies the Moabites]
11:16	j525		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	בַּ⁠עֲלוֹתָ֣⁠ם & וַ⁠יָּבֹ֖א	1	The messengers are using both plural (**their**) and singular (**he**) pronouns to refer to **Israel**, as a group of people and as a nation. It may be more natural in your language to use either plural or singular pronouns consistently. Alternate translation: [when they came up … and they came] or [when he came up … and he came]
11:17	j526		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	לֵ⁠אמֹ֜ר אֶעְבְּרָה־נָּ֣א בְ⁠אַרְצֶ֗⁠ךָ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: [asking for permission to pass through his land]
11:17	v8aa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠לֹ֤א שָׁמַע֙	1	The word translated as **listen** here is the same one that is translated as **heard** in [2:2](../02/02.md) and similar contexts. As the Introduction to Judges discusses, in these contexts the word has the specific sense of complying with what someone has said, by association with the way someone would need to hear what was said in order to obey it. Alternate translation: [But … did not consent]
11:17	q2mz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠גַ֨ם אֶל־מֶ֧לֶךְ מוֹאָ֛ב שָׁלַ֖ח	1	The messengers are leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: [And the Israelites also sent messengers to the king of Moab requesting safe passage through his country]
11:17	x2ue		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֵּ֥שֶׁב יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל בְּ⁠קָדֵֽשׁ	1	The messengers are leaving some information implicit that they assume the Ammonite king will understand. This information supports Jephthah’s claim that the Israelites did not take any territory from the Ammonites or their allies the Moabites. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [In response, the Israelites did not try to force their way through Edom or Moab. Instead, they waited in Kadesh and considered what they should do next]
11:18	el82		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יָּבֹ֤א מִ⁠מִּזְרַח־שֶׁ֨מֶשׁ֙ לְ⁠אֶ֣רֶץ מוֹאָ֔ב	1	The messengers are describing the location of one place relative to another in the way that is characteristic of their culture. In your translation, express this in the way your culture customarily describes the location of places relative to one another. See how you translated the comparable expression in [8:11](../08/11.md). Alternate translation: [and he traveled to the east of the land of Moab]
11:18	j527		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בְּ⁠עֵ֣בֶר אַרְנ֑וֹן	1	The messengers are speaking from a vantage point south of the Arnon River, since the Israelites approached it from the south on their journey from Egypt. So **the other side** implicitly means the north side. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. See how you translated the similar expression in [10:8](../10/08.md). Alternate translation: [on the north side of the Arnon River]
11:19	msq6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר ל⁠וֹ֙ יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל נַעְבְּרָה־נָּ֥א בְ⁠אַרְצְ⁠ךָ֖ עַד־מְקוֹמִֽ⁠י	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: [and Israel asked him for permission to pass through his land to his own place]
11:19	ur8x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר ל⁠וֹ֙ יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל נַעְבְּרָה־נָּ֥א בְ⁠אַרְצְ⁠ךָ֖ עַד־מְקוֹמִֽ⁠י	1	Jephthah’s messengers are speaking of **Israel** as if it were an individual person who could speak to Sihon. They mean that the messengers whom the Israelites sent to him spoke this message. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [and the messengers said to him, “Please, may we Israelites pass through your land unto our place]
11:19	j528		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	נַעְבְּרָה & בְ⁠אַרְצְ⁠ךָ֖ עַד־מְקוֹמִֽ⁠י	1	The Israelite messengers used both plural (**we**) and singular (**my**) pronouns to refer to themselves, as a group of people and as a nation. It may be more natural in your language to use either plural or singular pronouns consistently. Alternate translation: [may we pass through your land unto our place] or [may I pass through your land unto my place]
11:20	ew16		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	עֲבֹ֣ר בִּ⁠גְבֻל֔⁠וֹ	1	Jephthah’s messengers are using the term **border** by association to refer to all of Sihon’s territory. However, it is significant that they do not say “land,” as they report the Israelite messengers saying in the previous verse. The idea is that not only did Sihon not want the Israelites to walk across his land, he did not want them even to cross the border and come into any part of his territory. Alternate translation: [coming into his territory]
11:21	vp7w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יַּכּ֑וּ⁠ם	1	See how you translated the same expression in [1:5](../01/05.md). Alternate translation: [and they beat them] or [and they defeated them]
11:22	ce2e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	וַ⁠יִּ֣ירְשׁ֔וּ	1	In this verse, Jephthah’s messengers are saying the same thing as in the last sentence of the previous verse. They are describing the same territory as “all the land of the Amorite.” However, they are naming the same specific borders that the Ammonite king did in [11:13](../11/13.md) in order to establish Israel’s claim to that land. So it would be good to include this information. However, it may be clearer in your language to introduce it with a word other than **And** in order to show that this sentence is not saying something additional to the last sentence of the previous verse. It is repeating the meaning, although with further information. Alternate translation: [Indeed, they possessed]
11:22	j529		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֵ֖ת כָּל־גְּב֣וּל הָ⁠אֱמֹרִ֑י	1	The messengers are using the term **border** by association to mean the territory that was enclosed within the borders they describe. Alternate translation: [the entire territory of those Amorites]
11:23	v22e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וְ⁠עַתָּ֞ה	1	The phrase translated as **And now** is an expression that was used in letters and messages of this time to introduce the main topic that the sender wished to address. If your language has a comparable expression that it uses for this same purpose, you can use it in your translation. If not, you do not have to translate this phrase explicitly; you can indicate in other ways that this is the main point that Jephthah wanted his messengers to make. Alternate translation: [Here is my main point:]
11:23	ru3n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וְ⁠אַתָּ֖ה תִּירָשֶֽׁ⁠נּוּ	1	Jephthah’s messengers are using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [So do not think that you can possess it!]
11:23	j530		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	וְ⁠אַתָּ֖ה תִּירָשֶֽׁ⁠נּוּ	1	As in [11:19](../11/19.md), the word **you** is singular here, and it is also singular for the rest of this speech (with one exception that these notes will indicate), because the messengers are addressing the Ammonite king. So use the singular form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
11:24	nr59		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠לֹ֞א אֵ֣ת אֲשֶׁ֧ר יוֹרִֽישְׁ⁠ךָ֛ כְּמ֥וֹשׁ אֱלֹהֶ֖י⁠ךָ אוֹת֥⁠וֹ תִירָ֑שׁ	1	The messengers are using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [You should just possess what Chemosh, your god, causes you to possess]
11:24	z3zh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	כְּמ֥וֹשׁ	1	The word **Chemosh** is the name of a false god.
11:25	k8y5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠עַתָּ֗ה	1	See how you translated the same expression in [11:23](../11/23.md). Alternate translation: [And here is another important point:]

If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: [are you really better than Balak …? Did he contend at all with Israel, or did he fight with them at all?]
11:25	wln3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠ט֥וֹב טוֹב֙ אַתָּ֔ה מִ⁠בָּלָ֥ק & הֲ⁠ר֥וֹב רָב֙ עִם־יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל אִם־נִלְחֹ֥ם נִלְחַ֖ם בָּֽ⁠ם	1	The messengers are using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate these questions as statements or as exclamations. Alternate translation: [you are not really better than Balak …! He did not contend at all with Israel, no, he did not fight with them at all!]
11:25	j531		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	נִלְחַ֖ם בָּֽ⁠ם	1	The messengers are leaving some information implicit that they know the Ammonite king will understand. Most modern readers, however, will not have this information. It is that the land that the Israelites acquired when they defeated Sihon had previously belonged to the Moabites and Ammonites. Sihon had taken it from them. But Balak did not try to get it back. The implication is that unless the Ammonite king thinks that he is greater than Balak, he should not try to get it back either. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [did he fight with them to get back the part of that land that Sihon had earlier taken from the Moabites and Ammonites? No, and you should not either!]
11:26	j532		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ⁠בִ⁠בְנוֹתֶ֜י⁠הָ & וּ⁠בִ⁠בְנוֹתֶ֗י⁠הָ	1	See how you translated the same expression in [1:27](../01/27.md). Alternate translation: [and in the surrounding villages … and in the surrounding villages]

If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [but you did not deliver during that time!]
11:26	pu9w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	לֹֽא־הִצַּלְתֶּ֖ם	1	The word **you** is plural here because the messengers are asking why none of the Ammonites tried to recapture the land during the time they are describing. If your language marks that distinction, you could use the plural form in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of indicating this. Alternate translation: [did you Ammonites not deliver]
11:27	aei3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וְ⁠אַתָּ֞ה עֹשֶׂ֥ה אִתִּ֛⁠י רָעָ֖ה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **wrong**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [but you are doing to me what is wrong]
11:28	j533		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠לֹ֣א שָׁמַ֔ע & אֶל	1	See how you translated the word “listen” in [11:17](../11/17.md). It has the same meaning here. Alternate translation: [But … did not agree not to fight after he heard]
11:28	j534		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	דִּבְרֵ֣י יִפְתָּ֔ח אֲשֶׁ֥ר שָׁלַ֖ח אֵלָֽי⁠ו	1	The author is using the term **words** to represent what Jephthah said by using words. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [the message that Jephthah sent to him]
11:29	j535		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠תְּהִ֤י עַל־יִפְתָּח֙ ר֣וּחַ יְהוָ֔ה	1	See how you translated the similar expression about Othniel in [3:10](../03/10.md). Alternate translation: [Then the Spirit of Yahweh powerfully influenced Jephthah]
11:29	dq1c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יַּעֲבֹ֥ר & וְ⁠אֶת־מְנַשֶּׁ֑ה & גִלְעָ֔ד	1	The author means implicitly that Jephthah **passed through** these areas to summon Israelite men to fight, as Barak did in [4:10](../04/10.md) and Gideon did in [6:34–35](../06/34.md). You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [and he passed through Gilead and Manasseh summoning troops to fight against the Ammonites]
11:30	j536		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וַ⁠יִּדַּ֨ר יִפְתָּ֥ח נֶ֛דֶר לַ⁠יהוָ֖ה וַ⁠יֹּאמַ֑ר	1	Here the author is providing background information to help readers understand what happens in the story. Since the first sentence of [11:32](../11/32.md) describes the same thing as the last sentence of [11:29](../11/29.md), the Israelite attack against the Ammonites, this verse and the next one are describing something that happened just before that. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: [But before he led that attack against the Ammonites, Jephthah vowed a vow to Yahweh and said]
11:30	j537		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	וַ⁠יִּדַּ֨ר יִפְתָּ֥ח נֶ֛דֶר לַ⁠יהוָ֖ה וַ⁠יֹּאמַ֑ר	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The vowing and saying were not two different actions. The word **vowed** indicates what Jephthah was doing when he **said** this. Alternate translation: [And Jephthah solemnly promised Yahweh]
11:30	j538		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	וַ⁠יִּדַּ֨ר יִפְתָּ֥ח נֶ֛דֶר	1	It might seem that the expression **vowed a vow** contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in your language. If so, you can shorten it. Alternate translation: [And Jephthah made a vow]
11:30	j539		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	אִם־נָת֥וֹן תִּתֵּ֛ן	1	Jephthah is repeating forms of the verb **give** in order to intensify the idea that it expresses. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: [If in fact you give]
11:31	kh4e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	אֲשֶׁ֨ר יֵצֵ֜א מִ⁠דַּלְתֵ֤י בֵיתִ⁠י֙ לִ⁠קְרָאתִ֔⁠י	1	Jephthah is using one part of his **house**, its **doors**, to mean all of the house as a place for human habitation. In other words, he is specifying a person, rather than an animal that might come from a field or a stall. (See the discussion in the Introduction to this chapter of how wrong Jephthah was to offer a human sacrifice and for what purpose the author includes this account in the book of Judges.) Alternate translation: [the first member of my household who comes out to greet me]
11:31	j540		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	בְ⁠שָׁל֖וֹם	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **peace**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [peacefully]
11:32	wr1n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וַ⁠יַּעֲבֹ֥ר יִפְתָּ֛ח אֶל־בְּנֵ֥י עַמּ֖וֹן לְ⁠הִלָּ֣חֶם בָּ֑⁠ם	1	Here the author is returning to the main story after providing background information in [11:30–31](../11/30.md). It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: [It was after making this vow that Jephthah passed through to the sons of Ammon to fight with them]
11:33	i18j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וַ⁠יִּכָּֽנְעוּ֙ בְּנֵ֣י עַמּ֔וֹן מִ⁠פְּנֵ֖י בְּנֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [So the sons of Israel subdued the sons of Ammon before their face]
11:33	vdv1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מִ⁠פְּנֵ֖י	1	Here, **from the face of** is a common expression of the culture that means “because of” or “on account of.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [because of]
11:34	j542		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	בְ⁠תֻפִּ֖ים וּ⁠בִ⁠מְחֹל֑וֹת	1	Jephthah’s daughter was probably not carrying and playing several **timbrels**. The author may be using the plural forms **timbrels** and **dances** to indicate that she was leading a group of young women from the community who were together celebrating Jephthah’s victory. (This would be similar to what happens in [1 Samuel 18:6](../../1sa/18/06.md).) Alternate translation: [leading a group of women who were playing timbrels and dancing]
11:34	ng9v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	בְ⁠תֻפִּ֖ים	1	The term **timbrels** describes small percussion instruments. A timbrel is a hand-held drum that may also have pieces of metal around its sides that make sounds when a person shakes or hits the drum. If your readers would not be familiar with what a timbrel is, in your translation you could use the name of a similar thing that your readers would recognize, or you could use a general expression.
11:34	j543		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	וְ⁠רַק֙ הִ֣יא יְחִידָ֔ה אֵֽין־ל֥⁠וֹ מִמֶּ֛⁠נּוּ בֵּ֖ן אוֹ־בַֽת	1	It might seem that this sentence contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in your language. If so, you can shorten it. Alternate translation: [And except for her, he did not have a son or daughter] or [And he did not have a son or daughter apart from her]
11:35	md3n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וַ⁠יִּקְרַ֣ע אֶת־בְּגָדָ֗י⁠ו	1	When Jephthah **tore his garments**, this was a symbolic action that expressed great distress and grief. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: [that he tore his garments to show his great distress]
11:35	qi6c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	הַכְרֵ֣עַ הִכְרַעְתִּ֔⁠נִי	1	Jephthah is repeating forms of the verb **Causing to bow** in order to intensify the idea that it expresses. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: [You have certainly caused me to bow]
11:35	puu2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הַכְרֵ֣עַ הִכְרַעְתִּ֔⁠נִי	1	Jephthah probably does not mean that he is literally bowing down. He is speaking of his grief and distress as if those emotions were so strong that they were keeping him from standing up. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: [You have brought me very low] or [You have caused me very great grief]
11:35	dvs5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠אַ֖תְּ הָיִ֣יתְ בְּ⁠עֹֽכְרָ֑⁠י	1	Jephthah may be implicitly comparing his distress at seeing his daughter with the distress that the Ammonites caused the Israelites when they invading their land. (In [11:7](../11/07.md), Jephthah complained to the elders of Gilead that they were only seeking his help because they were in “trouble.” The author speaks similarly in [10:16](../10/16.md) of the Ammonite invasion as “the trouble of Israel.”) You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [and my distress at seeing you is as great as the distress that the Ammonites caused us]
11:35	j544		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְ⁠אָנֹכִ֗י פָּצִ֤יתִי־פִ⁠י֙ אֶל־יְהוָ֔ה	1	Jephthah is referring to what he vowed to Yahweh, by association with the way he **opened** his **mouth** in order to speak his vow. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [For I have spoken a vow to Yahweh]
11:35	gvy5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠לֹ֥א אוּכַ֖ל לָ⁠שֽׁוּב	1	Jephthah is speaking as if he were literally walking somewhere and could not **turn back** to return to where he was before he started walking. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [and I am not able to break my vow]
11:36	j545		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	פָּצִ֤יתָה אֶת־פִּ֨י⁠ךָ֙ אֶל־יְהוָ֔ה	1	See how you translated the same expression in [11:35](../11/35.md). Alternate translation: [you have spoken a vow to Yahweh]
11:36	j546		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֖ר יָצָ֣א מִ⁠פִּ֑י⁠ךָ	1	Jephthah’s daughter is referring to what he said, by association with the way it **came forth from** his **mouth** when he said it. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [according to what you said]
11:36	e6gu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	נְקָמ֛וֹת	1	Jephthah’s daughter is using the plural form **vengeances** in a context where the singular term “vengeance” would suffice. This suggests that she is using the plural form for emphasis. Your language may use plural forms in the same way. If not, you could express the meaning in another way. Alternate translation: [great vengeance]
11:37	hj6q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	יֵעָ֥שֶׂה לִּ֖⁠י הַ⁠דָּבָ֣ר הַ⁠זֶּ֑ה	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [Please do this thing for me]
11:37	dh7s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	וְ⁠יָרַדְתִּ֣י עַל־הֶֽ⁠הָרִ֔ים	1	As the Introduction to Judges discusses, in Hebrew, writers and speakers generally indicated whether people were going up to a higher elevation or going down to a lower elevation when they traveled. The town of Mizpah was located at a high elevation, and Jephthah’s daughter is indicating that she would like to go down from there and wander the hills in the area. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [and I will wander the hills in this area]
11:39	j547		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	וַ⁠יַּ֣עַשׂ לָ֔⁠הּ אֶת־נִדְר֖⁠וֹ אֲשֶׁ֣ר נָדָ֑ר	1	It might seem that this expression contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in your language. If so, you can shorten it. Alternate translation: [and he did to her what he had vowed to do]
11:39	n4my		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	וְ⁠הִיא֙ לֹא־יָדְעָ֣ה אִ֔ישׁ	1	The author is using this expression to speak of a private matter in a delicate way. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: [And she had never slept with a man] or [And she had never had sexual relations with a man]
11:40	s739		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מִ⁠יָּמִ֣ים ׀ יָמִ֗ימָ⁠ה	1	This is a common expression that means “every year.” (In this context, **days** in the plural means “year.” The usual word for “year” occurs at the end of the verse.) Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. You could also use plain language. Alternate translation: [Year by year] or [Every year]

Alternate translation: [Then the men of Ephraim said, “You, Gilead, are fugitives of Ephraim in the midst of Ephraim, in the midst of Manasseh.” For that, Jephthah assembled all of the men of Gilead and fought with Ephraim. And the men of Gilead struck Ephraim]

Alternate translation: [who live between Ephraim and Manasseh]
12:5	j549		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לְ⁠אֶפְרָ֑יִם	1	The author is using the name **Ephraim** to mean something associated with that tribe.

13:intro	eu67				0	# Judges 13 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter begins the account of Samson, which continues through Chapter 16.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Warning not to cut Samson’s hair\n\nThe angel of Yahweh gave Samson’s parents special instructions about how they were to raise the boy they would have. They were to make a Nazirite vow, a special type of vow dedicating Samson to Yahweh. Part of this vow prohibited cutting the person’s hair. The person also could not drink beer or wine or even eat grapes. Samson’s mother was to observe those prohibitions even while she was pregnant, since anything she ate or drank would also nourish the baby in her womb. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/nazirite]], and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/oath]])\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### The angel of Yahweh\n\nA character whom the author calls “the angel of Yahweh” figures prominently in this chapter. See the discussion of this phrase in the Introduction to Judges and see how you translated the phrase “the angel of Yahweh” in Chapters 2, 5, and 6.

14:intro	cl2d				0	# Judges 14 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThe story of Samson continues in this chapter.\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text. The ULT does this with the poetry in [14:14](../14/14.md) and [14:18](../14/18.md).\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Why did Samson’s parents not want him to marry a Philistine woman?\n\nThe law of Moses forbade Israelites to marry a Canaanite or anyone from a different people group. This is why Samson’s parents did not want him to marry a Philistine woman.\n\n### How could Samson do such great feats of strength?\n\nThe author says of Samson in [14:6](../14/06.md) and [14:19](../14/19.md) that “the Spirit of Yahweh rushed on him.” This means that Yahweh gave Samson extraordinary strength. Samson’s power was the power of Yahweh himself. He was an agent of Yahweh’s judgment against the Philistines.

14:3	k7l9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִ⁠פְּלִשְׁתִּ֖ים הָ⁠עֲרֵלִ֑ים	1	Samson’s father is using the word **uncircumcised** by association to refer to the Philistines as a group that did not worship Yahweh, since they did not practice circumcision, as Yahweh’s covenant with the Israelites required.

14:12	p6r8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	אִם־הַגֵּ֣ד תַּגִּידוּ֩ אוֹתָ֨⁠הּ	1	Samson is repeating forms of the verb **declare** in order to intensify the idea that it expresses.

Alternate translation: [If in fact you are able to declare it]
14:14	s9t1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	שְׁלֹ֥שֶׁת יָמִֽים	1	The implication is that the Philistine young men tried for **three days** to solve the riddle and then gave up and forgot about it until the end of the feast.

15:19	j569		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠תָּ֥שָׁב רוּח֖⁠וֹ	1	The author is speaking as if Samson’s spirit had literally left his body and then **returned**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [and his energy returned]
15:19	j570		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	קָרָ֣א שְׁמָ֗⁠הּ	1	It might seem that the expression **called its name** contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in your language. If so, you can shorten it. Alternate translation: [he named it]
15:19	j571		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate	עֵ֤ין הַקּוֹרֵא֙	1	The word **En-Hakkore** is the name of a place. It means “The Spring of the Caller.” Samson gave it this name because Yahweh provided this spring when he called out to him. In your translation, you could spell this name the way it sounds in your language but then add an explanation of its meaning. Alternate translation: [En-Hakkore, which means “The Spring of the Caller”]
15:19	j572		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עַ֖ד הַ⁠יּ֥וֹם הַ⁠זֶּֽה	1	The author assumes that the reader will understand that by **day**, he means the time at which he is writing. You could say that explicitly if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [at the present time]
15:20	j573		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בִּ⁠ימֵ֥י פְלִשְׁתִּ֖ים	1	The author is using the term **days** to refer by association to the time period when the Philistines ruled over Israel. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express this meaning in another way. Alternate translation: [during the time when the Philistines ruled over Israel]
16:intro	u81n				0	# Judges 16 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThe account of Samson concludes in this chapter.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Why did Samson wear his hair long in seven locks?\n\nIn [16:13](../16/13.md), Samson speaks of the “seven locks of my head,” meaning the seven braids of his long hair. In [Numbers 6:5](../../num/06/05.md), the law of Moses forbade Nazirites to cut their hair. Samson kept his hair long because he was a Nazirite. The law of Moses did not specify that Nazirites needed to wear their hair in seven locks or braids. But Samson was doing that as a symbolic action that represented his dedication to God. The number seven symbolized completeness, so the seven braids could have represented the perfection of God or the complete devotion that the Nazirite vow entailed. However, it would not be appropriate to explain the significance of this action in your translation by having Samson say something such as “the seven braids that show I am dedicated to God.” That is the secret that Samson is trying to keep from Delilah. Though he eventually divulges it, he does not do so when he first mentions the seven braids of his hair. But you might put something about this in a footnote if that would be helpful for your readers.
16:1	ab23		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	וַ⁠יָּבֹ֖א אֵלֶֽי⁠הָ	1	The author is speaking in a polite way about a private matter. Your language may have a similar expression that you can use in your translation or you could express the meaning plainly as in the UST. Alternate translation: [and he had sexual relations with her]
16:2	ab24		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	לַֽ⁠עַזָּתִ֣ים ׀ לֵ⁠אמֹ֗ר	1	Ancient translations of the book of Judges all have the words **And it was told.** The text does not make sense without them. So it appears that these words dropped out of the Hebrew text during the process of copying and transmission. Modern versions of the Bible include them or the equivalent, and we recommend that you do the same in your translation. If your language does not use passive verbal forms, you could express this idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [And the Gazites learned]
16:2	ab25		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וַ⁠יָּסֹ֛בּוּ	1	The author is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: [So they encircled the house that Samson was in]
16:3	ab26		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	אֶל־רֹ֣אשׁ הָ⁠הָ֔ר	1	The author is speaking of the **hill** as if it were a living thing that could have a **head**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly as in the UST.
16:4	ab27		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַֽ⁠יְהִי֙	1	The author is using this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event.
16:4	ab28		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	וַ⁠יֶּאֱהַ֥ב אִשָּׁ֖ה בְּ⁠נַ֣חַל שֹׂרֵ֑ק וּ⁠שְׁמָ֖⁠הּ דְּלִילָֽה	1	The author is using this phrase to introduce Delilah as a new participant in the story. If your language has its own way of introducing new participants, you can use it here in your translation.
16:5	ab29		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יַּעֲל֨וּ אֵלֶ֜י⁠הָ סַרְנֵ֣י פְלִשְׁתִּ֗ים	1	See the discussion in the Introduction to this chapter for an explanation of the author’s use of the words **up** and “down” with descriptions of travel. Alternate translation: [And the lords of the Philistines came to her]
16:5	ab30		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠אֲנַ֨חְנוּ֙ נִתַּן־לָ֔⁠ךְ אִ֕ישׁ	1	The Philistine lords are using a common expression to mean that each one of them will give Delilah the amount specified. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [And each one of us will give you]
16:5	ab31		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	אֶ֥לֶף וּ⁠מֵאָ֖ה כָּֽסֶף	1	The lords are leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context, as in the UST, if that would be clearer in your language.
16:5	ab32		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers	אֶ֥לֶף וּ⁠מֵאָ֖ה כָּֽסֶף	1	It is not clear why the Philistine lords offer to give Delilah 1,100 silver pieces each. Usually people offer a large, round number such as 1,000. Some interpreters suggest that in this culture, adding 100 to a number was a way of specifying exactly that amount and no less. See the similar instance in [20:35](../20/35.md). Alternate translation: [no less than 1,000 pieces of silver]
16:7	ab33		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אִם־יַאַסְרֻ֗⁠נִי	1	Here the author is not using **they** to refer to specific people. Use an expression for this that would be natural in your language. Alternate translation: [If anyone binds me] or [If I am bound]
16:7	ab34		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	אֲשֶׁ֣ר לֹא־חֹרָ֑בוּ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [that no one has dried]
16:7	ab35		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠הָיִ֖יתִי כְּ⁠אַחַ֥ד הָ⁠אָדָֽם	1	Samson is using a common expression to mean he would become as weak as an ordinary person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly, here and in the rest of the chapter. Alternate translation: [and I will have no more strength than anyone else]
16:8	ab36		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	אֲשֶׁ֣ר לֹא־חֹרָ֑בוּ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [that no one had dried]
16:9	ab37		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	פְּלִשְׁתִּ֥ים עָלֶ֖י⁠ךָ שִׁמְשׁ֑וֹן	1	Delilah is using a common expression to mean that the Philistines are approaching to attack. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [The Philistines are coming to attack you, Samson]
16:9	ab38		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֨ר יִנָּתֵ֤ק פְּתִֽיל־הַ⁠נְּעֹ֨רֶת֙ בַּ⁠הֲרִיח֣⁠וֹ אֵ֔שׁ	1	The point of this comparison is that just as **fire** has no difficulty causing a string made of flax to break, so Samson remained strong enough to break the cords very easily. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: [as easily as a string of flax breaks when it touches fire]
16:9	ab39		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠לֹ֥א נוֹדַ֖ע כֹּחֽ⁠וֹ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [So no one discovered the source of his strength]
16:10	b84q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הִנֵּה֙	1	See the introduction to Judges for a discussion of the term **Behold**.
16:11	ac11		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	אִם־אָס֤וֹר יַאַסְר֨וּ⁠נִי֙	1	Samson is repeating forms of the verb **bind** in order to intensify the idea that he is expressing. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: [If in fact they bind me]
16:11	ac12		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	לֹֽא־נַעֲשָׂ֥ה & מְלָאכָ֑ה	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [no one has done work]
16:12	ac13		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כַּ⁠חֽוּט	1	The point of this comparison is that just as **thread** breaks easily, so Samson broke these ropes very easily. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly as in the UST.
16:13	ac14		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	אִם־תַּאַרְגִ֗י אֶת־שֶׁ֛בַע מַחְלְפ֥וֹת רֹאשִׁ֖⁠י עִם־הַ⁠מַּסָּֽכֶת	1	Samson is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. It is likely that Samson used the same expression as on the previous two occasions. Alternate translation: [If you weave the seven locks of my head with the warp, then I will weaken and I will be like one of man]
16:13	ac15		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	אֶת־שֶׁ֛בַע מַחְלְפ֥וֹת רֹאשִׁ֖⁠י	1	Samson is using the word **head** by association to mean the hair on his head. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [the seven locks of my hair]
16:13	tkci		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	אֶת־שֶׁ֛בַע מַחְלְפ֥וֹת רֹאשִׁ֖⁠י	1	See the discussion in the Notes to this chapter of the reason why Samson kept his hair long and wore it in **seven locks** or braids.
16:13	ac17		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	עִם־הַ⁠מַּסָּֽכֶת	1	A **warp** is a set of threads running lengthwise on a loom for weaving cloth. If your readers would not be familiar with what a warp is, in your translation you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: [the threads on your loom]
16:15	ac18		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	אֵ֚יךְ תֹּאמַ֣ר אֲהַבְתִּ֔י⁠ךְ וְ⁠לִבְּ⁠ךָ֖ אֵ֣ין אִתִּ֑⁠י	1	Delilah is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [You say, ‘I love you,’ but your heart is not with me!]
16:15	ac16		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	אֵ֚יךְ תֹּאמַ֣ר אֲהַבְתִּ֔י⁠ךְ וְ⁠לִבְּ⁠ךָ֖ אֵ֣ין אִתִּ֑⁠י	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: [How can you say that you love me when your heart is not with me] or [You say that you love me, but your heart is not with me!]
16:15	ac19		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠לִבְּ⁠ךָ֖ אֵ֣ין אִתִּ֑⁠י	1	Here the **heart** represents a person’s inner thoughts and emotions. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [yet you have not shared your innermost secrets with me]
16:16	ac20		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	הֵצִ֨יקָה לּ֧⁠וֹ בִ⁠דְבָרֶ֛י⁠הָ כָּל־הַ⁠יָּמִ֖ים וַ⁠תְּאַֽלֲצֵ֑⁠הוּ	1	The terms **pressed** and **urged** mean similar things. The author is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: [she pressed him continually with her words all of the days]
16:16	ac21		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הֵצִ֨יקָה לּ֧⁠וֹ בִ⁠דְבָרֶ֛י⁠הָ	1	The author is speaking as if Delilah could have physically **pressed** against Samson with her **words**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [she kept asking him persistently]
16:16	ac22		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בִ⁠דְבָרֶ֛י⁠הָ	1	The author is using the term **words** by association to mean what Delilah said by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [by what she said]
16:16	ac23		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וַ⁠תִּקְצַ֥ר נַפְשׁ֖⁠וֹ לָ⁠מֽוּת	1	The author is using one part of Samson, his **soul**, to mean all of him in the act of wearing out from continual pestering. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [and he wore out to death]
16:16	ac24		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	וַ⁠תִּקְצַ֥ר נַפְשׁ֖⁠וֹ לָ⁠מֽוּת	1	The author is making an overstatement for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the emphasis in a different way. Alternate translation: [and he became so worn out that he could not stand it any longer]
16:17	ac25		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֶת־כָּל־לִבּ֗⁠וֹ	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [16:15](../16/15.md). Alternate translation: [everything about his innermost secret, the source of his strength]
16:17	ac26		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	מוֹרָה֙ לֹֽא־עָלָ֣ה עַל־רֹאשִׁ֔⁠י	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [13:5](../13/05.md). Alternate translation: [I have never cut my hair]
16:17	ac27		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִ⁠בֶּ֣טֶן אִמִּ֑⁠י	1	Samson is using the term **womb** by association to mean birth. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [since I was born]
16:17	ac28		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	גֻּלַּ֨חְתִּי֙	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [If someone shaved off my hair]
16:17	ac29		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ⁠סָ֣ר מִמֶּ֣⁠נִּי כֹחִ֔⁠י	1	Samson is speaking of his **strength** as if it were a living thing that could **turn** away and leave him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly as in the UST.
16:19	bwcz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וַ⁠תְּגַלַּ֕ח	1	Since the author says that Delilah **called to a man**, it appears that he was the one who **shaved** Samson’s hair while she held him quietly on her knees. So the author is using one person who was involved in the process of shaving Samson’s hair, Delilah, to represent everyone who was involved. But since the man himself apparently did the shaving, it may be more natural in your language to use a pronoun here that represents him. Alternate translation: [and he shaved]
16:20	ac30		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events	אֵצֵ֞א כְּ⁠פַ֤עַם בְּ⁠פַ֨עַם֙ וְ⁠אִנָּעֵ֔ר	1	Samson is describing one event before describing another event that would precede it. In your translation, you may wish to relate these events in the order in which they happened. Alternate translation: [I will shake myself and go out like time upon time]
16:20	ac31		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	כְּ⁠פַ֤עַם בְּ⁠פַ֨עַם֙	1	Samson is using a common expression to mean that he would do what he had done previously. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [like all the other times] or [as I did before]
16:20	ac32		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠אִנָּעֵ֔ר	1	Samson seems to be saying that he will **shake** himself free from bonds of some kind. This suggests implicitly that Delilah or the man who shaved Samson also bound him in some way while he was still sleeping. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [and I will shake myself free of these bonds that someone has put on me]
16:20	ac33		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יְהוָ֖ה סָ֥ר מֵ⁠עָלָֽי⁠ו	1	The author is speaking as if Yahweh had physically **turned** away from Samson. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [Yahweh was no longer giving him great strength]
16:21	ac41		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	בַּֽ⁠נְחֻשְׁתַּ֔יִם	1	The Hebrew text uses a dual form to describe these **fetters**. If your language does not use that form, you can use an equivalent expression that conveys the same meaning. Alternate translation: [with a pair of bronze fetters]
16:23	ac42		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	לִ⁠זְבֹּ֧חַ זֶֽבַח־גָּד֛וֹל לְ⁠דָג֥וֹן אֱלֹהֵי⁠הֶ֖ם וּ⁠לְ⁠שִׂמְחָ֑ה	1	It may be more natural in your language to put the information about the **celebration** before the information about the **sacrifice**, since celebrating the capture of Samson provided the occasion for the sacrifice. Alternate translation: [to celebrate by sacrificing a great sacrifice to Dagon their god]
16:23	ac43		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	לִ⁠זְבֹּ֧חַ זֶֽבַח־גָּד֛וֹל	1	It might seem that this expression contains extra information that would be unnatural to express in your language. If so, you can shorten it. Alternate translation: [to offer a great sacrifice]
16:23	ac44		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וּ⁠לְ⁠שִׂמְחָ֑ה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **celebration**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [and to celebrate]
16:23	ac45		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	נָתַ֤ן אֱלֹהֵ֨י⁠נוּ֙ בְּ⁠יָדֵ֔⁠נוּ אֵ֖ת שִׁמְשׁ֥וֹן אוֹיְבֵֽי⁠נוּ	1	It may be more natural in your language to put your translation of the phrase **our enemies** with the information about **Samson**. Alternate translation: [Our god has given our enemy Samson into our hand]
16:23	rrie		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	נָתַ֤ן אֱלֹהֵ֨י⁠נוּ֙ בְּ⁠יָדֵ֔⁠נוּ	1	See the introduction to Judges for a discussion of this phrase.
16:23	ac46		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	אוֹיְבֵֽי⁠נוּ	1	The Philistines are using the plural form **enemies** in a context where one enemy, Samson, seems to be in view. This suggests that they are using the plural form for emphasis. Your language may use plural forms in the same way. If not, you could express the meaning in another way. Alternate translation: [our great enemy]
16:24	ac47		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	וַֽ⁠יְהַלְל֖וּ אֶת־אֱלֹהֵי⁠הֶ֑ם כִּ֣י אָמְר֗וּ נָתַ֨ן אֱלֹהֵ֤י⁠נוּ בְ⁠יָדֵ֨⁠נוּ֙ אֶת־א֣וֹיְבֵ֔⁠נוּ וְ⁠אֵת֙ מַחֲרִ֣יב אַרְצֵ֔⁠נוּ וַ⁠אֲשֶׁ֥ר הִרְבָּ֖ה אֶת־חֲלָלֵֽי⁠נוּ	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: [and they said, “Our god has given into our hand our enemy and the devastator of our land, who multiplied our slain,” so they praised their god]
16:24	ac48		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	אֶת־א֣וֹיְבֵ֔⁠נוּ וְ⁠אֵת֙ מַחֲרִ֣יב אַרְצֵ֔⁠נוּ	1	The people are expressing a single idea by using two phrases connected with **and**. The phrase about Samson being a **devastator** tells in what way he was their **enemy**. Alternate translation: [our enemy who devastated our land]
16:24	ac49		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	וַ⁠אֲשֶׁ֥ר הִרְבָּ֖ה אֶת־חֲלָלֵֽי⁠נוּ	1	The Philistines are using the adjective **slain** as a noun to mean people who have been killed. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you can use a different form of the same root. Alternate translation: [who slew so many of our people]
16:25	ac50		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַֽ⁠יְהִי֙	1	The author is using this phrase to introduce a new event in the story. Use a word, phrase, or other method in your language that is natural for introducing a new event.
16:25	ac51		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	כי טוב לִבָּ֔⁠ם	1	The author is using a common expression to mean that the Philistines were beginning to become drunk from drinking wine. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [when they were feeling giddy from the wine they were drinking]
16:25	ac52		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-events	וַ⁠יִּקְרְא֨וּ לְ⁠שִׁמְשׁ֜וֹן מִ⁠בֵּ֣ית ה⁠אסירים וַ⁠יְצַחֵק֙ לִ⁠פְנֵי⁠הֶ֔ם וַ⁠יַּעֲמִ֥ידוּ אוֹת֖⁠וֹ בֵּ֥ין הָ⁠עַמּוּדִֽים	1	The author is describing one event before describing another event that preceded it. In your translation, you may wish to relate these events in the order in which they happened. Alternate translation: [So they called for Samson from the house of prisoners and made him stand between the columns, and he caused laughter to their faces]
16:26	ac53		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	אֲשֶׁ֥ר הַ⁠בַּ֖יִת נָכ֣וֹן עֲלֵי⁠הֶ֑ם	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [that support the house]
16:26	ac34		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הַ⁠בַּ֖יִת	1	Samson is speaking as if the temple of Dagon were actually a **house** in which he lived.

In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture.
16:27	ac55		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	הָ⁠רֹאִ֖ים בִּ⁠שְׂח֥וֹק שִׁמְשֽׁוֹן	1	The author is using the possessive expression **laughing of Samson** not to describe Samson himself laughing, but the Philistines **laughing** as they were **watching** him. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: [who laughed at Samson when they saw him]
16:28	ac56		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	זָכְרֵ֣⁠נִי	1	Samson is using a common expression to mean that he wants Yahweh to help him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [help me]

If so, you can shorten it. Alternate translation: [so I may avenge myself against the Philistines for both of my eyes at once]
16:29	ac58		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	אֲשֶׁ֤ר הַ⁠בַּ֨יִת֙ נָכ֣וֹן עֲלֵי⁠הֶ֔ם	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [that supported the house]

If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [I shall die with the Philistines]
16:31	ac61		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וַ⁠יֵּרְד֨וּ אֶחָ֜י⁠ו וְ⁠כָל־בֵּ֣ית אָבִי⁠הוּ֮	1	The author is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete.

17:intro	c454				0	# Judges 17 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nThis chapter begins the final section of the book of Judges. In this section, the author describes the atrocities and chaos that characterized the nation in the absence of a godly leader. Many of the judges had been godly leaders who made sure that the people of Israel obeyed Yahweh. But since they were all individuals whom God raised up at specific times, there was not a continuity of godly leadership. As the author says earlier in the book, “when Yahweh raised up for them judges, then Yahweh was with the judge and he saved them from the hand of their enemies all of the days of the judge. … But it happened, at the death of the judge, they turned and acted corruptly more than their fathers, to walk after other gods, to serve them, and to bow down to them. They did not drop {any} of their deeds or {any} of their stubborn ways” ([2:18–19](../02/18.md)). So in this section, the author is showing how important and helpful it would have been to have a continuity of godly leadership such as a line of good kings would provide. A godly leader would guide the people in the true worship of Yahweh and ensure justice and righteousness. This was fulfilled partially by David, and it has now been fulfilled definitively by God’s Messianic king, Jesus.\n\nIn this chapter and the next one, the author describes how idolatry took root in Israel, in the additional territory that the tribe of Dan conquered for itself.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Idols and figures\n\nThe law of Moses forbade the Israelites to make any idols. While the instructions Yahweh gave Moses for the tabernacle included making metal figures, the Israelites were not to make any figures that represented gods that they would worship. This practice was common in Canaan, and it shows the influence the Israelites allowed these people to have on them. Micah’s mother should not have had an image made out of silver, and Micah should not have set it up as an idol and gotten a priest to serve at the shrine where he put it. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/falsegod]])\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### “an idol and a cast image”\n\nThe author speaks of what Micah’s mother had a refiner make from her silver as “an idol and a cast image.” Some interpreters understand this to be two things, while other interpreters understand it to be one thing. Like many languages, Hebrew sometimes expresses a single idea by using two words connected with “and.” If that is what the author is doing here, he means that this was a cast image that served as an idol. In [18:20](../18/20.md), he speaks simply of “the idol” apparently to mean the same thing as “an idol and a molded image” in [18:14](../18/14.md). That suggests that the phrase “an idol and a cast image” does mean a cast image that served as an idol or an idol that was made by casting an image. In your translation, you may wish to use a phrase such as “a molded idol” as the UST does. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys]])

18:intro	y2ru				0	# Judges 18 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nIn this chapter, the author continues to describe how idolatry took root in Israel, in the additional territory that the tribe of Dan conquered for itself.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### The conquest of Laish by soldiers from the tribe of Dan\n\nWhile the author does not say specifically that it was not right for the tribe of Dan to kill all the inhabitants of the city of Laish and take their territory, he indicates this implicitly. He notes that they were Sidonians, not Canaanites such as Yahweh had told the Israelites to drive out, and that they were living peacefully, not posing any threat. The Israelites had been given exceptional instructions to kill all of the Canaanites. Most interpreters believe that this was so that the Canaanites would not influence the Israelites to follow their practices, which were very wicked and destructive. But Yahweh did not tell the Israelites to kill all the people from other groups. So readers are meant to understand implicitly that the soldiers from Dan committed an atrocity against the people of Laish. The author is presenting this as evidence that if Israel had a godly king, he would maintain order and justice throughout the land, protect vulnerable people, and lead Israel away from idolatry and toward proper worship and obedience of Yahweh.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### “an idol and a cast image”\n\nSee the discussion of this phrase, which occurs several times in this chapter, in the Introduction to Chapter 17.

19:intro	gj7f				0	# Judges 19 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and formatting\n\nIn this chapter, the author begins to tell a story that provides further evidence of the benefits of Israel having a godly king. He describes an outrageous crime that Israelite men in the city of Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin committed against a helpless person.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Why did the Levite push his concubine out to the mob?\n\nThis chapter describes how a mob of men in the city of Gibeah wanted to rape a Levite man who was staying in the city overnight. While the men were going to use sex as a weapon, what they intended was ultimately a crime of power and violence. The Levite believed they were going to kill him (see [20:5](../20/05.md)). So to save his own life, he pushed his concubine out to the mob, and they raped and killed her. The author describes this crime as further evidence that Israel needed a godly king who would maintain order and justice and protect vulnerable people. The author is not presenting what the Levite did, or what his host offered to do (surrendering his daughter and the Levite’s concubine to the mob), as exemplary. The Bible is not saying through this story that a sexual crime against a woman is not as bad as a sexual crime against a man. It is not saying that men may or should sacrifice family members in order to save their own lives. The example that the Bible presents for us to imitate is that of Jesus, who sacrificed himself in order to save others.\n\n### Why did the Levite cut up the dead body of his concubine?\n\nThe author describes in [19:29](../19/29.md) how the Levite brought the body of his murdered concubine home and cut it into twelve pieces and sent the pieces throughout the land of Israel. He probably had messengers carry pieces through the territory of each of the twelve tribes and explain what had happened. Cutting the woman’s body into twelve pieces was a symbolic action that called for collective vengeance by all twelve tribes of Israel. The implicit message was that this outrageous crime had defiled the entire land and that the Israelites corporately had a responsibility to cleanse the land by executing justice on the perpetrators. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action in your translation. You might say, for example, “and he cut her body into twelve pieces, one to send to each tribe of Israel to call for collective vengeance.”

19:2	ij5k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠תִּזְנֶ֤ה עָלָי⁠ו֙	1	The expression that the ULT translates as **whored against him** could also mean that the man’s concubine became angry with him because of something that he did. Many versions translate it that way. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of ULT. Alternate translation: [became angry with him]

20:intro	lla1				0	# Judges 20 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nIn this chapter, the author continues the story he began in Chapter 19 which provides evidence of the benefits of Israel having a godly king in the future. He tells how the Benjaminites refused to surrender the men who had committed the outrageous crime and how the Israelites fought a very destructive war against them to purge Israel from the guilt and defilement of this crime.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Why does the Levite say that the “lords of Gibeah” encircled the house?\n\nAs the Levite is giving an account of the crime to the Israelite assembly, he says that “the lords of Gibeah arose against me, and they encircled the house at night against me” ([20:5](../20/05.md)). He probably does not mean that the legal rulers of the city of Gibeah did this, even though he is using the same term that the author uses for such rulers several times in Chapter 9 when he speaks of the “lords of Shechem.” (The phrase “the lords of the Philistines,” which occurs several times in Chapter 16, uses a different term for “lords,” but it has the same meaning.) Rather, the Levite probably means that the wicked men who surrounded the house where he was staying could do whatever they wanted in the city and no one could stop them. It was as if they actually were the “lords” of the city. The UST models one way to convey this meaning.\n\n### Why does the Levite say that the men of Gibeah intended to “kill” him?\n\nThe wicked men in Gibeah shout in [19:22](../19/22.md) to those inside the house that they want to “know” the Levite, that is, to assault him sexually. When the Levite gives an account of their crime in [20:5](../20/05.md), he says that they intended to kill him. He probably says this because he recognizes that while the men were going to use sex as a weapon, they intended to commit a crime of power and violence that would likely have involved killing him in the end. That is what they did to his concubine. The UST models one way to convey this meaning.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### “drawing the sword”\n\nSeveral times in this chapter, the author describes men as “drawing the sword.” He is using one thing that a skilled fighter would learn to do to represent all the things that such a fighter would do. The meaning is that such men were experienced soldiers. Use a word or phrase in your translation that would convey that meaning. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche]])

21:intro	bf76				0	# Judges 21 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nIn this chapter, the author concludes the story he began in Chapter 19 by showing the benefits of Israel having a godly king. He tells how the Israelites realized that they had gone too far in destroying the Benjaminites and how they resorted to further violence and deceit in order to provide wives for the surviving Benjaminites so that they could continue their family lines. The implied information in [21:5](../21/05.md) is that the Israelites thought that if they killed all the people of that city except its young women, they could give them as wives to the surviving men from the tribe of Benjamin.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Sin and immorality\n\nAt the end of Judges, there is much sin and immorality. The people are doing wrong and are trying to fix their wrongs by doing more evil things. The period of the Judges is typified by this final account and summarized by the author’s closing statement, “A man did the right in his eyes” (ULT), which means that “everyone did what they thought they should do” (UST). The book of Judges ends this way in order to lead into the following part of the biblical narrative, which describes how God chose David to be a godly king of the Israelite people. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/evil]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/righteous]])
