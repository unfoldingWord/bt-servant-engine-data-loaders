He begins with how he created everything from nothing, including the earth and all the heavenly bodies (sun, moon, stars), all the plants and animals, and especially how he created human beings in his image to be in a relationship with him. This book also explains how sin and death came into the world and what God’s plan is to save people from that. In fact, all the important teachings in the Bible begin in Genesis. That makes this book foundational and important for everyone so that they can know and understand the truth about God and his plan for their lives.\n\nBeginning with [verse 1](../01/01.md), the book of Genesis is a narrative that tells the history of events that actually happened. This is confirmed by the fact that the conjunctions and the forms of the verbs that are used in the Hebrew text reflect the Hebrew narrative style, which is used to narrate historical accounts. In the same way, those who translate the book of Genesis should also use grammatical structures in their languages that are used for true, historical narratives. God uses narrative, which is one of the most interesting styles of communication, to not only tell people about the events in the early history of the world, but also to teach them about himself and about the way he interacts with people as their loving Creator.\n\nGenesis provides the vital context for the rest of God’s Word, especially the gospel message about Jesus, and so it helps people to understand their need for him to be their Savior. In fact, without Genesis, it would not be clear why everyone needs to trust in Jesus as the only one who can save them from sin and its consequences, so that they can associate with God and be part of his eternal family.\n\nIn light of all that, Genesis should be one of the first books of the Bible that is translated into every language that needs a translation. May God guide and bless you and your translation team as you undertake this important task together by his power.\n\n### Author and date of writing\n\nMoses was the human author of the first five books of the Bible, including the book of Genesis ([Exodus 24:3–4](../../exo/24/03.md); [Deuteronomy 31:9](../../deu/31/09.md), [24](../../deu/31/24.md); [John 1:45](../../jhn/01/45.md)). The Holy Spirit is the one who inspired what Moses wrote in those books ([2 Peter 1:21](../../2pe/01/21.md)), so ultimately God is the author, and these books are part of his Message to mankind. Those five books are sometimes referred to as the Torah (a Hebrew word that means “teaching,” “instruction,” or “law”) or the Pentateuch (a Greek word that means “five books”). In the New Testament this set of books is also referred to as “the Law” ([John 1:45](../../jhn/01/45.md)) or “the Law of Moses” ([Acts 28:23](../../act/28/23.md)), and Jesus himself affirmed that Moses wrote them ([John 5:46–47](../../jhn/05/46.md); [7:23](../../jhn/07/23.md)).\n\nMoses was born in the country of Egypt around 1526 B.C. ([Exodus 2:1–10](../../exo/02/01.md)). According to the genealogies in Genesis, his birth was about 1,000 years after the Flood (which was about 1,650 years after creation). Moses may have written much of the Pentateuch during the forty years that he led the people of Israel as they wandered in the wilderness (around 1446 B.C.—1406 B.C.).\n\nThe very first verse in Genesis assumes that God (the author guiding the human author) has always existed and that he has no beginning and no end (also see [21:33](../21/33.md); [Deuteronomy 33:27](../../deu/33/27.md); [Psalm 90:2](../../psa/090/002.md)). He uses his personal name “Yahweh” for the first time in Genesis [2:4](../02/04.md). The name “Yahweh” means “he is” and indicates that God is eternal. His name also means that he is unchanging and that he is always present.\n\n### Book outline\n\nIn all, Genesis covers a span of about 2200 years of history. After the world’s early history, the rest of Genesis tells about the ancestors of God’s people, with special focus on Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph (and their families). Genealogies are an important part of what ties the book together from beginning to end.\n\nThe following outline shows these two main divisions in the book of Genesis: (1) Early World History, and (2) The History about the Ancestors of God’s Chosen People. Those two divisions each have roughly four main subdivisions, which are based on four key events (in the first division) and four key ancestors (in the second division). Some scholars prefer to divide the book up into ten divisions that are introduced by the Hebrew phrase that means “these are the generations of …” In the outline below, **asterisks** mark the sections that contain that phrase. The phrase is found in Genesis [2:4](../02/04.md) (heavens and earth), [5:1](../05/01.md) (Adam), [6:9](../06/09.md) (Noah), [10:1](../10/01.md), [10:32](../10/32.md) (sons of Noah), [11:10](../11/10.md) (Shem), [11:27](../11/27.md) (Terah), [25:12](../25/12.md) (Ishmael), [25:19](../25/19.md) (Isaac), [36:1](../36/01.md), [36:9](../36/09.md) (Esau), and [37:2](../37/02.md) (Jacob).\n\n**Bolded words** in the outline show which sections contain promises and covenants from God and also mark who the main ancestors were in the various sub-divisions.\n\n#### Division 1: Early World History\n\nCreation\n  - God creates the universe and everything in it ([1:1–2:3](../01/01.md))\n  - Adam and Eve and the Garden of Eden ([2:4–25](../02/04.md))*\n\nThe Fall\n  - The first sin and God’s judgment;

Many translations use a special format to identify these passages as poetry by indenting each clause on a new line. Many other translations do not do this, but rather use regular paragraph formatting everywhere, including for poetry. It may be helpful to look at a translation in the national language of your country that uses poetry formatting, to help you decide whether or not you want to do something similar in your translation. Some translations put some of the following passages in poetry format since these verses have certain features of poetry such as parallelisms and metaphors: Genesis [1:27](../01/27.md); [2:23](../02/23.md); [3:14–16](../03/14.md), [17](../03/17.md)b-19; [4:23–24](../04/23.md); [8:22](../08/22.md); [9:6](../09/06.md), [9:25–27](../09/25.md); [12:2–3](../12/02.md); [14:19–20](../14/19.md); [15:1](../15/01.md); [16:11–12](../16/11.md); [24:60](../24/60.md); [25:23](../25/23.md); [27:27–29](../27/27.md), [27:39–40](../27/39.md); [48:15–16](../48/15.md), [48:20](../48/20.md); [49:1–27](../49/01.md). You may not want to put all these passages in poetry format since some of them have parallelisms that are not necessarily poetry but may just be emphasizing certain events in the narrative or certain points in a prophecy.
1:intro	zb6f				0	# Genesis 1 Chapter Introduction\n\n### Possible titles for this book:\n\n  - “Genesis”\n  - “The Book of Genesis”\n  - “Genesis: The First Book By Moses”\n  - “Genesis: The Book About Beginnings”\n  - “The First Book That God’s Spokesman Moses Wrote: Genesis”\n\nThe English title “Genesis” is a transliteration of a Greek word that means “origin” or “beginning” or “birth”; the ancient Greek translation of the Hebrew scriptures (the Septuagint) uses this word for the first time in Genesis [2:4](../02/04.md). The Hebrew title of this book בְּרֵאשִׁית (pronounced “bereshith”) is the first Hebrew word in [verse 1](../01/01.md) and literally means “In the beginning.” The Latin translation of the Bible (the Latin Vulgate) was the first translation to use the title “The Book of Genesis.” Since that time, many other translations include “Genesis” in the book title because people are familiar with that name. Sometimes, as part of the title, translators also include the fact that Moses was the author and that he was inspired by God.
1:1	uiu4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	בְּ⁠רֵאשִׁ֖ית	1	The first chapter of Genesis is a true, historical narrative (which is indicated by the Hebrew language structures that are used throughout the chapter), and [verse 1](../01/01.md) records the first event in that history. This is confirmed by the wider context of the Scriptures, which teach us that God created everything out of nothing at the very beginning of the world. [Psalm 33:6](../../psa/033/006.md), [Psalm 33:9](../../psa/033/009.md); [Hebrews 11:3](../../heb/11/03.md)). Some languages must use a verb (“began”) in [verse 1](../01/01.md) rather than an abstract noun (**beginning**). Alternate translation: [At the beginning of time]
1:1	hmtj			בָּרָ֣א	1	In the Hebrew Bible, the verb “create” refers to an activity that only God does, and it often implies (as it does here) that he made something out of nothing. Also, the forms of the verbs in the Hebrew text (and the conjunctions) show that [chapter 1](../01/01.md) is a narrative that tells about true history and events in the order that things actually happened. Make sure that your translation does the same thing. Alternate translation: [made]
1:1	bcu7			אֵ֥ת הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֖יִם	1	Alternate translation: [the sky]
1:1	wgq2			וְ⁠אֵ֥ת הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	This phrase refers to the planet earth.
1:2	qfra			וְ⁠הָ⁠אָ֗רֶץ	1	The author pauses here to describe what the earth and the heavens were like after God first created them ([verse 1](../01/01.md)). Some languages use a conjunction like **Now** to introduce that information, while other languages do not use a conjunction here. Do what is natural in your language. Also, be consistent here with how you translated **the earth** in [verse 1](../01/01.md). Alternate translation: [Now at first after that, the earth]
1:2	btmf			הָיְתָ֥ה תֹ֨הוּ֙ וָ⁠בֹ֔הוּ	1	It is not clear what the earth looked like at that time, but it did not have its present shape and order. The phrase **was formless and empty could mean: (1) “did not have its present form, and there was nothing living on it yet” (2) “completely desolate,” which treats the text as a hendiadys. However, it is best to keep both terms separate in your translation (as they are in the Hebrew text).
1:2	f7a1			וְ⁠חֹ֖שֶׁךְ עַל־פְּנֵ֣י תְה֑וֹם	1	Alternate translation: [It was completely dark, there was deep water everywhere] or [and everywhere there was deep water that was surrounded by total darkness]
1:2	rp8q			וְ⁠ר֣וּחַ אֱלֹהִ֔ים מְרַחֶ֖פֶת	1	The clause **and the Spirit of God was hovering** could mean: (1) “and God’s Spirit was hovering” or (2) “and a wind from God was blowing”
1:2	yq4r			עַל־פְּנֵ֥י הַ⁠מָּֽיִם	1	Throughout this chapter, the word **waters** is in the plural in the Hebrew text. For some languages it is more natural to use the singular “water.” Alternate translation: [over the surface of the water] or [above the waters]
1:3	kxuq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֥אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	What God says in [verse 3](../01/03.md) is a command. Consider whether or not it is best in your language to make that explicit in this quote margin. Alternate translation: [Then God commanded]
1:3	o0zd			יְהִ֣י א֑וֹר	1	This is a command, not a permission or a suggestion. It is a direct quote of what God actually said, and it is usually put between quotation marks in a translation. If you use an exclamation point with this command in your translation, make sure it does not mean or imply that God was angry. Also, the way you translate **light** should refer to what shines from a source of light; it does not refer here to the source itself. Alternate translation: [Let light exist] or [I command there to be light]
1:4	ceam		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וַ⁠יַּ֧רְא אֱלֹהִ֛ים	1	Notice that Hebrew frequently uses a conjunction such as **And** or **Then** at the beginning of a sentence. Some languages do not use conjunctions as frequently as Hebrew uses conjunctions. Do what is accurate and natural in your language in each context. Alternate translation: [And he saw] or [He saw]
1:4	bnvs			אֶת־הָ⁠א֖וֹר כִּי־ט֑וֹב	1	In the Bible, **good** is an important theme. Throughout [chapter 1](../01/01.md), it especially means that what God created was high quality, complete, and had no defects; in other words, it had all the characteristics and functions that God intended it to have. The word **good** also includes the idea that what God created was untainted by sin and reflected his good character ([Psalm 19:1](../../psa/019/001.md); [Romans 1:20](../../rom/01/20.md)). The focus here is not on how pleased or satisfied God was. Alternate translation: [that the light was good]
1:4	q3jo			וַ⁠יַּבְדֵּ֣ל אֱלֹהִ֔ים בֵּ֥ין הָ⁠א֖וֹר וּ⁠בֵ֥ין הַ⁠חֹֽשֶׁךְ	1	Alternate translation: [Then he caused the light to have its own time and the darkness to have its own time] or [Then he separated the light from the darkness so that it would be light for a number of hours and then dark for a number of hours]
1:5	c9yz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֨א אֱלֹהִ֤ים	1	Some languages omit the connecting word **And** or **Then** here. Consider what is the best way in your language to connect this sentence with the previous one. Alternate translation: [Then He called] or [God named]
1:5	cc8r			לָ⁠אוֹר֙ י֔וֹם	1	Notice that in this context the word **Day** refers only to the time when the sun is shining, not to the 24-hour time period that makes up a complete day. Make sure that this is clear in your translation. Throughout [chapter 1](../01/01.md), some translations use quote marks around the names that God gives the different things he created.
1:5	xxe6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	וַֽ⁠יְהִי־עֶ֥רֶב וַֽ⁠יְהִי־בֹ֖קֶר	1	The evening and the morning are the parts of a 24-hour day that separate the hours of daytime (light) from the hours of nighttime (darkness): Evening came at the end of each daytime after God finished his work of creating. Then after about 12 hours of nighttime, morning came, which began the next 12 hours of daytime when God did more work. Make sure your translation does not sound like morning came immediately after evening. Some languages have a one-word conjunction that means “and then” or “and later” and would fit well here. Alternate translation: [Then evening came, and then morning came]
1:5	xmx5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	י֥וֹם אֶחָֽד	1	Here, **day** refers to a full 24-hour day. Also, the Hebrew text uses a cardinal number (**one**) here, but then uses ordinal numbers (“second,” “third,” and so on) for the rest of the days of the creation week. Some languages need to use an ordinal number (“first”) here too. Other languages use cardinal numbers throughout (“day one,” “day two,” and so on). Alternate translation: [and that was day one]
1:6	nesq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֔ים	1	See how you translated this phrase in [verse 3](../01/03.md). Alternate translation: [Then God commanded]
1:6	gqae		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	יְהִ֥י רָקִ֖יעַ	1	The Hebrew word for **expanse** here describes a large space that is spread out. It was not solid, but rather it was open and empty, and it could be seen through and flown through ([verse 20](../01/20.md)). It was probably also curved, following the spherical shape of the earth. See how you translated **Let there be** in [verse 3](../01/03.md). Alternate translation: [Let there be a vast space] or [I command there to be a vast space] or [I command a vast space to form]
1:6	mscz			בְּ⁠ת֣וֹךְ הַ⁠מָּ֑יִם	1	See how you translated **waters** in [verse 2](../01/02.md).
1:6	c6kn			וִ⁠יהִ֣י מַבְדִּ֔יל בֵּ֥ין מַ֖יִם לָ⁠מָֽיִם	1	Alternate translation: [and let it divide the water above it from the water below it] or [so that it separates the waters into two different places]
1:7	i8t2			וַ⁠יַּ֣עַשׂ אֱלֹהִים֮	1	[Verse 7](../01/07.md) explains what God’s command in [verse 6](../01/06.md) caused to happen, and it repeats some of the same words and phrases. Make sure that your translation of these verses does not sound like God created the expanse twice. Alternate translation: [In that way God made] or [That is how he made]
1:7	dgya			אֶת־הָ⁠רָקִיעַ֒	1	Alternate translation: [a vast space]
1:7	c752			וַ⁠יַּבְדֵּ֗ל	1	Alternate translation: [and divided] or [and used it to separate]
1:7	pidk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	בֵּ֤ין הַ⁠מַּ֨יִם֙ אֲשֶׁר֙ מִ⁠תַּ֣חַת לָ⁠רָקִ֔יעַ וּ⁠בֵ֣ין הַ⁠מַּ֔יִם אֲשֶׁ֖ר מֵ⁠עַ֣ל לָ⁠רָקִ֑יעַ	1	For some languages it is more natural to use a pronoun (**it**) here to refer to the expanse, since it was just mentioned earlier in the verse. Each language has its own system of when to use nouns or pronouns to refer to people, places, and things. In each context, do what is clear and natural in your language. Alternate translation: [the water that was under it from the water that was above it]
1:7	xfx7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַֽ⁠יְהִי־כֵֽן	1	Alternate translation: [That is the way it happened] or [Everything was exactly as he commanded it to be]
1:8	hh8a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	לָֽ⁠רָקִ֖יעַ	1	See how you translated this phrase in [verses 6](../01/06.md) and [7](../01/07.md). Alternate translation: [the vast space]
1:8	n336			שָׁמָ֑יִם	1	This word probably refers here to the atmosphere above the earth’s surface, where clouds are and where birds fly, as well as the space where the sun, moon, and stars are now. Be consistent here with how you translated this term in [verse 1](../01/01.md).

1:8	adzz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	י֥וֹם שֵׁנִֽי	1	Consider whether it is more natural in your language to use an ordinal number (**second**) here or a cardinal number (“two”). Alternate translation: [and the second day ended] or [and that was the end of day two]
1:9	yc3d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֗ים	1	See how you translated this phrase in [verses 3](../01/03.md) and [6](../01/06.md). Alternate translation: [Then God commanded]
1:9	yetc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	יִקָּו֨וּ הַ⁠מַּ֜יִם מִ⁠תַּ֤חַת הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֨יִם֙	1	Consider whether it is better here in your language to use a passive form of the verb (**be gathered**) or an active form (“gather” or “come”). Alternate translation: [Let the water that is under the sky come together] or [I command the water that is below the heavens to come together]
1:9	as42			אֶל־מָק֣וֹם אֶחָ֔ד	1	Alternate translation: [in one area] or [into one area]
1:9	g8i2			וְ⁠תֵרָאֶ֖ה הַ⁠יַּבָּשָׁ֑ה	1	The water had been covering the land, so when the water receded from it, the land became exposed and dried off. Make sure that the way you translate **dry ground** does not sound like the land was dry while it was under the water. Alternate translation: [so that there is dry land] or [so that dry land can be seen] or [so that land is uncovered and dries off]
1:9	gign			וַֽ⁠יְהִי־כֵֽן	1	See how you translated this sentence in [verse 7](../01/07.md). It may be necessary to translate it in different ways, depending on the context. Alternate translation: [And it was exactly as God commanded it to be]
1:10	eh2f			וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֨א אֱלֹהִ֤ים	1	Alternate translation: [Then he named]
1:10	khag			לַ⁠יַּבָּשָׁה֙	1	Alternate translation: [the dry land] or [the land that had dried off]
1:10	teai			אֶ֔רֶץ	1	This is the same Hebrew word that is translated as “earth” in [verse 1](../01/01.md), but here it refers to the dry land or ground (in contrast to the water), and not to the entire planet. Alternate translation: [Ground]
1:10	c5av		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	וּ⁠לְ⁠מִקְוֵ֥ה הַ⁠מַּ֖יִם קָרָ֣א	1	See how you translated a sentence in [verse 5](../01/05.md) that is similar in structure to this sentence. Alternate translation: [and the waters that he had gathered together he named] or [and he called the gathered waters] or [and he called the waters that had come together]
1:10	sb47			יַמִּ֑ים	1	At that time there was probably just one very large body of water and one very large landmass on the earth (as [verse 9](../01/09.md) indicates). So a singular noun that refers to the largest body of water, such as “Ocean” or “Sea,” could be used here in your translation. Alternate translation: [Oceans]
1:10	hk8y			כִּי־טֽוֹב	1	Some languages cannot use a pronoun (**it**) here, but have to specify what was good. Also see how you translated the word **good** in [verse 4](../01/04.md), and see the note about that there. Alternate translation: [that what he had made was good] or [that the land and the seas were good]
1:11	jq0c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֗ים	1	Alternate translation: [Then God commanded]
1:11	lnyu			תַּֽדְשֵׁ֤א הָ⁠אָ֨רֶץ֙ דֶּ֔שֶׁא	1	The Hebrew word for **vegetation** refers generally here to any kind of green plant and includes the plants and trees that are mentioned next in this verse. Also, see how you translated “Land” in [verse 10](../01/10.md). Alternate translation: [I command the ground to grow green plants] or [The ground must now be covered with green plants]
1:11	sdob			עֵ֚שֶׂב מַזְרִ֣יעַ זֶ֔רַע	1	This phrase refers to many different kinds of plants, not just one plant or one seed. Make sure that is clear in your translation. Also, these kinds of plants have soft stems and include vegetable plants, herbs and other plants that produce edible seeds, such as rice, corn, and wheat. Alternate translation: [including every kind of plant that has seeds] or [including all kinds of plants that bear seeds]
1:11	cv1n			עֵ֣ץ פְּרִ֞י עֹ֤שֶׂה פְּרִי֙ לְ⁠מִינ֔⁠וֹ	1	The phrase **according to its kind** emphasizes that each different kind of tree produces its own kind of fruit and seeds, which grow and become only that kind of tree. For example, apple trees always produce apples with apple seeds, never peaches or cherries, or any other kind of fruit or seeds. Alternate translation: [and fruit trees that bear fruit, each according to its own kind] or [and every kind of fruit tree that bears its own kind of fruit] or [and all kinds of fruit trees that bear their own kind of fruit]
1:11	o8kh			אֲשֶׁ֥ר זַרְע⁠וֹ־ב֖⁠וֹ	1	Alternate translation: [that has seeds inside] or [with its own kind of seeds inside it]
1:11	k8cn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	עַל־הָ⁠אָ֑רֶץ	1	For some languages it is clearer and more natural to put this phrase earlier in this verse and say, “Let the land sprout vegetation throughout the earth …” Alternate translation: [throughout the earth]
1:11	virt			וַֽ⁠יְהִי־כֵֽן	1	Either a period or a colon can be used here, but a colon more clearly shows that [verse 12](../01/12.md) gives the details of what happened. This is different from [verse 7](../01/07.md), where the details of what happened come before **And it was so**, and from [verse 9](../01/09.md), where no additional details are given. Alternate translation: [And it happened exactly as God commanded it to happen:]
1:12	jikr			וַ⁠תּוֹצֵ֨א הָ⁠אָ֜רֶץ דֶּ֠שֶׁא	1	[Verse 12](../01/12.md) explains what God’s command in [verse 11](../01/11.md) caused to happen, and it repeats some of the same words and phrases. Make sure that your translation of these verses does not sound like God created the plants twice. Alternate translation: [The land sprouted plants] or [The land started growing green plants]
1:12	rh5y			עֵ֣שֶׂב מַזְרִ֤יעַ זֶ֨רַע֙ לְ⁠מִינֵ֔⁠הוּ	1	Alternate translation: [including plants that have seeds, each according to its own kind] or [including every kind of plant that has seeds that grow into the same kind of plant] or [including all kinds of plants that have their own type of seeds]

1:12	k58u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כִּי־טֽוֹב	1	See how you translated this clause in [verse 10](../01/10.md). Some languages have to specify what was good. Alternate translation: [that what he had made was good] or [that all the plants and trees were good]
1:13	b3dy			וַֽ⁠יְהִי־עֶ֥רֶב וַֽ⁠יְהִי־בֹ֖קֶר	1	See how you translated this sentence in [verses 5](../01/05.md) and [8](../01/08.md). Alternate translation: [Then evening came, and then morning came]

1:14	f6qj			יְהִ֤י מְאֹרֹת֙	1	These lights refer to the sun, the moon, and stars that give off light. But it is important to keep this general in your translation (like the Hebrew text does) and not specify the names of these lights. Alternate translation: [Let there be objects that give light]
1:14	snjr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	בִּ⁠רְקִ֣יעַ הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֔יִם	1	It might seem that the expression **the expanse of the heavens** contains extra information that would not be natural to express in your language. If so, you could shorten it. The expanse is the same thing as the heavens ([verse 8](../01/08.md)), so some translations leave **the expanse of** implied here. Alternate translation: [in the space of the sky] or [in the open space of the sky] or [in the heavens]
1:14	as7i			לְ⁠הַבְדִּ֕יל	1	Alternate translation: [to divide] or [that separate]
1:14	iva1			וְ⁠הָי֤וּ לְ⁠אֹתֹת֙	1	Alternate translation: [Let those lights also be] or [They will also serve as markers] or [I also command those lights to serve as]
1:14	zf63			וּ⁠לְ⁠מ֣וֹעֲדִ֔ים וּ⁠לְ⁠יָמִ֖ים וְ⁠שָׁנִֽים	1	The sun and moon show the passing of time. For example, the 30-day month is determined by the phases of the moon, and the 365-day year is determined by the time it takes for the earth to travel around the sun. The **seasons** are regular times of the year, such as seed-planting and harvesting times, and the seasons of spring, summer, fall and winter (Genesis [8:22](../08/22.md)), as well as the special festivals which God appointed for his people to meet with him. You could put some of that information in a footnote.
1:15	qfvm			וְ⁠הָי֤וּ לִ⁠מְאוֹרֹת֙	1	Alternate translation: [And they will be sources of light] or [They will serve as lights] or [Their purpose is to serve as sources of light]

1:16	slgo			וַ⁠יַּ֣עַשׂ אֱלֹהִ֔ים	1	[Verses 16-18](../01/16.md) explain what God’s commands in [verses 14-15](../01/14.md) caused to happen. Make sure your translation of these verses does not sound like he created the lights twice. See how you translated **So God made** in [verse 7](../01/07.md). Alternate translation: [In that way God made] or [That is how he made]
1:16	axyb			אֶת־שְׁנֵ֥י הַ⁠מְּאֹרֹ֖ת הַ⁠גְּדֹלִ֑ים	1	This phrase refers to the sun and the moon, which are the two brightest objects in the earth’s sky. However, the author intentionally does not use their names, so you should not include their names in your translation either. Alternate translation: [the two big lights]
1:16	udou			אֶת־הַ⁠מָּא֤וֹר הַ⁠גָּדֹל֙	1	The focus is on the relative brightness or strength of the lights, not on their size. Alternate translation: [the stronger light]
1:16	vq3u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	לְ⁠מֶמְשֶׁ֣לֶת הַ⁠יּ֔וֹם	1	The word **rule** is a figure of speech that means each light has the greatest effect during a particular time period, because it is the brightest light that is shining then. For some languages, nonliving objects like the sun and the moon cannot **rule** because only people can do that. Do what is accurate and natural in your language. Alternate translation: [to govern the day]
1:16	slw4			וְ⁠אֶת־הַ⁠מָּא֤וֹר הַ⁠קָּטֹן֙	1	Alternate translation: [and the dimmer light]
1:16	kas2			לְ⁠מֶמְשֶׁ֣לֶת הַ⁠לַּ֔יְלָה	1	Be consistent here with how you translated **rule** previously in this verse. Alternate translation: [to govern the night]
1:16	vlll		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠אֵ֖ת הַ⁠כּוֹכָבִֽים	1	The verb **made** that is used earlier in the verse is implied here.

You may be able to use the same construction in your language to express the meaning here. Alternatively, your language may have another way of showing the emphasis. Alternate translation: [I command the water to be full of large groups of living creatures] or [I command there to be large numbers of water animals that live everywhere in the water]
1:20	szof			וְ⁠עוֹף֙ יְעוֹפֵ֣ף	1	The Hebrew word for **birds** can also be more general and refer to “winged creatures,” which includes birds, bats, flying insects and even flying reptiles that are now extinct. Alternate translation: [and let there be birds that fly] or [Also let there be winged creatures that fly]
1:20	obps			עַל־הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ עַל־פְּנֵ֖י רְקִ֥יעַ הַ⁠שָּׁמָֽיִם	1	Alternate translation: [above the earth, through the air] or [across the sky above the earth]

1:21	yks1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לְ⁠מִֽינֵ⁠הֶ֗ם	1	The author assumes that his readers will understand that each different kind of creature has its own distinct kind of offspring.

Alternate translation: [each according to its own kind] or [each that has its own kind of young]

1:22	yiar		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לֵ⁠אמֹ֑ר	1	God blesses the water animals first. If that is not clear, you could make that explicit here in the quote margin or at the beginning of what God says. Alternate translation: [and said first to the water animals]
1:22	v2ge		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	פְּר֣וּ	1	God speaks directly to the water animals using the second person (“you”), then later in the verse speaks about the birds in the third person (**the birds**). For some languages it is necessary to use either second person for both or third person for both, to prevent confusion. Do what is natural and clear in your language.

Some languages have to specify who is being spoken to.
1:26	blpi			נַֽעֲשֶׂ֥ה	1	Most Bible scholars think that the plural pronouns (**us** and **our**) in this verse refer to God and reflect the fact that he is three Persons in one God. So it is best to keep these pronouns plural in your translation. Also, many translations capitalize the first letter of all pronouns that refer to God in order to show him honor and respect. Your translation team needs to decide whether or not you will do that too. Be consistent with your decision as you translate the Bible. Alternate translation: [Now we will make]
1:26	bahl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	אָדָ֛ם	1	The Hebrew word for **man** is used here (and in [verse 27](../01/27.md)) as a collective noun that refers to human beings in general, including both male and female. Alternate translation: [mankind]

1:26	fiz0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	וּ⁠בְ⁠ע֣וֹף הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֗יִם	1	Some translations leave out the phrase **of the sky** because it is strongly implied and may not sound natural in their languages. However, if it is natural in your language, it is best to include this phrase, because the author repeatedly contrasts three large categories of animals in this section: creatures that live on the ground, creatures that swim in the water, and creatures that fly in the sky. Alternate translation: [the birds that fly in the sky]
1:26	vthy			וּ⁠בְ⁠כָל־הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ	1	This refers to the planet earth and everything on it, including water, soil, metals, minerals, and other resources, as well as all the plants and animals.
1:26	x3kc			וּ⁠בְ⁠כָל־הָ⁠רֶ֖מֶשׂ הָֽ⁠רֹמֵ֥שׂ עַל־הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	For some languages it is not natural to repeat **and** or **over** with each item in this list. Consider what is the best way to translate a list like this in your language. Alternate translation: [including every creature that moves on the earth] or [and all the animals that live on the earth]
1:27	zl1a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וַ⁠יִּבְרָ֨א אֱלֹהִ֤ים	1	In this verse God does what he said he was going to do ([verse 26](../01/26.md)). Make sure your translation does not sound like God created mankind twice. Also see how you translated **created** in [verses 1](../01/01.md) and [21](../01/21.md). Alternate translation: [So God made]
1:27	f5z8			אֶת־הָֽ⁠אָדָם֙	1	Be consistent here with how you translated this term in [verse 26](../01/26.md). Alternate translation: [mankind]
1:27	f9uj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	בְּ⁠צֶ֥לֶם אֱלֹהִ֖ים בָּרָ֣א אֹת֑⁠וֹ	1	This clause is the second half of a chiasm (an inverted parallelism) that repeats the first part of [verse 27](../01/27.md) in reverse order, to emphasize that it was in God’s image that human beings were created. Alternate translation: [Yes he made them in his image] or [Indeed he created them to be like himself] or [Yes, God made them to be similar to himself in many ways]
1:27	trl7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	בְּ⁠צֶ֥לֶם אֱלֹהִ֖ים בָּרָ֣א אֹת֑⁠וֹ	1	The pronoun **him** refers to the collective noun **man**, which in this case refers to human beings in general, not just one person.
1:27	n054			זָכָ֥ר וּ⁠נְקֵבָ֖ה בָּרָ֥א אֹתָֽ⁠ם	1	The phrase **male and female** comes first in the Hebrew text in order to emphasize it. Do what is accurate and natural in your language. Also make sure your translation of this verse does not sound like God is both male and female. Alternate translation: [He also made them to be male or female]
1:28	mnzd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר לָ⁠הֶ֜ם אֱלֹהִ֗ים	1	Make sure it is clear in your translation of this quote margin that what God says next is the way that he blessed mankind, not something he said separately from that. Alternate translation: [and said] or [He said]
1:28	lyey		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing	פְּר֥וּ	1	See how you translated **Be fruitful and multiply** in [verse 22](../01/22.md). It may be necessary to translate the phrase in different ways, depending on the context. Alternate translation: [Bear many children] or [You will bear many children]
1:28	xie5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-goal	וּ⁠רְב֛וּ	1	Alternate translation: [so that you and your descendants will multiply greatly in number] or [so that you and your descendants will become very many]

1:28	ytrg			וּ⁠בְ⁠כָל־חַיָּ֖ה הָֽ⁠רֹמֶ֥שֶׂת עַל־הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	This phrase refers generally here to every kind of creature that lives on land. Alternate translation: [and every animal that moves on the land] or [and all the animals that move on the land]
1:29	sqcf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֗ים	1	God is still speaking to the human beings, so it may be necessary to add “also” to this quote margin. Some languages need to specify who is being spoken to. Other languages may leave this quote margin implied, since the same subject (God) is talking to the same people. However, the repeated quote margin in the Hebrew text could show that God paused before continuing or that he is changing the topic, or it may be to emphasize what he says next. So if it is natural to keep the quote margin here in your language, that is best. Alternate translation: [Then God also said to them] or [Then he added]
1:29	a4r5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הִנֵּה֩	1	This word means that what God says next is important and should be given special attention.

1:30	hifc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	אֶת־כָּל־יֶ֥רֶק עֵ֖שֶׂב לְ⁠אָכְלָ֑ה	1	For some languages it is clearer or more natural to put this phrase near the beginning of this verse and say, “In the same way, I give every type of green plant for food to all the wild animals that live on the earth, and all the birds that fly in the sky, and all the other animals that live on the land and breathe air.” Also see how you translated **plant** in [verses 11](../01/11.md), [12](../01/12.md), [29](../01/29.md). Alternate translation: [I give every kind of green plant as food] or [I have given all the green plants as food]

It may be necessary to translate it in different ways, depending on the context. For example, here in [verse 30](../01/30.md) this phrase follows a statement God made, which is different from the other contexts where it follows a command. Alternate translation: [And it was exactly as God said it would be]
1:31	hhg6			וַ⁠יַּ֤רְא אֱלֹהִים֙	1	See how you translated “God saw …” in [verse 4](../01/04.md). Alternate translation: [Then God observed]
1:31	c85e			אֶת־כָּל־אֲשֶׁ֣ר עָשָׂ֔ה	1	This phrase refers to everything that God made during the entire week of Creation, not just on the sixth day. Consider again how you translated **made** (or “make”) in [verses 7](../01/07.md), [16](../01/16.md), [25](../01/25.md), [26](../01/26.md) and [31](../01/31.md). Compare that to how you translated a word that has a similar meaning (“created”) in [verses 1](../01/01.md), [21](../01/21.md) and [27](../01/27.md). Alternate translation: [everything that he had created]
1:31	w4pz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠הִנֵּה	1	This word calls attention to what God is looking at and helps emphasize that what he saw was very good. Alternate translation: [and indeed]

Alternate translation: [Then evening came, and then morning came]
1:31	vsiy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	י֥וֹם הַ⁠שִּׁשִּֽׁי	1	Alternate translation: [and the sixth day ended] or [and that was the end of day six]
2:1	alnx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וַ⁠יְכֻלּ֛וּ הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֥יִם וְ⁠הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ	1	[Verse 1](../02/01.md) is a summary statement that looks back at what God did in [chapter 1](../01/01.md). Make sure that is clear in your language. Also consider whether it is better in your language to use an active or passive clause here, and see how you translated “heavens and earth” in [1:1](../01/01.md). Alternate translation: [So it was that the heavens and the earth were finished by God] or [That is how God concluded making the heavens and the earth]
2:2	lmmc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-ordinal	בַּ⁠יּ֣וֹם הַ⁠שְּׁבִיעִ֔י	1	Make sure it is clear in your translation that God had completed his work by the seventh day and did not work on that day. Also consider again how you translated ordinal numbers in Genesis [1:5](../01/05.md), [8](../01/08.md), [13](../01/13.md), [19](../01/19.md), [23](../01/23.md), [31](../01/31.md); [2:2](../02/02.md). Alternate translation: [By day seven]
2:2	lqw7			וַ⁠יִּשְׁבֹּת֙ בַּ⁠יּ֣וֹם הַ⁠שְּׁבִיעִ֔י מִ⁠כָּל	1	God **rested** in the sense that he stopped his work and did not work on that day. It does not mean he was tired or had lost his strength. Rest is an important theme in the Bible, so you should try to be consistent in how you translate this term here and in other passages, such as [Exodus 23:12](../../exo/23/12.md), [31:17](../../exo/31/17.md) and [Hebrews 4:4](../../heb/04/04.md), [10](../../heb/04/10.md). Part of this theme includes the Hebrew word for Sabbath, which has the same root word as the verb for “rest” and is often translated “resting day.” Alternate translation: [so he ceased on that day from all] or [so on the seventh day he no longer did]
2:2	mtu9			מְלַאכְתּ֖⁠וֹ אֲשֶׁ֣ר עָשָׂ֑ה	1	Alternate translation: [the work that he had been doing]

2:4	m6ic			אֵ֣לֶּה	1	This phrase refers forward to Genesis [2:5–24](../02/05.md) and begins a new section. [Chapter 1](../01/01.md) of Genesis gives an overview of what God did each day of creation week, including that he created human beings on day six. [Chapter 2](../02/01.md) gives more details about how God created Adam and Eve, who were his most important creations. Each chapter emphasizes different parts of the same history; they are not two different histories. Make sure that is clear in your translation. Alternate translation: [These are more details about] or [This is more about] or [What follows gives more details about]
2:4	ptfh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	תוֹלְד֧וֹת הַ⁠שָּׁמַ֛יִם וְ⁠הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ בְּ⁠הִבָּֽרְאָ֑⁠ם	1	The Hebrew text uses a passive construction here to emphasize the heavens and the earth.

Alternate translation: [the history of the heavens and the earth when they were created by God] or [what happened when God created the heavens and the earth]
2:4	i0br			בְּ⁠י֗וֹם	1	Alternate translation: [during the days when] or [During the days when]
2:4	h1ao		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	עֲשׂ֛וֹת & אֶ֥רֶץ וְ⁠שָׁמָֽיִם	1	This clause forms a poetic device called a chiasm with “the heavens and the earth … created” in the first part of this verse. Try to keep the same phrase order in your translation. See how you translated **the heavens** and **the earth** in [1:1](../01/01.md) and [2:1](../02/01.md). Alternate translation: [created the earth and the heavens]

Some languages use a conjunction like “Now” to introduce background information, while other languages do not use a conjunction here. Alternate translation: [Now for a while, there were not yet any shrubs in the fields on the earth] or [For a while, no wild shrubs had yet started growing on the earth]
2:5	gyov			וְ⁠כָל־עֵ֥שֶׂב הַ⁠שָּׂדֶ֖ה טֶ֣רֶם יִצְמָ֑ח	1	See how you translated “plants” in [1:11–12](../01/11.md) and [1:29–30](../01/29.md). Alternate translation: [nor had any other plants started growing yet]

2:5	mdd4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לַֽ⁠עֲבֹ֖ד אֶת־הָֽ⁠אֲדָמָֽה	1	Working the ground includes tasks such as clearing the ground, preparing the soil, planting seeds, and watering the plants. See how you translated **ground** in [1:25](../01/25.md). It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context. Alternate translation: [to farm the land]
2:6	vsou		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וְ⁠אֵ֖ד	1	The Hebrew word for **mist** refers to water in some form, such as water vapor, springs, or streams of water. Also, some translations begin [verse 6](../02/06.md) without **But**. Alternate translation: [But at that time mist] or [At that time mist]
2:6	ytxq			יַֽעֲלֶ֣ה	1	This verb describes a repeated or continuous action. Alternate translation: [seeped up]

2:7	fjjv			וַ⁠יִּיצֶר֩ יְהוָ֨ה אֱלֹהִ֜ים	1	The word **formed** describes what an expert craftsmen would do; it implies artistic skills and design. Alternate translation: [Then Yahweh who is God shaped]
2:7	dbat			אֶת־הָֽ⁠אָדָ֗ם	1	The definite article **the** is used here because this refers to a specific man, the first male human. For many languages it is more natural to use an indefinite article (“a”) to introduce him here or else to not use an article at all. Alternate translation: [the first man]
2:7	pmfi			עָפָר֙	1	The word used here in the Hebrew text is usually translated as **dust** (as in [13:16](../13/16.md), [28:14](../28/14.md)), but it can also be translated as “dirt” (as in [26:15](../26/15.md)) or “mortar/mud/clay” (as in [Leviticus 14:42](../../lev/14/42.md)). The dirt would have been damp enough to be formed or shaped. Alternate translation: [out of mud]
2:7	g3a2			מִן־הָ֣⁠אֲדָמָ֔ה	1	For some languages it may be better to change the order of the phrases in the first half of this verse and say, “Then Yahweh who is God took some dirt from the ground and formed a man out of it,” Also, see how you translated **ground** in [1:25](../01/25.md) and [2:5–6](../02/05.md). You may need to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context. Alternate translation: [from the earth]
2:7	xkca			וַ⁠יִּפַּ֥ח	1	Alternate translation: [and he blew] or [Then he exhaled]
2:7	qzjs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יִּפַּ֥ח בְּ⁠אַפָּ֖י⁠ו נִשְׁמַ֣ת חַיִּ֑ים	1	This refers to God breathing God’s breath into man’s nostrils. As you translate the pronouns **he** and **his** in this verse, make sure it is clear in your language to whom each pronoun refers.
2:8	z5wl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וַ⁠יִּטַּ֞ע יְהוָ֧ה אֱלֹהִ֛ים	1	The clause **Now Yahweh God had planted** could mean: (1) “Now Yahweh God had previously planted” or “Before that, Yahweh God had planted.” This interpretation fits the context of chapter one, which says that God had made all the trees and plants on day three ([1:11–12](../01/11.md)), three days before he created man ([1:26–27](../01/26.md); [2:7](../02/07.md)). Following this view, [verses 8-14](../02/08.md) give background information for what happens in [verses 15-24](../02/15.md). (2) “Then Yahweh God planted” According to this interpretation, God made the Garden of Eden on day six, after he created man.
2:8	npa8			גַּן	1	The man lived in this garden, and there were animals and many trees and other plants in it too, so it was fairly large. Make sure your translation of this term does not refer to something that is too small. Alternate translation: [a large park]
2:8	msch			בְ⁠עֵ֖דֶן מִ⁠קֶּ֑דֶם	1	In this context, the phrase **in the east** could refer to: (1) the eastern part of the region of Eden; or (2) a region east of where Moses lived when he wrote this. It is best, if possible, to keep your translation of this phrase general here (like the Hebrew text). Alternate translation: [in the region called Eden, which was to the east] or [in the eastern part of the land of Eden]
2:8	zpxl			וַ⁠יָּ֣שֶׂם שָׁ֔ם אֶת־הָֽ⁠אָדָ֖ם	1	Alternate translation: [and in that garden he put the man] or [That is where he put the man]
2:8	uvlv			אֲשֶׁ֥ר יָצָֽר	1	See how you translated **formed** in [verse 7](../02/07.md). Alternate translation: [whom he had shaped] or [whom he had created]

2:10	af8y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וְ⁠נָהָרּ֙ יֹצֵ֣א	1	[Verse 10](../02/10.md) gives more of the background information that began in [verse 8](../02/08.md). Many translations omit the conjunction **And** or “Now” here. Alternate translation: [Now a river was flowing] or [A river was flowing]
2:10	pp02			מֵ⁠עֵ֔דֶן	1	The garden was inside the land of Eden, so as the river flowed through Eden, it watered the garden. Alternate translation: [from the land of Eden]
2:10	rcms			לְ⁠הַשְׁק֖וֹת	1	See how you translated “watered” in [verse 6](../02/06.md). Alternate translation: [to irrigate] or [to provide water for] or [that watered]
2:10	wxka			אֶת־הַ⁠גָּ֑ן	1	See how you translated this phrase in [verse 8](../02/08.md). Alternate translation: [the park]
2:10	gpkv			וּ⁠מִ⁠שָּׁם֙	1	Alternate translation: [and from the garden] or [and from Eden]
2:10	h8ke			יִפָּרֵ֔ד וְ⁠הָיָ֖ה לְ⁠אַרְבָּעָ֥ה רָאשִֽׁים	1	This verse could refer to: (1) a river in Eden which was the source river that watered the garden and then divided downstream into the four smaller rivers. Alternate translation: [the river divided into four smaller rivers]; (2) the four rivers being source headwaters that flowed downstream and joined to form the larger river in Eden. Alternate translation: [there were four smaller source rivers that joined together and formed the larger river] If possible, leave your translation ambiguous here (as the Hebrew text does), so that either interpretation is possible.
2:11	ty1t			שֵׁ֥ם הָֽ⁠אֶחָ֖ד	1	Most translations use past tense in [verse 10](../02/10.md), but then use present tense throughout [verses 11-14](../02/11.md). It may be best to use past tense throughout [verses 10-14](../02/10.md), especially since the rivers and places that are named in these verses no longer existed when Genesis was written, because the Flood completely changed the entire surface of the earth; after the Flood, the names of some of those rivers and places were given to new rivers and places. Alternate translation: [The first river is named] or [The first river is]

This was a region of land, because at that time there were no cities. Most translations have “Assyria” here.

Also see how you translated **formed** in verses [2:7–8](../02/07.md) and “dust from the ground” in verse [2:7](../02/07.md).

Some translations first use Adam’s name here in [verse 19](../02/19.md), when he is naming the animals. Many other translations start using his name at the end of [verse 20](../02/20.md). Still other translations wait until [3:20](../03/20.md), when he names Eve, and a few other translations begin in [3:9](../03/09.md), [17](../03/17.md), or 21. Alternate translation: [to Adam]

2:21	xamp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יִּקַּ֗ח	1	Consider whether to use a pronoun or noun here to refer to God. Make sure it is clear in your translation to whom each pronoun is referring at each point in this verse. Alternate translation: [he took out]

Alternate translation: [and used them as aprons to cover their bodies] or [and wore them around their waists to cover their bodies] or [and used them to make clothes for themselves]
3:8	ibyk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַֽ⁠יִּשְׁמְע֞וּ	1	Alternate translation: [Then the man and his wife heard]
3:8	kd3q			אֶת־ק֨וֹל יְהוָ֧ה אֱלֹהִ֛ים מִתְהַלֵּ֥ךְ	1	This phrase could refer to:  (1) the sound of his voice. See UST (2) the sound of God’s footsteps. Alternate translation: [the sound of Yahweh God’s steps as he walked] Either meaning fits the context well and is followed by many translations.
3:8	g02y			בַּ⁠גָּ֖ן	1	Alternate translation: [around in the garden] or [through the garden]
3:8	dipk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לְ⁠ר֣וּחַ הַ⁠יּ֑וֹם	1	This common expression refers to the late afternoon or early evening when there is a breeze blowing and it is cooler. For some languages it is more natural to put this time phrase at the beginning of the sentence. Alternate translation: [late in the afternoon, in the breezy time of the day] or [late that day when there was a cool breeze blowing]
3:8	x1fb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יִּתְחַבֵּ֨א הָֽ⁠אָדָ֜ם וְ⁠אִשְׁתּ֗⁠וֹ	1	If you use **the man and his wife** earlier in this verse in your translation, consider whether or not a pronoun should be used here. Alternate translation: [so they hid themselves] or [so they tried to hide themselves]
3:8	k6j3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	בְּ⁠ת֖וֹךְ עֵ֥ץ הַ⁠גָּֽן	1	Since the garden is already mentioned earlier in [verse 8](../03/08.md), for some languages it may be more natural to be general here and say “there.” Alternate translation: [in the midst of the trees in the garden] or [behind some trees there]
3:8	q6cw			מִ⁠פְּנֵי֙ יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹהִ֔ים	1	Alternate translation: [from Yahweh God] or [from his sight]
3:9	ek33		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	אֶל־הָֽ⁠אָדָ֑ם וַ⁠יֹּ֥אמֶר ל֖⁠וֹ	1	See the note at Genesis [2:19](../02/19.md) about when to start using Adam’s name. Also consider what is the best way to translate this quote margin in your language. Alternate translation: [to the man and asked him] or [to Adam]
3:9	a04v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	אַיֶּֽ⁠כָּה	1	Notice that the word **you** is singular here because God is only addressing the man.
3:10	e1lo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֕אמֶר	1	Alternate translation: [He answered him]
3:10	mb7t			אֶת־קֹלְ⁠ךָ֥ שָׁמַ֖עְתִּי	1	See how you translated **sound** in verse [3:8](../03/08.md). Alternate translation: [I heard your voice] or [I heard the sound of your voice as you walked]
3:10	tr9j			בַּ⁠גָּ֑ן	1	Alternate translation: [through the garden]
3:10	aoxc			וָ⁠אִירָ֛א כִּֽי־עֵירֹ֥ם אָנֹ֖כִי וָ⁠אֵחָבֵֽא	1	Alternate translation: [but I was naked, so I felt afraid and I hid from you] or [but I was naked and afraid that you would see me, so I hid]
3:11	hsb3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֹּ֕אמֶר	1	Make sure your translation of **he** refers to Yahweh here, not the man. Alternate translation: [Then Yahweh God questioned Adam, asking]
3:11	uf06		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	מִ֚י הִגִּ֣יד לְ⁠ךָ֔ כִּ֥י עֵירֹ֖ם אָ֑תָּה	1	The pronoun **you** is still singular here. Alternate translation: [What made you realize that you were naked?] or [How did you find out that you were naked?]
3:11	gi9h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	אֲשֶׁ֧ר צִוִּיתִ֛י⁠ךָ לְ⁠בִלְתִּ֥י אֲכָל־מִמֶּ֖⁠נּוּ	1	For some languages it is more natural to use a direct quote here for Yahweh’s words.
3:12	hp6r			וַ⁠יֹּ֖אמֶר הָֽ⁠אָדָ֑ם	1	Alternate translation: [But the man replied to him] or [The man answered him]
3:12	et6h			הָֽ⁠אִשָּׁה֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר נָתַ֣תָּה עִמָּדִ֔⁠י הִ֛וא	1	The pronoun **she** is emphatic in the Hebrew text. That, along with the position of **The woman** at the beginning of the sentence, shows that the man is strongly emphasizing his blame of the woman. Consider what is the best way to communicate that emphasis in your language. Alternate translation: [The woman whom you put here to live with me, she is the one who] or [It was the woman you gave to me who]
3:12	au82			נָֽתְנָה־לִּ֥⁠י מִן־הָ⁠עֵ֖ץ	1	See how you translated **fruit** in verses [3:1–6](../03/01.md). Alternate translation: [gave me some fruit from that tree]
3:12	z2ws			וָ⁠אֹכֵֽל	1	Alternate translation: [That is why I ate it]
3:13	vvhk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מַה־זֹּ֣את עָשִׂ֑ית	1	God already knew the answer to this question, but he is giving the woman a chance to confess and explain what she did. God’s question probably also implies that he is displeased with what has happened. Alternate translation: [What have you done?] or [Tell me what you have done]
3:13	rhhc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠תֹּ֨אמֶר֙ הָֽ⁠אִשָּׁ֔ה	1	Alternate translation: [Then the woman answered]

3:14	ie75			כִּ֣י עָשִׂ֣יתָ זֹּאת֒	1	Alternate translation: [Since you did that] or [Since you tricked the woman]
3:14	dfy7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אָר֤וּר אַתָּה֙	1	In this context, **cursed** involves God punishing the serpent and its descendants, causing them to suffer by crawling along the ground on their bellies and having a hostile relationship with human beings. Make sure that the way you translate this term does not imply the use of magic. Alternate translation: [you are cursed by me] or [I will cause you to suffer] or [I will punish you]
3:14	qu53			מִ⁠כָּל־הַ⁠בְּהֵמָ֔ה	1	When Adam and Eve sinned and God judged them, the curse and punishment of death and decay also affected everything that was under their authority, including the animals. Here in Genesis [3:14](../03/14.md), God puts a more severe curse on the serpent (and his descendants) than he put on the rest of the animals. See how you translated **livestock** in Genesis [1:24–26](../01/24.md) and [2:20](../02/20.md). Alternate translation: [more harshly than all the tame animals]
3:14	d3v1			וּ⁠מִ⁠כֹּ֖ל חַיַּ֣ת הַ⁠שָּׂדֶ֑ה	1	See how you translated **every living thing of the field** in [verse 1](../03/01.md). Alternate translation: [and more harshly than all the creatures of the fields] or [and more harshly than all the wild animals]
3:14	obw6			עַל־גְּחֹנְ⁠ךָ֣ תֵלֵ֔ךְ	1	Alternate translation: [As a result, you will move on the ground on your stomach]
3:14	aocs			וְ⁠עָפָ֥ר תֹּאכַ֖ל	1	Make sure your translation of **you will eat dust** does not imply that dust or dirt is all the snake will eat. Rather it could mean that dirt will get into his mouth when he eats his food, or it could be an common expression meaning that as he slithers along the ground, his mouth will always be close to the dirt on the ground (a position of humility). Also see how you translated **dust** in Genesis [2:7](../02/07.md). Alternate translation: [and you will eat dirt with your food]
3:14	g32q			כָּל־יְמֵ֥י חַיֶּֽי⁠ךָ	1	Alternate translation: [your entire life]
3:15	ivt7			וְ⁠אֵיבָ֣ה ׀ אָשִׁ֗ית בֵּֽינְ⁠ךָ֙ וּ⁠בֵ֣ין הָֽ⁠אִשָּׁ֔ה וּ⁠בֵ֥ין זַרְעֲ⁠ךָ֖ וּ⁠בֵ֣ין זַרְעָ֑⁠הּ	1	Alternate translation: [I will also cause you and the woman to be enemies with each other, and your offspring and her offspring to also be enemies]
3:15	yfon		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ה֚וּא	1	Here, the pronoun **He** could refer to: (1) the woman’s descendant (Jesus), who would one day come to earth as the Messiah. Alternate translation: [In fact, her offspring] or [In fact, one of her descendants]; (2) the woman’s descendants who will constantly be enemies of the snake’s descendants. If you follow the first interpretation, this would be the first prophecy in the Bible about the Christ (“the Anointed One” or “the Promised Savior King”) who would come to earth and destroy Satan’s power ([Hebrews 2:14](../../heb/02/14.md)). You could include that information in a footnote.
3:15	e3wq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	יְשׁוּפְ⁠ךָ֣ רֹ֔אשׁ וְ⁠אַתָּ֖ה תְּשׁוּפֶ֥⁠נּוּ עָקֵֽב	1	This is figurative language that Satan will harm the Messiah, but the Messiah will destroy him. For some languages it is better to switch the order of these clauses and say, “In fact, you will bruise the heel of one of her descendants, but he will crush your head.” Alternate translation: [will crush your head, and you will bruise his heel]
3:16	vgi1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	הַרְבָּ֤ה אַרְבֶּה֙ עִצְּבוֹנֵ֣⁠ךְ	1	The speaker is repeating forms of the verb **multiply** in order to intensify the idea that it expresses. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: [I will cause you to have much pain] or [I will cause childbirth to be very painful]
3:16	icn7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	בְּ⁠עֶ֖צֶב תֵּֽלְדִ֣י בָנִ֑ים	1	This clause is the second part of a parallelism, the use of two phrases meaning basically the same thing, which emphasizes the pain and suffering that women will experience when they bear children. If possible, it is best to keep both parts of the parallelism in your translation. Alternate translation: [yes, you will suffer much pain when you give birth] or [yes, bearing children will be very painful for you]
3:16	jbk6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וְ⁠אֶל־אִישֵׁ⁠ךְ֙ תְּשׁ֣וּקָתֵ֔⁠ךְ	1	The common expression **your desire will be for your husband** could refer to (1) sexual desire, which is similar to what “desire” means in Song of Songs [7:10](../07/10.md). Alternate translation: [Yet you will still desire to be with your husband] ; or (2) desire for control, which is similar to what **desire** means in Genesis [4:7](../04/07.md). The interpretation that is not followed in your translation could be put in a footnote. Alternate translation: [And you will want to control your husband]
3:16	friw			וְ⁠ה֖וּא יִמְשָׁל־בָּֽ⁠ךְ	1	See how you translated **rule over** in Genesis [1:18](../01/18.md). It may be necessary to translate this term differently here because of the negative context of the curse and the consequences of sin. Alternate translation: [and he will control you] or [and he will lord it over you]
3:17	sq0d			וּ⁠לְ⁠אָדָ֣ם אָמַ֗ר	1	In the Hebrew text, the phrase **to the man** is emphasized. See how you translated a similar case (“to the woman”) in verse [3:16](../03/16.md). Alternate translation: [Next God said to the man] or [Next Yahweh God turned to Adam and said to him]
3:17	dyjb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	כִּֽי־שָׁמַעְתָּ֮ לְ⁠ק֣וֹל אִשְׁתֶּ⁠ךָ֒	1	This phrase means that Adam heard what his wife said to him and then did what she said. Consider what is the best way to communicate that in your language. Alternate translation: [Since you disobeyed me and did what your wife said] or [Since you did what your wife told you to do]
3:17	x2ur		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	אֲשֶׁ֤ר צִוִּיתִ֨י⁠ךָ֙ לֵ⁠אמֹ֔ר לֹ֥א תֹאכַ֖ל מִמֶּ֑⁠נּוּ	1	Consider whether it is better in your language to translate this embedded quote as a direct or indirect quote. Also see how you translated this command in verse [3:3](../03/03.md). Alternate translation: [from which I told you not to eat any fruit]
3:17	ggfr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	אֲרוּרָ֤ה הָֽ⁠אֲדָמָה֙ בַּֽ⁠עֲבוּרֶ֔⁠ךָ	1	For some languages it may be clearer or more natural to break up this long sentence and say, “You did what your wife said and ate fruit from the tree that I commanded you not to eat any fruit from. Because of what you did, I have cursed the ground.” Also see how you translated **cursed** in verse [3:14](../03/14.md). Alternate translation: [the ground is cursed by me because of what you did] or [I have cursed the ground because you sinned]
3:17	wdns		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	בְּ⁠עִצָּבוֹן֙ תֹּֽאכֲלֶ֔⁠נָּה	1	Alternate translation: [As a result, only by painful toil will you eat any food from it] or [As a result, you will have to work very hard and suffer to get enough food to eat]
3:17	o4tu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	כֹּ֖ל יְמֵ֥י חַיֶּֽי⁠ךָ	1	For some languages it is better to put this phrase before the previous clause and say, “As a result, for as long as you live, you will have to work very hard and suffer to grow enough food to eat.” Alternate translation: [every day of your life] or [for your entire life]
3:18	gzbg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וְ⁠ק֥וֹץ וְ⁠דַרְדַּ֖ר תַּצְמִ֣יחַֽ	1	The thorn and thistle plants represent all types of weeds, which are useless and possibly harmful plants. Alternate translation: [In fact, the ground will produce thorn plants and thistle plants and other weeds]
3:18	z3ub			לָ֑⁠ךְ וְ⁠אָכַלְתָּ֖ אֶת־עֵ֥שֶׂב הַ⁠שָּׂדֶֽה	1	The Hebrew text here could mean: (1) “and make it difficult for you to grow enough crops in the fields for food.” or “so that you will have to work very hard in your fields to produce enough crops to eat.” or (2) “so that your crops will not grow well and you will have to eat wild plants that grow in the open fields to survive.” That difference of interpretation comes from the fact that the Hebrew word **fields** can refer to land that people cultivate or to uncultivated land where wild plants grow.
3:19	ewn7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בְּ⁠זֵעַ֤ת אַפֶּ֨י⁠ךָ֙ תֹּ֣אכַל לֶ֔חֶם	1	The phrase “by the sweat of your brow” is a common expression that refers to hard physical labor. Consider whether or not your language has a similar common expression. Also, bread was one of the main food staples for that time and culture, so the Hebrew word for **bread** is used here as a common expression that refers to all food, not just loaves of bread. Consider whether your language does something similar, using one type of food (such as bread, rice or potatoes) to refer to all food in general. Or you could use a general term like “food,” especially if bread is rare or expensive in your language area. Alternate translation: [Only by the sweat of your face will you be able to have enough food to eat] or [You will have to work hard and sweat a lot in order to have enough food to eat]
3:19	n8ba			עַ֤ד שֽׁוּבְ⁠ךָ֙ אֶל־הָ֣⁠אֲדָמָ֔ה	1	Alternate translation: [until you die and again become dust]
3:19	ek0a			כִּ֥י מִמֶּ֖⁠נָּה לֻקָּ֑חְתָּ	1	Alternate translation: [which you were made from by me] or [which I took you from] or [which I made you out of]
3:19	d4o3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	כִּֽי	1	This sentence rephrases and emphasizes what God just said. Alternate translation: [Indeed]
3:19	nwc3			עָפָ֣ר אַ֔תָּה	1	Alternate translation: [your bodies were made by me from dust] or [I made you out of dust]
3:20	wmrp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֧א הָֽ⁠אָדָ֛ם שֵׁ֥ם אִשְׁתּ֖⁠וֹ	1	Some translations use Adam’s name here because he is naming Eve. See what you did in verse [3:17](../03/17.md). Alternate translation: [Then Adam called his wife] or [Then the man gave his wife the name]
3:20	czch		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	חַוָּ֑ה	1	If you include the meaning of Eve’s name in your translation or in a footnote, make sure it is similar to the word in the following clause that has the same meaning (**living**), so that it is clear why Eve was given that name. The meaning of names is important in the Hebrew language, and this translation issue occurs frequently in the book of Genesis.
3:20	alel			כִּ֛י	1	Alternate translation: [He did that because]
3:20	q3ny			הִ֥וא הָֽיְתָ֖ה אֵ֥ם	1	Alternate translation: [she would be the ancestor of]
3:21	nedp			וַ⁠יַּלְבִּשֵֽׁ⁠ם	1	Alternate translation: [and he dressed them] or [and he put the garments on them]
3:22	tgmz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הֵ֤ן	1	This word expresses emotion and calls attention to what God says next. See how you translated this term in Genesis [1:29](../01/29.md). Alternate translation: [Listen]
3:22	m45e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	הָֽ⁠אָדָם֙	1	Throughout [verses 22-24](../03/22.md), **the man** represents mankind, which included both the man and the woman at this point. Make sure your translation communicates that clearly in those verses and does not just refer to Adam. Alternate translation: [the man and his wife] or [mankind] or [human beings]
3:22	jtzi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	הָיָה֙ כְּ⁠אַחַ֣ד מִמֶּ֔⁠נּוּ	1	The pronoun **us** is inclusive because God is talking to himself. Alternate translation: [have become like us]
3:22	u2uz			לָ⁠דַ֖עַת ט֣וֹב וָ⁠רָ֑ע	1	See how you translated this phrase in verse [3:5](../03/05.md) and a similar phrase in Genesis [2:9](../02/09.md)
3:22	z722			וְ⁠עַתָּ֣ה ׀ פֶּן־יִשְׁלַ֣ח יָד֗⁠וֹ וְ⁠לָקַח֙ גַּ֚ם	1	See how you translated “took … fruit” in verse [3:6](../03/06.md). Alternate translation: [So now, they must not be allowed by us to also pick] or [So we must not allow them to also pick] or [So now we must do something so that they can not also pick]
3:22	jc4x			מֵ⁠עֵ֣ץ הַֽ⁠חַיִּ֔ים וְ⁠אָכַ֖ל	1	See how you translated **the tree of life** in Genesis [2:9](../02/09.md). Alternate translation: [fruit from the tree of eternal life and eat some of it]
3:23	x97q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	וַֽ⁠יְשַׁלְּחֵ֛⁠הוּ יְהוָ֥ה אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	Notice that in [verses 22-24](../03/22.md), the words “the man,” and the pronouns **him**, and **he** all refer to mankind, that is, both the man and the woman. Make sure it is clear in your translation here that both humans were sent out of the garden, not just the man. Alternate translation: [Then Yahweh God banished the man and his wife] or [So then Yahweh God forced them to leave]
3:23	kl96			מִ⁠גַּן־עֵ֑דֶן	1	See how you translated this phrase in Genesis [2:15](../02/15.md). Alternate translation: [the garden in the land of Eden]
3:23	hhh0			לַֽ⁠עֲבֹד֙ אֶת־הָ֣⁠אֲדָמָ֔ה	1	See how you translated **work the ground** in Genesis [2:5](../02/05.md) and “work it” in [2:15](../02/15.md). Alternate translation: [to farm the land]
3:23	d3re			אֲשֶׁ֥ר לֻקַּ֖ח מִ⁠שָּֽׁם	1	It does not refer to the exact ground that he was made from. See how you translated **taken from** in verse [3:19](../03/19.md). Alternate translation: [from which they had been taken by him] or [from which he had taken them]
3:24	j8r9			וַ⁠יְגָ֖רֶשׁ אֶת־הָֽ⁠אָדָ֑ם	1	Alternate translation: [Then after God drove the man and his wife out of the garden] or [After God banished them from the garden]
3:24	v4dm			וַ⁠יַּשְׁכֵּן֩	1	Alternate translation: [then he stationed] or [then he placed]
3:24	zcdx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מִ⁠קֶּ֨דֶם לְ⁠גַן־עֵ֜דֶן	1	It is implied that the entrance to the garden is where the cherubim were placed to keep everyone from ever entering the garden again. Consider again how you translated “garden” in Gen [2:8–10](../02/08.md), [2:15–16](../02/15.md) ; [3:1–3](../03/01.md), [3:8](../03/08.md), [3:10](../03/10.md) and [3:23–24](../03/23.md). Alternate translation: [on the east side of the garden at its entrance] or [at the entrance to the garden, which was on its east side]
3:24	gndv			וְ⁠אֵ֨ת לַ֤הַט הַ⁠חֶ֨רֶב֙	1	Alternate translation: [and a fiery sword] or [and a sword made of flames]
3:24	i7zi			הַ⁠מִּתְהַפֶּ֔כֶת	1	It seems that the sword was swinging by itself since there is no mention of anyone holding it. Alternate translation: [that was turning around in all directions] or [that was flashing back and forth]
3:24	orao			לִ⁠שְׁמֹ֕ר אֶת־דֶּ֖רֶךְ	1	Alternate translation: [to keep everyone away from the way that leads to] or [so that no one could go near]

4:1	k9i4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	יָדַ֖ע אֶת־חַוָּ֣ה אִשְׁתּ֑⁠וֹ	1	This phrase is a common expression in Hebrew that means Adam had sexual relations with Eve. Many languages have a similar common expression. Make sure you translate this in a way that is polite and will not offend or embarrass people, especially when read aloud. Alternate translation: [slept with his wife Eve] or [was intimate with his wife Eve]
4:1	um2r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	וַ⁠תַּ֨הַר֙ וַ⁠תֵּ֣לֶד	1	Translate this clause in a way that will not embarrass people, especially when read aloud. Alternate translation: [so that she became pregnant and later gave birth to]
4:1	a1ox		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	אֶת־קַ֔יִן	1	You could include the meaning of Cain’s name in your translation or in a footnote. See what you did for a similar case in Genesis [3:20](../03/20.md).
4:1	ww1b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	וַ⁠תֹּ֕אמֶר קָנִ֥יתִי	1	This sentence explains how **Cain** got his name. Eve’s statement, **I have obtained a man with Yahweh** could mean: (1) that Yahweh enabled her to have a child. Alternate translation: [They named him that because Eve had said, “I have gotten]; (2) that Eve has produced a son. Alternate translation: [They named him that because Eve had said, “I have produced] If you include the meaning of Cain’s name earlier in this verse in your translation or in a footnote, make sure it matches your choice here so that it is clear why he was given that name.
4:1	gohm			אִ֖ישׁ	1	For some languages it is confusing to refer to a newborn baby as a man. Do what is clear and natural in your language. Alternate translation: [a male child] or [a boy] or [a baby boy]
4:1	tfqh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	אֶת־יְהוָֽה	1	For some languages it is more natural to put this phrase earlier in this sentence and say, “With Yahweh’s help I have obtained a son!” or “Yahweh has enabled me to get a son!” Alternate translation: [with help from Yahweh!]
4:2	gqfn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠תֹּ֣סֶף לָ⁠לֶ֔דֶת	1	The idiom **continued on** may mean that Cain and Abel were twins, or Abel may have been born sometime later, when Eve became pregnant again. If possible, translate [verse 2](../04/02.md) in a way that allows for either interpretation of **continued on**. Alternate translation: [Then she also gave birth to] or [After that, Eve gave birth to]
4:2	i71z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	אֶת־אָחִ֖י⁠ו	1	Some languages have a specific term for “younger brother” that can be used here.
4:2	xfso		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	וַֽ⁠יְהִי־הֶ֨בֶל֙	1	This sentence introduces background information for what happens next. Consider what is the best way to begin this sentence in your language. Also, it is implied here that the boys had grown up to be adults.

4:8	dhvy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	אֶל־הֶ֣בֶל אָחִ֑י⁠ו	1	This sentence is what the Hebrew text has. Instead of that text, some ancient manuscripts and translations (including the Samaritan Pentateuch, Septuagint, Latin Vulgate, and Syriac) and many modern translations have: “Then Cain said to Abel his brother, “Let’s go out to the field and work together.” ” or “Then Cain invited his brother Abel to go out to the field with him to work.” Some translation teams follow the way this verse is translated in a well-known translation, such as in the national language or in a neighboring language. Decide what to do in your translation. The textual variant that you do not use in your translation could be put in a footnote. Alternate translation: [with his brother Abel]
4:8	bkk1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַֽ⁠יְהִי֙ בִּ⁠הְיוֹתָ֣⁠ם בַּ⁠שָּׂדֶ֔ה	1	For some languages it is necessary to make explicit that Cain and Abel actually went to the field. Alternate translation: [So they went out to the field to work together, but while they were there]
4:8	ms2c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	הֶ֣בֶל אָחִ֑י⁠ו	1	The Hebrew text keeps repeating the phrase **Abel his brother** to emphasize the seriousness of Cain’s crime.

Also, each translation team needs to decide how they will handle numbers in the Hebrew text so that readers will not confuse those numbers with verse numbers. For example, it may be best to use words for single and double-digit numbers in the text. Be consistent with how you spelled the name **Lamech** in [verses 18-19](../04/18.md), [23-24](../04/23.md).

5:1	c3vh			בִּ⁠דְמ֥וּת אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	God created mankind to be like himself in certain ways, but not to be exactly like him in every way (Genesis [1:26–27](../01/26.md)). Alternate translation: [in his own likeness]

Many teams use numerals, for example, **130** here in [verse 3](../05/03.md), especially if the target language has a complicated counting system. Other teams prefer to use words, for example, “one hundred and thirty” here. Be consistent in what you do throughout your translation. Alternate translation: [When Adam had lived 130 years, he had a son] or [When Adam was 130 years old, he fathered a son]

So if you use a conjunction here, make sure your translation does not sound like [verse 6](../05/06.md) happened after Adam died. Alternate translation: [After Seth had lived 105 years] or [After Seth was 105 years old]
5:6	ac8w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יּ֖וֹלֶד אֶת־אֱנֽוֹשׁ	1	You could make it explicit in your translation or in a footnote that Enosh was a son.

For example, many translation teams use words for single and double-digit numbers, but use numerals for larger numbers. This strategy helps prevent confusion with verse numbers. This is especially true in translations that use a large font size for verse numbers so that people doing group Bible study can easily be in the same verse together. Alternate translation: [After Kenan had lived seventy years] or [After Kenan was seventy years old]

5:29	fqyr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	נֹ֖חַ	1	If you include the meaning of Noah’s name in your translation or in a footnote, make sure it matches what Lamech says about him in the following quote so that it is clear why he was given that name.
5:29	d1z6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לֵ⁠אמֹ֑ר	1	What Lamech says next is the reason why he named his son Noah. Make sure that is clear in your translation. Alternate translation: [He named him that because he had said about him]

Consider what is the best way to communicate that in your language. Alternate translation: [from the difficult labor and work we have to do with our hands] or [from the agonizing work that we have to do]
5:29	omyc			מִן־הָ֣⁠אֲדָמָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר אֵֽרְרָ֖⁠הּ יְהוָֽה	1	Alternate translation: [as we farm the ground that Yahweh has cursed]
5:30	d607			וַֽ⁠יְחִי־לֶ֗מֶךְ אַֽחֲרֵי֙ הוֹלִיד֣⁠וֹ אֶת־נֹ֔חַ	1	Consider again how you translated verses in this chapter that are similar in structure to this verse; see [verses 7](../05/07.md), [10](../05/10.md), [13](../05/13.md), [16](../05/16.md), [19](../05/19.md), [26](../05/26.md), [30](../05/30.md), and part of [verses 4](../05/04.md) and [22](../05/22.md). Alternate translation: [After he fathered Noah, he lived] or [After Noah was born, Lamech lived]

Alternate translation: [And Noah saw his 500th year] or [Noah turned 500 years old]
5:32	uzva		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יּ֣וֹלֶד נֹ֔חַ אֶת־שֵׁ֖ם אֶת־חָ֥ם וְ⁠אֶת־יָֽפֶת	1	Noah’s sons were not triplets, but were born in different years after Noah was 500 years old. The way you translate this verse should allow for that meaning.
5:32	yohb			וַ⁠יּ֣וֹלֶד נֹ֔חַ	1	Consider again how you translated **fathered** in this chapter; see [verses 4](../05/04.md), [6-7](../05/06.md), [9-10](../05/09.md), [12-13](../05/12.md), [15-16](../05/15.md), [18-19](../05/18.md), [25-26](../05/25.md), [28](../05/28.md), [30](../05/30.md), [32](../05/32.md). Alternate translation: [he fathered]
6:1	pmgg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	וַֽ⁠יְהִי֙	1	The author is using **And it happened** to describe something that was ongoing. This provides the background for other events he will describe that began to happen during this time. Connect this clause to the story in a way that makes it clear in your language that this clause is describing something that was ongoing in the background. \nThe events in Genesis [6:1–2](../06/01.md) started happening long before the events in [5:32](../05/32.md), so the way your translation begins this verse should allow for that meaning and not begin with a sequence word like “Then.”
6:1	as12		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	כִּֽי	1	Alternate translation: [that as]
6:1	mezb			הָֽ⁠אָדָ֔ם	1	See how you translated **mankind** in Genesis [5:1–2](../05/01.md). Alternate translation: [human beings]

6:2	vn76			וַ⁠יִּרְא֤וּ בְנֵי־הָֽ⁠אֱלֹהִים֙	1	Alternate translation: [Then those girls grew up, and the sons of God saw]
6:2	znk3			וַ⁠יִּרְא֤וּ & אֶת־בְּנ֣וֹת הָֽ⁠אָדָ֔ם כִּ֥י טֹבֹ֖ת הֵ֑נָּה	1	Alternate translation: [saw that the daughters of human beings were beautiful] or [saw that those young women were beautiful] or [saw that they were very beautiful]
6:2	qnty			וַ⁠יִּקְח֤וּ לָ⁠הֶם֙ נָשִׁ֔ים מִ⁠כֹּ֖ל אֲשֶׁ֥ר בָּחָֽרוּ	1	Alternate translation: [so they married any of them that they wanted to marry]
6:3	fdyv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר יְהוָ֗ה	1	The implication is that Yahweh is speaking to himself. Only make implied information explicit in your translation if it is necessary to prevent wrong meaning or if your language’s grammar requires it so that your translation is easier to read and understand. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [So Yahweh said to himself]
6:3	n5w7			רוּחִ֤⁠י	1	The words **My Spirit** could mean: (1) God is speaking of his spirit or saying “I,” which is a way of God referring to himself (Genesis [1:2](../01/02.md) is similar) (2) that God is referring to his breath that gives life (as in Genesis [2:71](../02/71.md)). If the text is not translated literally, the literal text should be put in a footnote.
6:3	lxhr			לֹֽא־יָד֨וֹן & בָֽ⁠אָדָם֙ לְ⁠עֹלָ֔ם	1	The phrase **will not strive with mankind forever** could mean: (1) that God will not contend with human beings forever. Alternate translation: [will not put up with human beings forever] or (2) that God will not remain with human beings forever. Alternate translation: [will not dwell among humans forever] The interpretation that is not used in your translation could be put in a footnote.
6:3	nsna		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בְּ⁠שַׁ⁠גַּ֖ם ה֣וּא בָשָׂ֑ר	1	The word **flesh** is used here as a common expression that means human beings are “mortal” (that is, their bodies will die) and that they are “sinful.” The two meanings are interrelated since it is because of sin that their bodies die. In this context, the focus is on their corrupt behavior, which is the reason God will send a flood. Alternate translation: [because they are very sinful] or [because they are only sinful mortals]
6:3	u5p6			וְ⁠הָי֣וּ יָמָ֔י⁠ו מֵאָ֥ה וְ⁠עֶשְׂרִ֖ים שָׁנָֽה	1	This sentence could mean: (1) that mankind will have 120 years to repent. Alternate translation: [I will give them 120 years to repent]; (2) that 120 years will be the maximum lifespan. Alternate translation: [From now on, they will have no longer than 120 years.] The first interpretation seems to best fit the context here of God announcing his plan to judge mankind for their sin ([verse 7](../06/07.md)). This would mean that Noah was 480 years old when God said this (about 20 years before he started having sons; Genesis [5:32](../05/32.md)), since the flood came when he was 600 years old (Genesis [7:6](../07/06.md)); you could put some of that information in a footnote. The second interpretation does not fit with the fact that after God said this, many people lived much longer than 120 years, so it does not seem likely that length of life was his meaning here.
6:4	ynoy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate	הַ⁠נְּפִלִ֞ים	1	Most translations transliterate (borrow or copy) the Hebrew word **Nephilim** here, treating it as a name. The word means “fallen ones” and probably refers to their fallen (sinful) spiritual state. The Nephilim were the descendants of the sons of God and the daughters of mankind. The only other time in the Bible that the Nephilim are mentioned is centuries later in [Numbers 13:32–33](../../num/13/32.md), where they are identified as evil giants. Based on that, some translations translate “the Nephilim” as “giants” here in Genesis [6:4](../06/04.md). Alternate translation: [Giants called the Nephilim] or [Giants]

You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [Then he said to himself]

Alternate translation: [Of all the people living at that time, Noah was the only one whom God considered blameless] or (2) He had a spotless reputation among his contemporaries. The phrase **without blemish** is often used in the Bible to describe animals that have no defects. Here it is used as a common expression meaning that Noah was blameless or faultless in an ethical or moral sense or that he had good integrity, but it does not mean that he was totally sinless. Consider whether your language has a similar common expression that would work well here.

6:14	altn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate	תֵּבַ֣ת	1	The term ark is a Latin word that many translations use for the name of the structure that Noah built. The word refers to a chest or box that is closed on all sides, including the top. In this case, the ark was a very large boat that people and many animals lived in for a year. It had no motor, no oars, no sail, and no rudder. If Noah’s boat is already well-known as the ark in your language area, you may choose to borrow the word “ark” as the name of this boat. Decide what is best for your translation. Alternate translation: [a very large houseboat]
6:14	jqp0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	עֲצֵי־גֹ֔פֶר	1	It is not certain what kind of wood this was, so many translations transliterate (copy or borrow) the Hebrew word **gopher**.

6:14	ch1i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	בַּ⁠כֹּֽפֶר	1	The Hebrew word **covering** is general and does not specify what kind of waterproofing material is being used. However, many translations are more specific than that here and refer to “pitch” or “tar” or some other material made from tree resin or sap that can seal a boat well and keep it from leaking. Alternate translation: [with pitch to keep water out] or [with pitch to keep the boat from leaking]
6:15	qrn8			וְ⁠זֶ֕ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר תַּֽעֲשֶׂ֖ה אֹתָ֑⁠הּ	1	Alternate translation: [Build the ark with these dimensions] or [You must build the ark like this:]

You can: (1) translate cubits into meters or feet, and put the literal text in a footnote; or (2) keep **cubits** in the main text (so that the numbers 300, 50, and [30](../06/30.md) are kept) and put what that equals in meters or feet in a footnote. Alternate translation: [It must be 140 meters long, 23 meters wide, and 14 meters high] or [It must be 450 feet long, 75 feet wide, and 45 feet high]

See the note about **cubit** in verse [6:15](../06/15.md). Alternate translation: [Build a skylight for the boat by finishing the sides of the ark to within one cubit below the top of the ark] or [Build a half-meter high window between the top of the sides of the ark and its roof all the way around, to let light and air in]

6:17	cskc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	כָּל־בָּשָׂ֗ר	1	This phrase is general here and includes people and animals, so you may need to translate the phrase differently here from what you did earlier in [verses 12-13](../06/12.md) (where the focus seems to be on people). Alternate translation: [all the beings] or [every creature]

Alternate translation: [will breathe out its last breath!] or [will perish!]
6:18	dkie		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וַ⁠הֲקִמֹתִ֥י	1	The word **establish** means to deliberately and formally put something into effect. Alternate translation: [However, I will make] or [However, I will set up]

The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. It may be clearer in your language to connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: [Also, from every kind of thing that lives, yes, from every kind of animal]

9:3	qntp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	לָ⁠כֶ֥ם יִהְיֶ֖ה לְ⁠אָכְלָ֑ה	1	For some languages it is more natural to change the order of this sentence and say, “You may now have/eat any kind of living creature that moves, for food.” or “I now permit you to eat every kind of living creature that moves.” Alternate translation: [is available for you to eat as food]
9:3	h0u4			כְּ⁠יֶ֣רֶק עֵ֔שֶׂב	1	Consider again how you translated **green plants** in Genesis [1:30](../01/30.md) and how you translated **plants** in Genesis [1:11–12](../01/11.md), [1:19](../01/19.md), [2:5](../02/05.md), [3:18](../03/18.md) . and [9:3](../09/03.md). Alternate translation: [plants to eat]
9:3	lqhk			נָתַ֥תִּי לָ⁠כֶ֖ם אֶת־כֹּֽל	1	Make sure that the way you translate this phrase means that God is now permitting people to eat both plants and animals. Alternate translation: [now I give you everything for food] or [so now I permit you to eat everything] or [so now I permit you to eat both plants and animals]
9:4	ifut		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions	אַךְ	1	Make sure it is clear in your translation that God is not contradicting himself here, but rather he is giving an exception to what he said in [verse 3](../09/03.md). God is putting a limit on the way that people may eat meat. Alternate translation: [You may eat meat, but not when it still has the blood of life in it]
9:4	lov7			בָּשָׂ֕ר & לֹ֥א תֹאכֵֽלוּ	1	Alternate translation: [you must never eat animal flesh]
9:4	goma			בְּ⁠נַפְשׁ֥⁠וֹ דָמ֖⁠וֹ	1	Since life is in the blood, God did not want people to eat meat that still had its blood in it. Rather he wanted them to drain it out first before they cooked it (also see Deuteronomy [12:16, 23](../12/16.md)). You could put that information in a footnote. Alternate translation: [that still has its life in it, which is in its blood] or [with its blood in it, which made it live] or [that still has its lifeblood in it]
9:5	rp2l			וְ⁠אַ֨ךְ אֶת־דִּמְ⁠כֶ֤ם לְ⁠נַפְשֹֽׁתֵי⁠כֶם֙ אֶדְרֹ֔שׁ	1	Alternate translation: [Also, I will definitely require an accounting for your lifeblood]
9:5	ok4h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	מִ⁠יַּ֥ד כָּל־חַיָּ֖ה	1	In this verse, the phrase **the hand of** refers to the animal or the person that is responsible for killing someone. Alternate translation: [From any animal that kills a person]

9:6	i3ix		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	שֹׁפֵךְ֙	1	The first half of [verse 6](../09/06.md) repeats and summarizes [verse 5](../09/05.md). These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. Alternate translation: [Yes, if anyone]
9:6	n8bs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	שֹׁפֵךְ֙ דַּ֣ם	1	The phrase **shedding the blood of** is a common expression that means deliberately killing someone. Blood is an important concept in this passage and throughout the Bible, so if possible, it is best to keep this term in your translation. If that is not possible, you should put the literal text in a footnote. Alternate translation: [Yes, if anyone kills] or [Whoever takes the life of]
9:6	tey3			הָֽ⁠אָדָ֔ם	1	Alternate translation: [a person] or [another human being] or [someone]
9:6	xvtg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	בָּֽ⁠אָדָ֖ם דָּמ֣⁠וֹ יִשָּׁפֵ֑ךְ	1	For some languages it is more natural to put this clause first in this verse and say, “That’s right, you must put to death anyone who murders a human being, because I, God, made human beings in my own image.” Alternate translation: [Yes, by people the blood of this man must be shed]
9:6	xbls		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	בָּֽ⁠אָדָ֖ם דָּמ֣⁠וֹ יִשָּׁפֵ֑ךְ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who does the action, the context suggests that it is God. Alternate translation: [people must execute him] or [people must put him to death] or [mankind must execute him]
9:6	c56p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	כִּ֚י בְּ⁠צֶ֣לֶם אֱלֹהִ֔ים עָשָׂ֖ה אֶת־הָ⁠אָדָֽם	1	Make sure it is clear in your translation that God is referring to himself in this clause. See how you translated a similar clause in Genesis [1:27](../01/27.md). Alternate translation: [because I, God made people in my own image] or [because I created human beings to be like myself]
9:7	uion		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠אַתֶּ֖ם	1	In the Hebrew text, the pronoun **you** is emphatic and has an emphatic position in the sentence (before the verb) to introduce a new topic.

9:7	mt4l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	פְּר֣וּ	1	See how you translated **be fruitful and multiply** in [verse 1](../09/01.md). Alternate translation: [bear many children]

9:9	ycb0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וַ⁠אֲנִ֕י הִנְנִ֥⁠י	1	See how you translated **behold** in Genesis [1:29](../01/29.md), [4:14](../04/14.md), and [6:13, 17](../06/13.md). It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context. Alternate translation: [Now listen carefully to me: I]
9:9	pujm			מֵקִ֛ים	1	See how you translated “establish my covenant with” in Genesis [6:18](../06/18.md), and see the note about that there. Alternate translation: [am instituting] or [am setting up]

It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: [my special agreement with you and your descendants who come after you] or [my covenant between me and you and your offspring]
9:10	tzzr			וּֽ⁠בְ⁠כָל־חַיַּ֥ת הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ	1	Alternate translation: [and all the other living things on the earth] or [and all the wild animals]
9:10	mxmq			מִ⁠כֹּל֙ יֹצְאֵ֣י הַ⁠תֵּבָ֔ה	1	The phrases **from all** and **to every** are used to emphasize that all the animals are included in God’s covenant. Consider what is the best way to express that in your language. Alternate translation: [That includes all those that went out of the ark]

9:11	euoi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	This phrase refers here to everything that lives on the earth. Alternate translation: [life on the earth] or [all living creatures on the earth]
9:12	b7sv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר אֱלֹהִ֗ים	1	God is still talking to the same people, but a quote margin, **Then God said**, is added here to emphasize the new topic, **the sign of the covenant**. For some languages it is more natural to leave this quote margin implied and just have a paragraph break. See what you did for a similar case in verse [9:8](../09/08.md). Alternate translation: [Then God also said to them] or [Then God added]
9:12	htun			זֹ֤את אֽוֹת־הַ⁠בְּרִית֙ אֲשֶׁר־אֲנִ֣י נֹתֵ֗ן	1	Alternate translation: [This is how I will remind everyone that I have made this covenant]

9:18	h3vw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠חָ֕ם ה֖וּא	1	The pronoun **he** is emphatic here, emphasizing that Ham was the father of Canaan, who is probably mentioned here because he was well known as the ancestor of the Canaanites and the one whom the land of Canaan was named after.

The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “who was a farmer, began farming and planted” or “who was a farmer, was the first man to plant” or (2) “began to be a farmer and planted” or “became a farmer and planted” Alternate translation: [Now later on, Noah]
9:20	utl1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כָּֽרֶם	1	It is implied that Noah made wine from the grapes ([verse 21](../09/21.md)). If necessary, you could make that explicit here. Also, if grapes are not known in your language area, you could say “vines with a fruit called grapes,” or you could put in a footnote information about grapes, including how they are squeezed and how the juice is fermented to make wine. Alternate translation: [some grapevines and made wine from the grapes] or [a field with grapevines. And he made wine from the grapes]
9:21	w1ox			וַ⁠יֵּ֥שְׁתְּ מִן־הַ⁠יַּ֖יִן	1	Alternate translation: [One day he drank a lot of the wine]

9:25	tt6u			יִֽהְיֶ֥ה	1	Alternate translation: [I proclaim that he will be]
9:25	dvbz			עֶ֥בֶד עֲבָדִ֖ים	1	The Hebrew word here can mean either **slave** or “servant.” Slaves in the Old Testament were usually treated well and were not much different than servants, sometimes even becoming like members of their owner’s family. But they were of lower status than their masters, which is part of how Ham’s family is being cursed. Alternate translation: [the lowest slave]
9:25	dnvn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	לְ⁠אֶחָֽי⁠ו	1	[Verses 26](../09/26.md) and [27](../09/27.md) show that **his brothers** probably refers here to Shem and Japheth (who were Canaan’s uncles) and their descendants.

9:26	a9c8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing	בָּר֥וּךְ יְהֹוָ֖ה	1	Although many English translations have “Blessed be” here instead of **Praised be**, the word used in the Hebrew text means “praise” when people are acting towards God (as here), and it means “bless” when God is acting towards people (as in Genesis [1:28](../01/28.md); [5:2](../05/02.md); [9:1](../09/01.md)).

Alternate translation: [after the time that the flood began] or [from the beginning of the flood]

Also, many translations that use “were” (and other past tense verbs) in [verses 2-19](../10/02.md) and [21-30](../10/21.md) use **are** here (and in [verses 31](../10/31.md) and [32](../10/32.md)).

11:6	zesy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר יְהוָ֗ה	1	Consider what is the best way to refer to Yahweh here in your language. Alternate translation: [And he said (to himself)] or [He said]
11:6	h94b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הֵ֣ן	1	This term calls attention to what Yahweh says next. Consider what is the best way to do that in your language. Alternate translation: [Listen]
11:6	emr9			וְ⁠שָׂפָ֤ה אַחַת֙ לְ⁠כֻלָּ֔⁠ם	1	See how you translated **have one language** in verse [11:1](../11/01.md). Alternate translation: [and they all share the same language]
11:6	jn1z			וְ⁠זֶ֖ה הַחִלָּ֣⁠ם לַ⁠עֲשׂ֑וֹת	1	Alternate translation: [This is only the start of what they could do together]

Consider what is the best way to translate this in your language. Alternate translation: [nothing that they plan to do will be impossible for them] or [anything they attempt to do will be possible for them] or [they can do whatever they try to do]

11:7	ab2t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	נֵֽרְדָ֔ה & שָׁ֖ם	1	Most Bible scholars think the plural pronoun **us** refers here to God and the fact that he is three Persons in one God. So it is best to keep this plural pronoun in your translation. See what you did for similar pronouns in Genesis [1:26](../01/26.md). Alternate translation: [let us go to them]
11:7	b6e9			וְ⁠נָבְלָ֥ה & שְׂפָתָ֑⁠ם	1	Alternate translation: [and scramble their language]
11:7	qlnr			אֲשֶׁר֙ לֹ֣א יִשְׁמְע֔וּ	1	Alternate translation: [making them unable to understand] or [so that they cannot understand]

11:8	fvq8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	הָ⁠עִֽיר	1	For some languages it is better to change the order of clauses in this verse (so that events are in the order that they happened) and say, “In that way, Yahweh caused the people to stop building the city and the tower and to move away from each other, so that eventually they lived all over the world.” Alternate translation: [the city and the tower]
11:9	grok			קָרָ֤א שְׁמָ⁠הּ֙	1	Alternate translation: [people named the city] or [the name of that city is] or [the city was named]
11:9	flf8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	בָּבֶ֔ל	1	If you include the meaning of **Babel** here in your translation or in a footnote, be consistent with the way you translate **confused** later in this verse and in [verse 7](../11/07.md).
11:9	go0s			כִּי־שָׁ֛ם & יְהוָ֖ה	1	Alternate translation: [because it was in that city that Yahweh]
11:9	cnun			בָּלַ֥ל	1	Alternate translation: [scrambled] or [confounded]

Alternate translation: [Two years after the flood began, when Shem was 100 years old, he had a son named Arpachshad]

Alternate translation: [After Shem had Arpachshad, Shem lived] or [After Arpachshad was born, Shem lived]
11:11	newn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	חֲמֵ֥שׁ מֵא֖וֹת שָׁנָ֑ה	1	See how you translated Genesis [5:7](../05/07.md) , which has the same sentence structure as [11:11](../11/11.md). For some languages, it may be more natural to change the clause order of this sentence and say, “Shem lived 500 more years after Arpachshad was born, and he fathered other sons and daughters.” Do what is best in your language throughout this chapter. Alternate translation: [500 more years]
11:11	lc2z			בָּנִ֖ים וּ⁠בָנֽוֹת	1	Alternate translation: [more sons as well as daughters]
11:12	cx5o			וְ⁠אַרְפַּכְשַׁ֣ד חַ֔י חָמֵ֥שׁ וּ⁠שְׁלֹשִׁ֖ים שָׁנָ֑ה	1	Make sure that your translation of this clause does not mean that Arpachshad only lived to be thirty-five years old. Also, throughout this chapter, be consistent with how you have decided to handle numbers in the Bible. For example, many translation teams use words for single and double-digit numbers, but use numerals for larger numbers. This strategy helps prevent confusion with verse numbers. This is especially true in translations that use a large font size for verse numbers so that people doing group Bible study can easily see the numbers and be in the same verse together. See what you did in [chapter 5](../05/01.md). Alternate translation: [When Arpachshad had lived 35 years] or [When Arpachshad was 35 years old]

In fact, Abram was not born until Terah was at least 130 years old ([11:321](../11/321.md), [12:4–5](../12/04.md); Acts [7:4](../07/04.md)), and he was probably Terah’s youngest son. Abram is listed first (instead of Haran or Nahor) probably because of his importance as the one whom Yahweh made His covenant with. Some of this information could be put in a footnote. Alternate translation: [After Terah had lived 70 years, his wife birthed three sons. ] or [After Terah turned 70 years old]

What follows is a history about Terah’s descendants (especially Abram); it is not a genealogy or list of names. See how you translated a similar phrase in Genesis [6:91](../06/91.md). Alternate translation: [This is the account about Terah and his family:]

The author uses the word **But** here to indicate a strong contrast between what was expected and what happened. In your translation, indicate this strong contrast in a way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [But on the way there, they came to the city of Haran, and] or [But along the way, when they stopped at the city of Haran]

In other words, God’s promise in this verse is part of his wonderful news (the gospel message) for all people (Galatians [3:8–9](../03/08.md)) and is a prophecy about the Messiah, who was one of Abraham’s descendants (Matthew [1:1](../01/01.md), Genesis [22:18](../22/18.md), and Galatians [3:16](../03/16.md)). God blessed all people on earth by sending his Son Jesus (the Messiah/Christ) to die in their place and pay for all their sins (John [3:16–18](../03/16.md), 1 Timothy [2:3–6](../02/03.md)), so that they could have a close relationship with him/God and be part of his family forever. God repeats this great promise in Genesis [18:18](../18/18.md); [22:18](../22/18.md); [26:4](../26/04.md); [28:14](../28/14.md). You could put some of that information in a footnote.

12:6	ep53		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וַ⁠יַּעֲבֹ֤ר אַבְרָם֙	1	Abram is the only one named here because he is in focus. However, your translation should not sound like he traveled alone in [verse 6](../12/06.md). Also make sure that the way you begin this verse in your translation fits with the way you ended [verse 5](../12/05.md). Alternate translation: [Abram went] or [Abram and his family went] or [they went]
12:6	o804			בָּ⁠אָ֔רֶץ	1	See how you translated **land** in [verse 5](../12/05.md). Alternate translation: [through that land]

12:6	wf66		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	עַ֖ד אֵל֣וֹן מוֹרֶ֑ה	1	**Moreh** is probably the name of the person who owned the land where the terebinth tree was. A terebinth tree is a large, broadleaf, flowering tree in the cashew family that can grow to a height of 5 to 12 meters (16 to 40 feet). The Hebrew words for “oak” and **terebinth** are similar, so many translations (including LXX) translate this as “oak tree” here. Notice, however, that oak trees and terebinth trees are from two different families of trees.
12:6	aje0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	וְ⁠הַֽ⁠כְּנַעֲנִ֖י אָ֥ז בָּ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	For some languages it is clearer and more natural to put the time phrase **at that time** first in this sentence. Alternate translation: [At that time the Canaanites were still living in that region]
12:7	nqjy			וַ⁠יֵּרָ֤א יְהוָה֙ אֶל־אַבְרָ֔ם	1	Notice that the text does not specify in what form or in what way God appeared to Abram, so your translation should not do that either. Also, Yahweh’s promise in [verse 7](../12/07.md) to give Canaan to Abram’s descendants contrasts with the fact that the Canaanites were still occupying that region ([verse 6](../12/06.md)). Alternate translation: [Then Yahweh made his presence known to Abram] or [but Yahweh visited Abram]

However, for some languages it may be clearer and more natural to change the order of the clauses and say, “I will give this land to your descendants.” Alternate translation: [I will give this land to your offspring]

Alternate translation: [and put up his tents there] or [They set up their camp]
12:8	r71q			בֵּֽית־אֵ֤ל מִ⁠יָּם֙ וְ⁠הָ⁠עַ֣י מִ⁠קֶּ֔דֶם	1	Alternate translation: [Bethel was to the west of them and the town of Ai was to the east]

12:9	yypr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	הַ⁠נֶּֽגְבָּ⁠ה	1	The Hebrew word **Negev** can mean “south” or “dry country,” so some translations translate the meaning. But most translations transliterate the Hebrew name (as **Negev** or “Negeb”) as they do with other names in the Bible. Alternate translation: [south toward the Negev Wilderness] or [southward until they reached the Southern Wilderness]
12:10	glm2			וַ⁠יְהִ֥י	1	This clause gives the setting for the rest of the sentence. Translate this in a way that is natural in your language.

12:10	vjke		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	בָּ⁠אָ֑רֶץ	1	For some languages it may be more natural to put **in the land** near the beginning of this verse and say, “Now in that region there was a famine that was so severe that Abram and his family left there and went down to the country of Egypt to live for a while.” Alternate translation: [in that land] or [in the Negev Desert so they could not survive there]

Alternate translation: [and my life will be spared by them] or [and they will spare my life] or [and they will let me live]
12:14	ajxi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כְּ⁠ב֥וֹא אַבְרָ֖ם מִצְרָ֑יְמָ⁠ה	1	Although Abram is in focus here, your translation should not sound like he was traveling alone. Alternate translation: [When Abram and his family entered the land of Egypt]

15:10	qlm4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בַּ⁠תָּ֔וֶךְ	1	The author assumes that readers will know that Abram probably cut the animals down the middle lengthwise, which means that each half had one front leg and one back leg. You could say that explicitly if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [into two parts lengthwise]

15:15	lnj7		figs-rpronouns	וְ⁠אַתָּ֛ה	1	For emphasis in the Hebrew text, Moses places the pronoun **you** in an emphatic position in the sentence (before the verb) to change the topic. This adds emphasis to what he is saying. If your language uses explicit pronouns for emphasis, you may want to use that construction in your translation. Other languages may have other ways of bringing out this emphasis. Do what is clear and natural in your language. Alternate translation: [Now as for you]
15:15	yeva		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	תָּב֥וֹא אֶל־אֲבֹתֶ֖י⁠ךָ בְּ⁠שָׁל֑וֹם	1	This clause is a euphemism that refers to Abram’s death. However, it is best to translate the clause as literally as possible, since it implies the important information that people are still alive after they have died on earth. Also, notice that the term **fathers** refers here to ancestors who have died, not those who are still alive on earth. Alternate translation: [you will be at peace when you die and join your forefathers who have gone before you]

Consider whether or not to include that implied information in your translation or in a footnote. Also, see how you translated the names of people groups in Genesis [10:13–18](../10/13.md).

16:3	kkb6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	וַ⁠תִּקַּ֞ח שָׂרַ֣י אֵֽשֶׁת־אַבְרָ֗ם	1	In the Hebrew text, the phrase “Abram’s wife” is repeated (in [verses 1](../16/01.md) and [3](../16/03.md)) to emphasize Sarai’s relationship to Abram in contrast to the relationship of Hagar. For some languages it is redundant to repeat that phrase, and so they leave it implied here. However, if possible, it is best to keep this repetition in your translation. Alternate translation: [Then Sarai took]
16:3	hq9o			אֶת־הָגָ֤ר הַ⁠מִּצְרִית֙ שִׁפְחָתָ֔⁠הּ	1	The word **Egyptian** is repeated (in [verses 1](../16/01.md) and [3](../16/03.md)) to emphasize the fact that Hagar was a foreigner.

However, the repeated quote margins could be there to emphasize what the angel says next or to show that he paused or that he is changing the topic. Alternate translation: [Then the angel told her] or [Then he continued]
16:10	un14		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הַרְבָּ֥ה אַרְבֶּ֖ה אֶת־זַרְעֵ֑⁠ךְ	1	The pronoun **I** refers to Yahweh here. So either the angel was representing Yahweh and speaking Yahweh’s words to Hagar or it was Yahweh himself who had taken on the form of an angel. Alternate translation: [I, Yahweh, will greatly multiply the number of your offspring so that]
16:10	vljc			מֵ⁠רֹֽב	1	Alternate translation: [because of their large number]
16:11	c3yg			הִנָּ֥⁠ךְ הָרָ֖ה וְ⁠יֹלַ֣דְתְּ בֵּ֑ן	1	Make sure it is clear in your translation that Hagar already knew that she was pregnant but did not know she would have a son or what she should name him. Alternate translation: [Look, as you know, you are expecting a child. You will bear a son] or [Look, you are pregnant with a son]
16:11	mecd			וְ⁠קָרָ֤את שְׁמ⁠וֹ֙	1	Alternate translation: [give him the name]
16:11	tezq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	יִשְׁמָעֵ֔אל	1	Some translation teams make the meaning of Ishmael’s name explicit in their translation. Other teams put the meaning of his name in a footnote. See what you did for similar cases in \nGenesis [3:20](../03/20.md), [4:1, 16, 25](../04/01.md), [6:29](../06/29.md), [10:25](../10/25.md), and [11:9](../11/09.md).
16:11	q8bz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	כִּֽי־שָׁמַ֥ע יְהוָ֖ה אֶל	1	If you included the meaning of Ishmael’s name earlier in this verse, make sure it fits with how you translate this clause. Alternate translation: [because Yahweh heard] or [because Yahweh paid attention to]
16:11	aus7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עָנְיֵֽ⁠ךְ	1	The word that means **listened to** implies here that God also took action to help Hagar. Alternate translation: [your cries of misery and has helped you]
16:12	rnzx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠ה֤וּא	1	The pronoun **he** is emphatic here to emphasize Ishmael. Make sure that your translation refers here to Ishmael, not Yahweh. Alternate translation: [As for Ishmael, when he grows up, he]
16:12	p7hn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	יִהְיֶה֙ פֶּ֣רֶא אָדָ֔ם	1	The angel compares Ishmael to a wild donkey. Consider whether or not your language can use a similar image or a comparison here. Alternate translation: [will be like a untamed donkey that no one can control] or [will not be ruled by anyone else]
16:12	ihvp			יָד֣⁠וֹ בַ⁠כֹּ֔ל וְ⁠יַ֥ד כֹּ֖ל בּ֑⁠וֹ	1	Alternate translation: [He will be enemies with everyone]
16:12	y6tx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	וְ⁠עַל־פְּנֵ֥י & יִשְׁכֹּֽן	1	The rest of this verse forms a parallelism with the first half, emphasizing what Ishmael (and his descendants) will be like. Try to keep both parts of the parallelism in your translation, since each part has a different focus and the second part adds important information. Alternate translation: [Yes he will even fight against]
16:12	sdus		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	כָל־אֶחָ֖י⁠ו	1	The word **brothers** is used here to refer to relatives in general. Consider what is the best way to translate this synecdoche in your language. Alternate translation: [all of his own relatives] or [all of his own family members]

16:14	jkis			עַל־כֵּן֙	1	See how you translated this phrase in Genesis [11:9](../11/09.md).
16:14	x357		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	קָרָ֣א לַ⁠בְּאֵ֔ר	1	Frequently in the Hebrew text, this phrase has a general meaning and does not refer to someone specific. Also, this well is the same as the spring in [verse 7](../16/07.md). For some languages, it may be necessary to translate these words the same way so that it is clear that they refer to the same place. Alternate translation: [the well is named] or [people call that well] or [the name of the well is]
16:14	vkz7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הִנֵּ֥ה	1	The author is using the term **Behold** to focus his reader’s attention on what he is about to say. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: [Look, that well is still there; ]
16:14	v5d5			בֵין־קָדֵ֖שׁ וּ⁠בֵ֥ין בָּֽרֶד	1	Be consistent here with how you spelled **Kadesh** in Genesis [14:7](../14/07.md)

Consider what is the best way in your language to begin this new section. See how you translated “was a son of … years” in Gen [5:32](../05/32.md). Alternate translation: [It was thirteen years later that Abram was 99 years old ]
17:1	b3u2			וַ⁠יֵּרָ֨א יְהוָ֜ה אֶל־אַבְרָ֗ם	1	See how you translated this clause in Gen [12:7](../12/07.md). Alternate translation: [Yahweh appeared to him] or [Yahweh visited him]
17:1	ph7e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	אֲנִי־אֵ֣ל שַׁדַּ֔י	1	Most translation teams translate the meaning of God’s title here (**God Almighty**). A few teams transliterate the title as “El Shaddai” (as if it were a personal name) and put the meaning of the title in a footnote. Abram already knew that God’s personal name is Yahweh (Genesis [12:8](../12/08.md); [15:7–8](../15/07.md)), so he would have understood that God was using a title here (not a personal name). The title **God Almighty** emphasizes God’s authority and power. You could include a transliteration of this title in a footnote. Alternate translation: [I am Almighty God] or [I am the all-powerful God]
17:1	z65o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	הִתְהַלֵּ֥ךְ לְ⁠פָנַ֖⁠י	1	**Walk before me** is an idiom that means to habitually live according to God’s will. Alternate translation: [Walk in my presence] or [Live according to my will]

17:3	iqyn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וַ⁠יִּפֹּ֥ל אַבְרָ֖ם עַל־פָּנָ֑י⁠ו	1	Make sure that the translation of this clause, **Abram fell on his face**, does not sound like Abram fell down accidentally. Rather, he intentionally threw himself to the ground out of deep respect for God. Alternate translation: [Then Abram prostrated himself before God]
17:3	ia2w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יְדַבֵּ֥ר אִתּ֛⁠וֹ אֱלֹהִ֖ים לֵ⁠אמֹֽר	1	Some translations omit **saying** here because it is not natural in those languages. Alternate translation: [and God spoke to him and said] or [and God added]
17:4	opjt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֲנִ֕י הִנֵּ֥ה בְרִיתִ֖⁠י אִתָּ֑⁠ךְ וְ⁠הָיִ֕יתָ	1	In the Hebrew text, the pronoun **Me** is emphatic both in form and in sentence position. **Me, behold** is similar to “Behold, me**, which means “I am about to.” Use a natural way in your language to emphasize that Yahweh is the one doing this. Alternate translation: [As for me, I am about to fulfill my covenant with you, that you will be] or [On my part, I am about to fulfill my covenant with you: I will make you]

17:5	y88x			וְ⁠הָיָ֤ה שִׁמְ⁠ךָ֙ אַבְרָהָ֔ם	1	Alternate translation: [Instead, from now on it will be Abraham] or [Rather, I am changing it now to Abraham]
17:5	ju00		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	כִּ֛י & נְתַתִּֽי⁠ךָ	1	Yahweh is using the past tense to describe something that is going to happen in the future in order to show that the event will certainly happen. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use the future tense. Consider what is the best way to communicate that in your language. Alternate translation: [because I will make you]
17:6	d68r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וְ⁠הִפְרֵתִ֤י אֹֽתְ⁠ךָ֙ בִּ⁠מְאֹ֣ד מְאֹ֔ד	1	This verse elaborates on the last part of [verse 5](../17/05.md); it does not refer to different events.

17:6	p8wc			וּ⁠נְתַתִּ֖י⁠ךָ לְ⁠גוֹיִ֑ם	1	Alternate translation: [so that you will be the father of many ethnic groups] or [and I will cause your descendants to become many ethnic groups]
17:6	vqo1			וּ⁠מְלָכִ֖ים מִמְּ⁠ךָ֥ יֵצֵֽאוּ	1	See how you translated “king” in Genesis [14:1–5](../14/01.md). Alternate translation: [In fact, there will be kings who descend from you]

17:9	qzbp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר אֱלֹהִים֙ אֶל־אַבְרָהָ֔ם	1	Some languages leave out this quote margin, because God is still speaking to the same person. See what you did for similar cases in Genesis [16:10–11](../16/10.md).
17:9	ognl			וְ⁠אַתָּ֖ה	1	In the Hebrew text, the pronoun **you** is emphatic both in form and in sentence position to shift the focus from talking about God’s part in the covenant ([verses 4-8](../17/04.md)) to talking about Abraham’s part. Translate this phrase in a way that shows this change in focus. Alternate translation: [As for you] or [Now as for your part in my covenant] or [Your responsibility in my agreement is that]
17:9	zstx			אֶת־בְּרִיתִ֣⁠י תִשְׁמֹ֑ר	1	Alternate translation: [you must fulfill all the requirements of my agreement]
17:9	uumy			לְ⁠דֹרֹתָֽ⁠ם	1	See how you translated this phrase in [verse 7](../17/07.md), and a similar phrase in [verse 8](../17/08.md). Alternate translation: [including all generations to come] or [for all future generations]
17:10	mdxu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	אֲשֶׁ֣ר תִּשְׁמְר֗וּ	1	The pronoun **you** is plural here because Yahweh is addressing Abraham and all his future offspring, even though they do not yet exist, so use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction. Alternate translation: [which you and all of your future descendants]
17:10	esro		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	בֵּינִ⁠י֙ וּ⁠בֵ֣ינֵי⁠כֶ֔ם וּ⁠בֵ֥ין	1	The pronoun **you** is plural here and probably refers to Abraham and his family or household.

17:10	bxe0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	זַרְעֲ⁠ךָ֖ אַחֲרֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1	Notice that the pronouns **your** and **you** are singular here because they refer to Abraham.

17:10	vmk2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	זֹ֣את בְּרִיתִ֞⁠י אֲשֶׁ֣ר תִּשְׁמְר֗וּ בֵּינִ⁠י֙ וּ⁠בֵ֣ינֵי⁠כֶ֔ם וּ⁠בֵ֥ין זַרְעֲ⁠ךָ֖ אַחֲרֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1	It may be clearer or more natural to change the order of some of the clauses in this sentence. Alternate translation: [This is what I require in my covenant with you and your descendants who will live after you, which you all must keep]

Translate this clause in a way that does not offend or embarrass people. Some languages may need to be more discreet and say something general like “must cut off the male skin” or “must follow the male skin-cutting custom.” It may be necessary to include a footnote and an explanation in the glossary about this so that people understand what circumcision is, especially in areas where people cut their skin on other parts of the body for other reasons. Alternate translation: [You must cut off the male foreskin of every boy and man who lives among you]
17:11	mhww		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	וּ⁠נְמַלְתֶּ֕ם אֵ֖ת בְּשַׂ֣ר עָרְלַתְ⁠כֶ֑ם	1	Notice that in the Hebrew text, the pronouns **you** and **your** are plural in this verse. Also, be consistent here with how you translated “circumcise” in [verse 10](../17/10.md).

17:12	pl8e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וּ⁠בֶן־שְׁמֹנַ֣ת יָמִ֗ים יִמּ֥וֹל	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [You must circumcise every eight-day-old baby boy] or [So you must circumcise every eight-day-old baby boy]
17:12	c7zl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כָּל־זָכָ֖ר	1	The words **every male** could mean: (1) “and every other male.” Alternate translation: [as well as all other males]; (2) “yes, every male child.” The following context suggests that this phrase includes males of all ages, not just babies, since male slaves who were bought would especially include adult males.
17:12	n2rq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	וּ⁠בֶן־שְׁמֹנַ֣ת יָמִ֗ים יִמּ֥וֹל לָ⁠כֶ֛ם כָּל־זָכָ֖ר לְ⁠דֹרֹתֵי⁠כֶ֑ם	1	It may be more natural to put this phrase at the beginning of this verse.

17:13	bi24		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	הִמּ֧וֹל ׀ יִמּ֛וֹל	1	The author is repeating forms of the verb **circumcising** in order to intensify his expression of the idea that it conveys. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the intensification. Alternate translation: [Yes, you must surely circumcise all of them]
17:13	zibc			יְלִ֥יד בֵּֽיתְ⁠ךָ֖ וּ⁠מִקְנַ֣ת כַּסְפֶּ֑⁠ךָ	1	See how you translated these phrases in [verse 12](../17/12.md).

Consider whether or not your language has a similar idiom that would work well here. Alternate translation: [that person must be sent away and not be allowed to fellowship with his people] or [you must send him away and not allow him to fellowship with his people]
17:14	x4d6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	הֵפַֽר	1	This phrase has the opposite meaning of “keep” or “obey” in [verse 9](../17/09.md). Consider whether or not your language has an idiom like **broken** that means to not do what has been agreed upon or to disobey what was commanded. Alternate translation: [because he has not kept]
17:15	b4k2			וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר אֱלֹהִים֙ אֶל־אַבְרָהָ֔ם	1	Alternate translation: [Later God also said to Abraham]

17:17	d074		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הַ⁠לְּ⁠בֶ֤ן מֵאָֽה־שָׁנָה֙ יִוָּלֵ֔ד	1	Abraham uses the rhetorical questions in [verse 17](../17/17.md) to express strong disbelief. If that is not clear in your language, you could translate the rhetorical questions as statements, with or without a tag question. Alternate translation: [A hundred-year-old man like myself cannot father a son!] or [It is impossible for a hundred-year-old man like me to father a son!] or [A hundred-year-old man like me cannot father a child, can he?]

A tent did not have a solid wood door such as a house has. You could say that explicitly if that would be helpful to your readers Alternate translation: [at the cloth-covered doorway of his tent] or [at the way by which to enter the tent]

18:3	i1yu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	אֲדֹנָ֗⁠י	1	Abraham uses **lords** here as a polite address to the three men.

Make sure your translation does not sound here like Abraham was only offering the men a tiny bit of water; he or his servants were going to bring them enough water to wash their feet. Alternate translation: [Let my servants bring you some water]
18:4	ygvl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	וְ⁠רַחֲצ֖וּ רַגְלֵי⁠כֶ֑ם	1	People wore sandals, and their feet would get dusty when they traveled.

18:5	w6hc			פַת	1	Saying **a morsel** was a polite way of showing generosity. Make sure your translation does not sound here like Abraham was only offering the men a tiny bit of bread; he was going to give them plenty of food to eat. Alternate translation: [a little bit of]

18:6	vfdt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bvolume	שְׁלֹ֤שׁ סְאִים֙	1	It is believed that **three seahs** was equivalent to over 20 liters. It was enough flour to make bread for many people, just as the calf ([verse 7](../18/07.md)) provided enough meat for many people and showed generous hospitality. Besides Abraham’s guests, others in his household may have also joined in eating the feast. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could express this in terms of modern measurements, either in the text or in a footnote. Alternate translation: [three large scoops]
18:6	yzn0			קֶ֣מַח סֹ֔לֶת	1	Alternate translation: [of good quality flour] or [of the best flour]
18:6	ygf6			ל֖וּשִׁי וַ⁠עֲשִׂ֥י עֻגֽוֹת	1	The Hebrew word for **loaves** here is often translated “cakes,” which probably refers to their flat, round shape (similar to biscuits). However, make sure your translation of this word does not sound like a dessert, because this bread was not sweet.

18:7	jtgs			וַ⁠יִּתֵּ֣ן	1	The word **gave** means Abram brought the calf to his servant and put him in charge of preparing its meat for a meal. Make sure your translation does not sound like the calf was a gift. Alternate translation: [Then he took the calf] or [Then he turned it over]

Alternate translation: [and he served all of it to the three men to eat] or [and he set it all before his three guests to eat]
18:8	oc6u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֹּאכֵֽלוּ	1	As the host, Abraham stood nearby his guests in order to wait on them and make sure they had everything that they needed. Alternate translation: [and waited on them while they ate]
18:9	xl7m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּאמְר֣וּ אֵׄלָׄ֔יׄ⁠וׄ	1	The Hebrew text uses a plural pronoun here (**they**) to refer to one of the three men who spoke to Abraham on behalf of them all (See [verse 10](../18/10.md)). Many languages can use **they** or “the men” in the same way. Make sure your translation of this quote margin does not sound like all three of the men spoke at the same time. Alternate translation: [Then one of the men asked him]
18:9	frnv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֖אמֶר	1	Make sure it is clear in your translation that Abraham is the one speaking here. Alternate translation: [He answered him]

18:10	b369			וַ⁠יֹּ֗אמֶר	1	This phrase refers to the man in [verse 9](../18/09.md) who spoke on behalf of himself and the other two men. We find out in [verse 13](../18/13.md) that the man was actually Yahweh. However, at this point Abraham and Sarah probably did not yet know who he was, so it is better to not specify who he was here, in order to keep that suspense in your translation. Alternate translation: [Then that man]
18:10	qpv8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֗אמֶר	1	Alternate translation: [said to him] or [spoke again to Abraham]

18:10	s103		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	כָּ⁠עֵ֣ת חַיָּ֔ה	1	For some languages it may be more natural to move this time phrase to the beginning of this quote and say, “Next year at this time I will surely return …” Alternate translation: [at this season next year] or [next year at this time]
18:10	usku			וְ⁠הִנֵּה	1	Alternate translation: [and when I do] or [At that time]
18:10	yh3k			בֵ֖ן לְ⁠שָׂרָ֣ה אִשְׁתֶּ֑⁠ךָ	1	This means that Sarah would have a son with her when Yahweh returns. It does not mean that she would give birth at that time. Alternate translation: [your wife Sarah will have a baby boy with her] or [your wife Sarah will already have a baby son]
18:10	kp1s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	וְ⁠שָׂרָ֥ה שֹׁמַ֛עַת	1	This sentence gives information about something that was happening while the man was talking.

18:10	vtqh			וְ⁠ה֥וּא אַחֲרָֽי⁠ו	1	Notice that the pronoun **it** refers to the entrance to the tent (where Sarah was). Alternate translation: [which was right behind]
18:10	g6tq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אַחֲרָֽי⁠ו	1	The pronoun **him** is ambiguous here. It could refer to: (1) “the man” or (2) “Abraham” Alternate translation: [was behind Abraham]
18:11	oz4x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	וְ⁠אַבְרָהָ֤ם וְ⁠שָׂרָה֙	1	This verse gives background information that is important to what happens next. Some languages use a conjunction such as **Now** here to introduce this kind of information, while other languages omit the conjunction, especially if **Now** is used to begin the last sentence in [verse 10](../18/10.md).

Alternate translation: [And Yahweh replied] or [He answered him]
18:32	igm4			בַּ⁠עֲב֖וּר	1	Consider again how you translated this phrase in [verses 24](../18/24.md), [26](../18/26.md), [29](../18/29.md), [31](../18/31.md), [32](../18/32.md). Alternate translation: [because of]

19:2	qrka		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	הִנֶּ֣ה נָּא־אֲדֹנַ֗⁠י	1	See how you translated **Behold, please** in Genesis [18:27](../18/27.md). Also see how you translated “my lord” in Genesis [18:3](../18/03.md). At this point, Lot probably did not know that these were angels, because they looked like men. Alternate translation: [Listen to me please, my lords] or [Sirs please listen to this:]
19:2	uv8k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	ס֣וּרוּ נָ֠א אֶל	1	Lot is being urgent here (using **please** twice), probably because he knows how dangerous the city is. Translate this quote in a way that communicates this urgency. Alternate translation: [Please stop in at]

19:2	bnmm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	לֹּ֔א כִּ֥י	1	Abraham is responding to the angels with the courteous expression that a person in this culture would use to respond to a superior. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. The angels’ reply should sound polite and respectful in your translation, not rude or disrespectful. For example, in some cultures it is not polite to say **No** too directly. Alternate translation: [No, thank you, rather] or [That is kind of you, but]
19:2	nmtj			בָ⁠רְח֖וֹב נָלִֽין	1	This refers to a public, outdoor place inside the city, perhaps the open place inside the city gate where people would meet. Alternate translation: [we will just stay in the city square tonight] or [we plan to stay the night in the square]

It is common in the Bible to say that a leader or head of household (as here) did something, when in reality he had it done by someone else who was under his authority. Alternate translation: [Then he made a big meal for them] or [Then Lot had a big meal prepared for them]

19:4	pth7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	כָּל־הָ⁠עָ֖ם מִ⁠קָּצֶֽה	1	This phrase is generalization or exaggeration used to emphasize that a very large number of people from the city were there. Consider whether or not your language can do the same thing. Alternate translation: [In fact, all the people from every section of the city were there] or [so that people from the entire city were there] or [In fact, everyone from all parts of the city had come there]
19:5	yafr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יִּקְרְא֤וּ	1	Here the author is using the pronoun **they** in a general sense, not to refer to specific people. Use an expression for this that would be natural in your language. Alternate translation: [Then the mob of people called out] or [Then the men shouted]
19:5	mtxz			אֲשֶׁר־בָּ֥אוּ אֵלֶ֖י⁠ךָ הַ⁠לָּ֑יְלָה	1	Alternate translation: [who came to your house tonight?]

19:7	fcre		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	נָ֥א אַחַ֖⁠י	1	The phrase **my brothers** is used here as a polite address that implies a close relationship. Lot uses this common expression to try to get the men of Sodom to not harm his guests. The men were not his actual brothers. For some languages it is more natural to put **my brothers** (or “my friends”) first in this quote. Alternate translation: [No, please, my friends] or [I beg you, my brothers] or [No, my brothers please]

19:9	o113		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	נָרַ֥ע לְ⁠ךָ֖ מֵ⁠הֶ֑ם	1	Here the crowd switches from talking to each other to shouting at Lot. Decide whether or not that needs to be explicit in your translation.

Also, for some languages it may be better to change the order of phrases in this verse and say, “Then Yahweh caused fire and burning sulfur to fall like heavy rain from the heavens on the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah.” Alternate translation: [from himself in heaven] or [from out of the sky]

19:25	euza			וְ⁠אֵ֖ת כָּל־הַ⁠כִּכָּ֑ר	1	Make sure it is clear in your translation that the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah were also in the plain, not separate from it. Alternate translation: [and the whole valley] or [and the rest of the plain]

Do what is best in your language throughout this chapter. Alternate translation: [But God appeared to King Abimelech in a dream]
20:3	ompr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	הַ⁠לָּ֑יְלָה	1	It may be more natural to put this time phrase earlier in this sentence and say, “But that night God appeared to King Abimelech in a dream …” Alternate translation: [during the night] or [by night]

20:3	tkin		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	הִנְּ⁠ךָ֥ מֵת֙	1	God is using the present tense to describe something that is going to happen in the future in order to warn that the event could happen soon. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use the future tense. Make sure that the way you translate this clause does not make it sound like King Abimelech is already dead. Alternate translation: [Hear me warn you, you are a dead man]

Alternate translation: [had not yet slept with her] or [had not had marital relations with Sarah]
20:4	giez		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּאמַ֕ר	1	The way you translate this quote margin will depend on how you translate the rhetorical question that follows it.

20:4	on63		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠ג֥וֹי גַּם־צַדִּ֖יק תַּהֲרֹֽג׃	1	King Abimelech uses a rhetorical question here to express his desperate concern. Abimelech is saying in a dramatic way that if God kills him, he will destroy the innocent nation that Abimelech leads as their king. Make sure in your translation that he sounds humble and not angry or rude. Alternate translation: [please do not kill me and the people I rule, since we are righteous.]
20:4	d8vu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	צַדִּ֖יק	1	Consider again how you translated the word **righteous** in the book of Genesis. See [6:9](../06/09.md), [7:1](../07/01.md), [18:23–26](../18/23.md), [28](../18/28.md); [20:4](../20/04.md). It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context. Alternate translation: [we are actually righteous]

20:5	bdcs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וּ⁠בְ⁠נִקְיֹ֥ן כַּפַּ֖⁠י	1	Abimilech’s statement, **in the innocence of my hands**, means that he was not aware of any wrongdoing in his actions. If you use an exclamation point here in your translation, make sure it does not mean that King Abimelech is angry or being rude; rather, he is desperate. Alternate translation: [and with clean hands!]

20:6	ucn6			וָ⁠אֶחְשֹׂ֧ךְ גַּם־אָנֹכִ֛י אֽוֹתְ⁠ךָ֖ מֵ⁠חֲטוֹ־לִ֑⁠י	1	In the Hebrew text, **I** is an emphatic pronoun. Try to communicate that emphasis in a natural way in your translation.

In this case, Abraham serves as an intercessor and speaks for God and prays what God wants him to say ([verses 7](../20/07.md),[17](../20/17.md)). Avoid a translation of this term that focuses on telling the future, which is only one of the things that a prophet might do. Alternate translation: [He is a prophet for me]

It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: [Then Abimelech called for Abraham and said to him, “What have you done to us? And how have I sinned against you, Abraham, so that you brought a great sin on me, King Abimelech, and on my kingdom? Abraham, you have done deeds to me that should not be done]

20:10	y1ly		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֥אמֶר אֲבִימֶ֖לֶךְ אֶל־אַבְרָהָ֑ם	1	For some languages it is more natural here to omit this quote margin, because the same person is still talking to the same person. However, the words emphasize what King Abimelech says next and may indicate that there was a pause between what he said in [verse 9](../20/09.md) and in [verse 10](../20/10.md). Alternate translation: [Then Abilelech continued by asking Abraham]

It is a complex term that means to recognize how holy and powerful God is and to deeply respect and honor him by obeying and worshiping him. Consider whether it is better in your language to translate this embedded quote as a direct or indirect quote.

Rather, people paid each other with shekels of silver or gold shekels, which was a weight measurement. A thousand shekels of silver was about 25 pounds (11.5 kilos) of silver. Many translation teams like to keep the same numbers that are in the Hebrew text in their translation, and then in a footnote give the equivalent amount in their own currency. Other teams put the equivalent amount in the text and put the literal phrase in a footnote. Alternate translation: [I have given 1,000 pieces of silver to your brother] or [I have given your brother 1,000 pieces of silver]

20:18	lzt7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge	שָׂרָ֖ה אֵ֥שֶׁת אַבְרָהָֽם	1	For some languages, it may be more natural to change the order of the clauses in this sentence (which begins in [verse 17](../20/17.md)) and say, “Before this, Yahweh had completely closed up every womb in the household of King Abimelech because he had taken Abraham’s wife Sarah. Then Abraham prayed …” If the order is changed, it will be necessary to combine these two verses and to put the verse numbers “17-18” in front of the sentence. Some translation teams have decided that they will never combine verses like that. Other teams have decided that occasionally it is acceptable to do that if it makes the meaning clearer.
21:1	ia7b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַֽ⁠יהוָ֛ה פָּקַ֥ד אֶת־שָׂרָ֖ה כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֣ר אָמָ֑ר	1	The word **visited** is used here as an idiom that means God blessed Sarah and was kind to her (by enabling her to have a son).

Alternate translation: [that he should punish you severely if you will deal falsely with me]

For some languages it is clearer or more natural to put this time phrase earlier in this sentence and say, “… lived there for many years in the land …”
22:1	oi54		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֗י אַחַר֙ הַ⁠דְּבָרִ֣ים הָ⁠אֵ֔לֶּה	1	This is the beginning of a new episode that takes place around twelve years after Abraham and King Abimelech made their treaty ([chapter 21](../21/01.md)). See how you translated “after those events” in Genesis [15:1](../15/01.md); it may be necessary to translate this phrase in a slightly different way here because of the different context. Alternate translation: [Sometime after those things happened] or [Several years later]

The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words.

It may be clearer in your language to connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: [Please take your son, yes, your only son whom you love]
22:2	zek7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠לֶךְ־לְ⁠ךָ֔	1	It is understood that he was to take Isaac with him. If this is not clear in your language, you could make that information explicit. Alternate translation: [and go with him]

Rather, the **good things** that he loaded on the camels included things that he would give as gifts to Isaac’s relatives ([verse 53](../24/53.md)).

24:11	ct2m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לְ⁠עֵ֖ת צֵ֥את הַ⁠שֹּׁאֲבֹֽת	1	In that time and culture, there was no running water in homes so people had to go out to the city well to get water for their families.

Some languages have a single word for this; other languages prefer a phrase.

24:20	llu6			וַ⁠תְּמַהֵ֗ר וַ⁠תְּעַ֤ר כַּדָּ⁠הּ֙	1	See how you translated **Then she hurried and** in [verse 18](../24/18.md). Alternate translation: [So she quickly poured the rest of the water from her jug]
24:20	xlk7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	אֶל־הַ⁠שֹּׁ֔קֶת	1	The drinking **trough** was a long, open, stone container that several animals could drink from at the same time. Alternate translation: [into the animal drinking place that was there] or [into the stone container that was there for animals to drink out of]
24:20	brw2			וַ⁠תָּ֥רָץ ע֛וֹד אֶֽל־הַ⁠בְּאֵ֖ר לִ⁠שְׁאֹ֑ב	1	Alternate translation: [and ran back and forth to the well to get more water]
24:20	zyv5			וַ⁠תִּשְׁאַ֖ב לְ⁠כָל־גְּמַלָּֽי⁠ו	1	Alternate translation: [until she had brought enough for all of the camels]
24:21	qhyv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	וְ⁠הָ⁠אִ֥ישׁ מִשְׁתָּאֵ֖ה לָ֑⁠הּ מַחֲרִ֕ישׁ	1	Starting in [verse 21](../24/21.md) the Hebrew text takes Rebekah and Laban’s perspective and refers to Abraham’s servant as **the man**. This continues until [verse 34](../24/34.md), when the servant tells everyone that he is Abraham’s servant. For some languages this is confusing (because it sounds like two different people), so for those languages it is necessary to refer to him as “Abraham’s servant” or “the servant” throughout this chapter.
24:21	mzx4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	לָ⁠דַ֗עַת הַֽ⁠הִצְלִ֧יחַ יְהוָ֛ה דַּרְכּ֖⁠וֹ אִם־לֹֽא	1	Alternate translation: [to find out whether or not Yahweh had made him successful on his trip to find a wife for Isaac] or [to see for sure if Yahweh had given him success on his trip]
24:22	z0mg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יְהִ֗י כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֨ר כִּלּ֤וּ הַ⁠גְּמַלִּים֙ לִ⁠שְׁתּ֔וֹת	1	Alternate translation: [After all the camels had drunk as much water as they wanted and Rebekah had stopped drawing water]
24:22	sg19		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bweight	וַ⁠יִּקַּ֤ח הָ⁠אִישׁ֙ נֶ֣זֶם זָהָ֔ב בֶּ֖קַע מִשְׁקָל֑⁠וֹ	1	This one **beka** was about 1/5 of an ounce (6 grams) of gold. The **ten shekels** was about 4 ounces (110 grams) of gold. In your translation, you could use the ancient measurement and spell the words beka and shekels the way they sound in your language. You could also use the metric measurements given in the UST or use the measurement that your language and culture customarily use. Alternatively, you could use the ancient measurement and put a modern measurement in parentheses in the text or in a footnote. Alternate translation: [the servant brought out a gold nose ring weighing one beka and gave it to her] or [the servant gave her a gold nose ring that weighed one beka]
24:22	szjk			וּ⁠שְׁנֵ֤י צְמִידִים֙ & זָהָ֖ב	1	Alternate translation: [He also gave her two gold bracelets]
24:22	pn2g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bweight	עֲשָׂרָ֥ה & מִשְׁקָלָֽ⁠ם	1	Alternate translation: [Each bracelet weighed ten shekels]
24:23	ivak		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר֙	1	Alternate translation: [Then he said to her] or [Then he asked Rebekah]
24:23	m6vp			בַּת־מִ֣י אַ֔תְּ הַגִּ֥ידִי נָ֖א לִ֑⁠י	1	The phrase **Please tell me** can go: (1) with the previous question (“Whose daughter are you?”); or (2) with the following question (“Is there a place … to lodge?”). Since Abraham’s servant’s goal was to find a wife for Isaac who was one of Abraham’s relatives, the first interpretation seems most likely.
24:23	t1yc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	הֲ⁠יֵ֧שׁ בֵּית־אָבִ֛י⁠ךְ מָק֥וֹם	1	If you made **your father** explicit in the previous sentence, it may be more natural to refer to him with the pronoun “his” in this sentence. Alternate translation: [Also, is there enough room in his house] or [Also, does your father have any room in his house]
24:23	pzbr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	לָ֖⁠נוּ	1	The pronoun **us** includes other servants who came with Abraham’s chief servant (as [verse 32](../24/32.md) shows). If your language has inclusive and exclusive forms of this pronoun, you should use the exclusive form here.
24:23	zoch			לָ⁠לִֽין	1	Alternate translation: [to stay there tonight?]
24:24	edbe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠תֹּ֣אמֶר אֵלָ֔י⁠ו	1	Alternate translation: [She answered him] or [She replied]
24:24	v7bk			בַּת־בְּתוּאֵ֖ל אָנֹ֑כִי	1	Alternate translation: [Bethuel is my father]
24:24	l5rk			בֶּן־מִלְכָּ֕ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר יָלְדָ֖ה לְ⁠נָחֽוֹר	1	Make sure the way you translate this does not sound like Bethuel was the only son of Milcah and Nahor; they had eight sons (Genesis [22:21–22](../22/21.md)). Also, in some cultures the father’s name is normally given first; in other cultures the mother’s name is normally first. Alternate translation: [who is a son of Milcah and Nahor] or [and his parents are Nahor and Milcah]
24:25	pbeh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠תֹּ֣אמֶר אֵלָ֔י⁠ו	1	Some languages leave this quote margin implied here, because the same person is still talking to the same person. Other languages can keep the quote margin (like the Hebrew text does), to emphasize what Rebekah says next. The quote margin may also indicate that Rebekah paused before she said what she says in [verse 25](../24/25.md). Alternate translation: [Then she continued]
24:25	wijh			גַּם־תֶּ֥בֶן גַּם־מִסְפּ֖וֹא רַ֣ב עִמָּ֑⁠נוּ	1	The term **fodder** refers to dry feed that is prepared for animals to eat; it can include chopped hay and grains such as oats and barley. Alternate translation: [We have plenty of both straw and other feed at our house for your camels to eat]
24:25	dj14			גַּם־מָק֖וֹם	1	Alternate translation: [and there is also enough room in his house for all of you]
24:25	c715			לָ⁠לֽוּן	1	See how you translated this in [verse 23](../24/23.md). Alternate translation: [to spend the night there]

The word **prostrated** means he bowed low to the ground and touched his face or forehead to the ground with outstretched arms, in an act of worship. When combined with **bowed down** as in this verse, it is usually translated as “worshiped.”
24:27	kzzy			וַ⁠יֹּ֗אמֶר	1	The servant is worshiping God by bowing down and by what he says in [verse 27](../24/27.md). Alternate translation: [He said]
24:27	lmcg			בָּר֤וּךְ יְהוָה֙	1	See how you translated this in Genesis [9:26](../09/26.md). Alternate translation: [I praise Yahweh]

If it would be helpful in your language, you could emphasize the positive meaning in a strong way. Alternate translation: [who has always been kind and faithful to my master]
24:27	inzl			אָנֹכִ֗י בַּ⁠דֶּ֨רֶךְ֙ נָחַ֣⁠נִי יְהוָ֔ה	1	The last part of [verse 27](../24/27.md) is what Abraham’s servant is praising God for; it is an example of how God has been kind and faithful to Abraham. Alternate translation: [and he has guided me on the road here] or [Yes, he guided me on my trip here]
24:28	easg			וַ⁠תָּ֨רָץ֙ הַֽ⁠נַּעֲרָ֔	1	See how you translated **young woman** previously in this chapter, and consider what is the best way to refer to Rebekah here. Alternate translation: [Then Rebekah ran home]
24:28	tpgz			וַ⁠תַּגֵּ֖ד	1	Alternate translation: [and reported to] or [and shared the news with]

24:29	w36y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	וּ⁠לְ⁠רִבְקָ֥ה אָ֖ח	1	Laban was Rebekah’s older brother. Some languages have a specific term for “older brother” that fits well here. Also, consider what is the best way to introduce this background information in your language. Alternate translation: [Now it so happened that Rebekah had a brother]
24:29	fm49			וּ⁠שְׁמ֣⁠וֹ לָבָ֑ן	1	Alternate translation: [named Laban]
24:29	natm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יָּ֨רָץ לָבָ֧ן	1	Consider what is the best way to refer to Laban here in your language. Alternate translation: [and he ran] or [He ran]
24:29	awi9			אֶל־הָ⁠אִ֛ישׁ הַ⁠ח֖וּצָ⁠ה אֶל־הָ⁠עָֽיִן	1	Alternate translation: [out to the spring where the man was] or [to where the man was standing beside the well]
24:30	isaz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-versebridge	וַ⁠יְהִ֣י ׀ כִּ⁠רְאֹ֣ת	1	[Verse 30](../24/30.md) is a flashback of what had happened before Laban ran to the well ([verse 29](../24/29.md)). Consider what is the best way to express this in your language. For some languages it may be necessary to combine [verses 29-30](../24/29.md) and put the sentences in the order that things actually happened. For example, “Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban. When he saw the nose ring and the bracelets she was wearing and heard her tell what the man had said to her, he hurried out to meet the man. He found/saw him standing with his camels beside the well.” If you do this, you would mark these combined verses as 29-30. Alternate translation: [This is how it was When he had seen] or [As soon as he had seen]
24:30	ez7q			אֶת־הַ⁠נֶּ֗זֶם וְֽ⁠אֶת־הַ⁠צְּמִדִים֮ עַל־יְדֵ֣י אֲחֹת⁠וֹ֒	1	Some languages have a specific term for “younger sister” that fits well here. Also see how you translated **nose ring** and **bracelets** in [verse 22](../24/22.md). Alternate translation: [the nose ring and the bracelets that his sister was wearing]

If you want to make it clear who **the man** refers to, you should still translate it generally, for example, “the man I met at the well” because when Rebekah said this, she did not yet know who he was. Alternate translation: [and had heard her tell what the man at the well had said to her]
24:30	d8fj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יָּבֹא֙ אֶל־הָ⁠אִ֔ישׁ	1	Alternate translation: [he went out to where the man was]

24:31	q7mg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	לָ֤⁠מָּה תַעֲמֹד֙ בַּ⁠ח֔וּץ	1	Laban is being polite here, not accusing or critical. For some languages a rhetorical question does not fit here.

24:32	ib7t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יְפַתַּ֖ח הַ⁠גְּמַלִּ֑ים	1	The pronoun **he** probably refers to Laban. Since Laban was the host, it is most likely that he (or some of his servants) took care of the camels for his guests. Alternate translation: [There Laban took the loads off the camels]
24:32	bzwz			וַ⁠יִּתֵּ֨ן תֶּ֤בֶן וּ⁠מִסְפּוֹא֙ לַ⁠גְּמַלִּ֔ים	1	See how you translated **straw and fodder** in [verse 25](../24/25.md). Alternate translation: [and fed them straw and other fodder]

See how you translated “wash the dust off your feet” in Genesis [19:2](../19/02.md).
24:33	k5bb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ו⁠יישם לְ⁠פָנָי⁠ו֙ לֶ⁠אֱכֹ֔ל	1	Consider whether it is best in your language to use a passive or active construction here. Alternate translation: [Then they brought the servant and his men some food]

25:5	cgzs			וַ⁠יִּתֵּ֧ן אַבְרָהָ֛ם אֶת־כָּל־אֲשֶׁר־ל֖⁠וֹ לְ⁠יִצְחָֽק	1	Some languages have a specific word such as “left” or “willed” that means to give something as an inheritance. In that time and culture, a father would give his children their inheritance before he died. Alternate translation: [Abraham willed everything that he owned to Isaac] or [And Isaac inherited all that Abraham owned]

Consider whether it is best in your language to transliterate (copy) the Hebrew name or to translate the meaning. Alternate translation: [then while he was still alive he sent them eastward to the region in the East] or [but after that he sent them to the east country] or [and after that he made them move away to the east country]

It is best to translate this phrase fairly literally since it teaches about life after death. Alternate translation: [he was taken by God to be with] or [God took his spirit to be with]
25:8	z547		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עַמָּֽי⁠ו	1	Make sure your translation of this phrase does not sound like these ancestors were still alive. They had already died before Abraham died. Alternate translation: [his relatives who had already died] or [his ancestors who had gone before him] or [his deceased relatives]

25:10	ekpo			מֵ⁠אֵ֣ת בְּנֵי־חֵ֑ת	1	The Hebrew text has two different ways to refer to the Hittites; compare the phrase here with [verse 9](../25/09.md) where a single Hebrew word is used to refer to this people group. See how you translated **the sons of Heth** in Genesis [23:20](../23/20.md).

Both refer to temporary or permanent places where people settled, surrounded by some sort of wall or fence. Also, many translations have “princes” here instead of “rulers,” but these Ishmaelite rulers were not actually sons of a king. See how you translated **rulers** in Genesis [17:20](../17/20.md). Alternate translation: [who became the rulers of twelve tribes that were named after them, and each tribe lived in its own settlements and camps] or [Each of them became the ruler of a tribe that was named after him, and each tribe had its own villages and tent settlements]

The name **Shur** means “wall.” The Wilderness of Shur may have been named after a city or fortification named Shur that was located near the eastern border of Egypt (Genesis [16:7](../16/07.md)). Alternate translation: [throughout the area that extended from the region of Havilah to the desert of Shur]
25:18	c8ld			אֲשֶׁר֙ עַל־פְּנֵ֣י מִצְרַ֔יִם	1	Alternate translation: [that is east of the land of Egypt]

Alternate translation: [to the city of Asshur in Assyria] or [in the direction of the land of Assyria]
25:18	wu16		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	עַל־פְּנֵ֥י כָל־אֶחָ֖י⁠ו נָפָֽל	1	The meaning of this idiom is uncertain. It could mean: (1) “He lived in hostility toward all his brothers.” Alternate translation: [They lived as enemies against all their relatives] See how you translated a different idiom in [16:12](../16/12.md) that probably has this meaning. Or it could mean: (2) “They settled in the presence of all their relatives.” Alternate translation: [They settledlived among all their relatives]; (3) “He died in the presence of all his brothers.” Alternate translation: [Ishmael died in the presence of his brothers] or [Ishmael died while all his brothers were still alive]
25:19	ldvn			וְ⁠אֵ֛לֶּה תּוֹלְדֹ֥ת יִצְחָ֖ק בֶּן־אַבְרָהָ֑ם	1	We have already heard about much of Isaac’s history in previous chapters; now we are told even more. See how you translated **these are the generations of** in [verse 12](../25/12.md) and Genesis [6:9](../06/09.md).

See how you translated **barren** in Genesis [11:30](../11/30.md). Also, it may be clearer to change the order of the clauses in this sentence to put them in the order in which they happened. Alternate translation: [Isaac prayed earnestly to Yahweh for his wife to have children because she was barren] or [But for many years Rebekah was not able to get pregnant, so Isaac prayed that Yahweh would give her children]

Alternate translation: [so that Rebekah became pregnant with twins]
25:22	df89			וַ⁠יִּתְרֹֽצֲצ֤וּ הַ⁠בָּנִים֙ בְּ⁠קִרְבָּ֔⁠הּ	1	Alternate translation: [And the two babies inside her kept pushing against each other] or [After a while the twins wrestled with each other inside her]

It may be necessary to translate it in slightly different ways, depending on the context. Alternate translation: [who hunted game meat and brought a meal to me?] or [who brought to me a meal made from wild animal meat?]

If your language would not use that form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

And God will surely bless him] or [Then I asked God to bless him, so God will definitely bless him]

If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. To help readers understand why Esau said this about Jacob, you could include a footnote such as the following: The name **Jacob** means “heel-grabber” and can imply deception. He was given that name because when he was born he was grabbing hold of Esau’s heel (Genesis [25:26](../25/26.md)).

29:11	uwgl			וַ⁠יִּשַּׁ֥ק יַעֲקֹ֖ב לְ⁠רָחֵ֑ל	1	In that culture it was common to greet a relative with a kiss on the cheek (or both cheeks). However, if it would be offensive in your culture for Jacob to kiss Rachel here, you could translate this more generally (See: the second alternate translation above).

This rhetorical question expects the implied answer “No, of course not!” Consider whether it is more natural in your language to use a statement here instead. Alternate translation: [Just because you are my nephew, does that mean that you should work for me without pay?] or [Even though you are my relative that does not mean that you should have to work for me for free!] or [You should not have to work for me for nothing just because you are my nephew!]

Do what is most clear and natural in your language. Alternate translation: [but to him it seemed like only a few days had passed because he loved her so much] or [but he loved her so much that to him the years seemed to pass quickly like only a few days]

Translate this in a way that is natural, clear, and acceptable for reading in public. Alternate translation: [so that he had sexual relations with Leah] or [so he slept with Leah] or [spent the night with her]
29:24	zehs			וַ⁠יִּתֵּ֤ן לָבָן֙	1	It is not clear in the Hebrew text when Laban gave Zilpah to Leah, so it is probably best to keep it that way in your translation. Some translations say that Laban “had already given” Zilpah to Leah before the wedding night. However according to Jewish history (outside the Bible), it was on the wedding night that Laban did this as part of his plan to deceive Jacob: Zilpah was younger than Bilhah, so everyone would expect her to be given to Rachel as the younger sister; seeing Zilpah (instead of Bilhah) would help Jacob think that his veiled bride was Rachel. Since we do not know for sure which interpretation is right, it is probably best to be like the Hebrew text and not specify when Laban gave Zilpah to Leah. Some translations put this verse in parentheses because it seems to interrupt the telling of the main events. Alternate translation: [In addition, Laban gave]

Also, make sure that your translation of **she** refers here to Leah, not Zilpah (who was mentioned in [verse 24](../29/24.md)). Alternate translation: [Jacob saw that his new wife was Leah!] or [Jacob was shocked to discover that it was Leah he had married!]
29:25	qd1f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר אֶל־לָבָ֗ן	1	Some languages use an honorific title such as “his father-in-law” here now that Jacob is married. Alternate translation: [So he complained to his father-in-law] or [So he rebuked Laban and said]

In that part of the world, most sheep were white and most goats were solid brown or black. So Jacob was asking for the irregular animals for himself, including white sheep with dark marks, dark-colored goats with light marks and dark-colored lambs. You could put some of this information in a footnote. Alternate translation: [all the lambs that have speckles or spots, or that are dark-colored]

Alternate translation: [whenever you check the animals you have given me]

Also, what Laban does in [verse 35](../30/35.md) does not follow the agreement he just made with Jacob in [verses 32-34](../30/32.md). Alternate translation: [But that very day, he removed from his flocks]

30:35	fnxm			כֹּ֤ל אֲשֶׁר־לָבָן֙ בּ֔⁠וֹ	1	The goats were normally dark brown or black, so if they had streaks or spots on them those marks would be white. In the Hebrew text, there is a pun (play-on-words) in [verses 35](../30/35.md) and 37: the name “Laban” means **white**, so [verse 35](../30/35.md) literally says that any goats with “Laban” (**white**) on them became Jacob’s. You could include that information in a footnote. Alternate translation: [any that had any white marks on them]

Alternate translation: [The flocks often mated when they came to the tubs to drink] or [That way, whenever the animals that were ready to breed came to the tubs to drink]
30:39	u4ep			וַ⁠יֶּחֱמ֥וּ הַ⁠צֹּ֖אן אֶל־הַ⁠מַּקְל֑וֹת	1	Make sure your translation of the verbs in this verse refers to a repeated or habitual activity, not a one-time event.

31:19	akjd			הָלַ֔ךְ לִ⁠גְזֹ֖ז אֶת־צֹאנ֑⁠וֹ	1	In that culture, sheep wool was very important since it was used to make clothing and blankets.

31:19	vfcm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֶת־הַ⁠תְּרָפִ֖ים אֲשֶׁ֥ר לְ⁠אָבִֽי⁠הָ	1	The author assumes that readers will know that these **idols** were statues made of wood or precious metals and were small enough to be used in a private home. You could say that explicitly if that would be helpful to your readers. In this chapter these statues are referred to as **idols** (in [verses 19](../31/19.md), [34](../31/34.md), [35](../31/35.md) when the author refers to them) and “gods” (in quotes in [verses 30](../31/30.md) and [32](../31/32.md) when Laban or Jacob talk about them). If it is confusing in your language to switch back and forth between these two terms, you could use “gods” throughout this chapter, since Laban would not have called them idols, and Jacob would not have used that term in his presence. However, if possible, it is best to translate the two terms the way the Hebrew text has them. Alternate translation: [his family gods] or [the gods that he had]

Make sure your translation of this verse does not sound like Jacob left a second time. To make this clear you could say, “After Jacob and his family ran away with everything that they owned, they quickly crossed the Euphrates River and headed toward the hill country of Gilead.” Alternate translation: [So Jacob and his family ran away]
31:21	zuha			וְ⁠כָל	1	Alternate translation: [with all] or [and took all]

Also see how you translated **Laban the Aramean** in [verse 20](../31/20.md).

31:53	kg7k			וֵֽ⁠אלֹהֵ֤י נָחוֹר֙ & אֱלֹהֵ֖י אֲבִי⁠הֶ֑ם	1	Abraham trusted in Yahweh, the one and only true God (Genesis [15:6](../15/06.md)). Terah worshiped other gods ([Joshua 24:2](../../jos/24/02.md)), and so did Laban ([verses 19](../31/19.md), [30](../31/30.md)), which suggests that Nahor served the same gods that his father Terah served, and then taught his son Laban to do the same thing. In spite of that, many translations still capitalize **God** all three times here in [verse 53](../31/53.md). Be consistent with how you spelled **Nahor** in the book of Genesis. See [11:22–25](../11/22.md), [29](../11/29.md); [12:26–27](../12/26.md); [22:20](../22/20.md), [24](../22/24.md), [28](../22/28.md); [24:9](../24/09.md), [15](../24/15.md), [24](../24/24.md), [47](../24/47.md); [29:5](../29/05.md); [31:53](../31/53.md).

31:53	d5h9			וַ⁠יִּשָּׁבַ֣ע יַעֲקֹ֔ב	1	Jacob refused to swear by the gods of Nahor and Terah. See how you translated **swore** in Genesis [26:31](../26/31.md), and compare that to how you translated a related phrase (“vowed a vow”) in [31:13](../31/13.md). Alternate translation: [But Jacob swore] or [But Jacob vowed a vow]
31:53	jtf2			בְּ⁠פַ֖חַד אָבִ֥י⁠ו יִצְחָֽק	1	See how you translated “the Fear of Isaac” in [verse 42](../31/42.md). Alternate translation: [by the God whom his father Isaac feared that he would keep their treaty] or [with the Fear of his father Isaac as his witness]
31:54	j4i6			וַ⁠יִּזְבַּ֨ח יַעֲקֹ֥ב זֶ֨בַח֙ בָּ⁠הָ֔ר	1	Make sure your translation does not sound like Jacob burned the animal while it was still alive. Also see how you translated **sacrificed** in Genesis [22:13](../22/13.md). Alternate translation: [and he offered an animal sacrifice to God on an altar on a hill] or [and Jacob burned the body of an animal on an altar as a sacrifice to God on a hill]

Some of that information could be included in a footnote. Alternate translation: [Then after they had eaten the meal, they spent the night there on the hill]
31:55	m83j			וַ⁠יַּשְׁכֵּ֨ם לָבָ֜ן בַּ⁠בֹּ֗קֶר	1	See how you translated a similar clause in Genesis [28:18](../28/18.md). Alternate translation: [The next morning Laban got up early]

32:1	jfda			וַ⁠יִּפְגְּעוּ־ב֖⁠וֹ מַלְאֲכֵ֥י אֱלֹהִֽים	1	Translate **met** in a way that allows for the fact that no conversation is recorded between the angels and Jacob and that the angels were probably not hostile; for example, they may have been sent by God to escort and protect him. Alternate translation: [and some angels from God encountered him]
32:2	a5gq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר יַעֲקֹב֙ כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֣ר רָאָ֔⁠ם	1	Make sure that you refer to Jacob and the angels here in a way that is accurate and natural in your language. Alternate translation: [When Jacob saw the angels, he said in surprise]

Also see how you translated **he called the name of that place** in Genesis [28:19](../28/19.md).

Do this in a way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [I want you to tell Esau whom I highly respect:]
32:4	iepc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	כֹּ֤ה אָמַר֙ עַבְדְּ⁠ךָ֣ יַעֲקֹ֔ב	1	[Verses 4](../32/04.md) and [5](../32/05.md) have two levels of embedded quotes.

32:19	t364			וַ⁠יְצַ֞ו גַּ֣ם	1	See how you translated **commanded** in [verse 17](../32/17.md). Alternate translation: [In the same way, Jacob instructed] or [Jacob gave the same orders to]
32:19	o5nc			אֶת־הַ⁠שֵּׁנִ֗י גַּ֚ם אֶת־הַ⁠שְּׁלִישִׁ֔י	1	Alternate translation: [the servant in charge of the second herd and the servant in charge of the third group] or [the servants who were in charge of the second and third herds of animals]
32:19	ig25			גַּ֚ם אֶת־כָּל־הַ⁠הֹ֣לְכִ֔ים אַחֲרֵ֥י הָ⁠עֲדָרִ֖ים לֵ⁠אמֹ֑ר	1	Alternate translation: [as well as all the other servants who were in charge of the other herds]

32:20	s0ro		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אֲכַפְּרָ֣ה פָנָ֗י⁠ו בַּ⁠מִּנְחָה֙	1	The idiom **cover his face** means to try to calm someone’s anger by doing something to please him. Consider whether your language has a similar idiom you could use here. Alternate translation: [I can pacify Esau by sending] or [Perhaps Esau will stop being angry at me if I send]
32:20	ne75		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	בַּ⁠מִּנְחָה֙ הַ⁠הֹלֶ֣כֶת לְ⁠פָנָ֔⁠י	1	For some languages it is more natural to use an indirect quote here and say, “because he thought that if he sent the gifts of animals ahead of himself to Esau, then Esau would stop being angry at him.” Notice that this alternate translation also changes the clause order. Alternate translation: [him this gift of animals ahead of me] or [this gift of animals to him ahead of me]
32:20	vaa1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	וְ⁠אַחֲרֵי־כֵן֙ אֶרְאֶ֣ה פָנָ֔י⁠ו אוּלַ֖י יִשָּׂ֥א פָנָֽ⁠י	1	Make sure that the way you translate this clause fits with how you translated the previous clauses as either a direct or indirect quote. Alternate translation: [After that, perhaps he will forgive me and welcome me when we see each other face to face]
32:21	r0gm			וַ⁠תַּעֲבֹ֥ר הַ⁠מִּנְחָ֖ה עַל־פָּנָ֑י⁠ו	1	See how you translated **gift** in [verses 13](../32/13.md), [18](../32/18.md), [20](../32/20.md). Alternate translation: [So the animal gifts for Esau were taken ahead of Jacob by his servants]
32:21	bq6f			וְ⁠ה֛וּא לָ֥ן בַּ⁠לַּֽיְלָה־הַ⁠ה֖וּא בַּֽ⁠מַּחֲנֶֽה	1	Alternate translation: [but Jacob and his family stayed behind at the camp that night] or [but Jacob himself slept for part of the night in the camp]
32:22	kfyv			וַ⁠יָּ֣קָם ׀ בַּ⁠לַּ֣יְלָה ה֗וּא	1	Make sure it is clear in your translation that this is the same night that was referred to in [verse 21](../32/21.md). Also, the phrase **got up** often refers to initiating an action, but here it may also imply that Jacob got up out of bed after sleeping for a while. Alternate translation: [Later that same night Jacob woke up and took] or [Sometime during that night]
32:22	fc8d			אֶת־שְׁתֵּ֤י נָשָׁי⁠ו֙ וְ⁠אֶת־שְׁתֵּ֣י שִׁפְחֹתָ֔י⁠ו וְ⁠אֶת־אַחַ֥ד עָשָׂ֖ר יְלָדָ֑י⁠ו	1	Consider what is the best way in your language to list these people. See what you did for a similar list of people in Genesis [7:13](../07/13.md). Alternate translation: [his two wives, two concubines and eleven sons]
32:22	b3kt			וַֽ⁠יַּעֲבֹ֔ר	1	Alternate translation: [and walked across]
32:22	e2wn			אֵ֖ת מַעֲבַ֥ר יַבֹּֽק	1	A ford is a very shallow place in a stream that is fairly easy and safe for people and animals to walk across. The Jabbok Stream was a small river that flowed from east to west into the Jordan River about halfway between the Dead Sea and the Sea of Galilee. Jacob took his wives and children from the north side of the stream to the south side; his brother was coming towards them from further south. It might be helpful to include a map here in your translation that includes the places named in this chapter and shows where Jacob and Esau were coming from. Alternate translation: [a shallow place on the Jabbok River] or [a place in the Jabbok Stream that was shallow]
32:23	xi98			וַ⁠יִּקָּחֵ֔⁠ם וַ⁠יַּֽעֲבִרֵ֖⁠ם אֶת־הַ⁠נָּ֑חַל	1	[Verse 23](../32/23.md) refers back to what already happened in [verse 22](../32/22.md). Make sure your translation does not sound like Jacob’s wives and children crossed the Jabbok Stream twice in [verses 22-23](../32/22.md). Alternate translation: [After he had taken them across the river] or [After he did that]
32:23	p97f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַֽ⁠יַּעֲבֵ֖ר אֶת־אֲשֶׁר־ל⁠וֹ	1	At some point, Jacob went back to the north side of the Jabbok Stream, while his family waited for him on the south side. His belongings included the animals that he had not sent ahead to Esau as well as all his other possessions. Alternate translation: [he went back and had his servants take everything that he owned across the river too] or [he went back and had his servants take all his livestock and other possessions across the river too]
32:24	vh2l			וַ⁠יִּוָּתֵ֥ר יַעֲקֹ֖ב לְ⁠בַדּ֑⁠וֹ	1	Alternate translation: [After that, Jacob was alone there for a while]
32:24	fwnb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	וַ⁠יֵּאָבֵ֥ק אִישׁ֙ עִמּ֔⁠וֹ	1	At some point, Jacob realized that this man was Yahweh in the form of a man ([verse 30](../32/30.md)), so translation teams that capitalize references to God will capitalize all the pronouns that refer to him in [verses 24-29](../32/24.md) and may or may not capitalize “Man” in these verses. See what you did for a similar case when Yahweh appeared as a man to Abraham in [Gen 18](../18/01.md). Alternate translation: [and then a man came and wrestled with him]
32:24	hyuk			עַ֖ד עֲל֥וֹת הַ⁠שָּֽׁחַר	1	The word **dawn** refers to the time before sunrise when the sky begins to get light. Alternate translation: [until dawn] or [until daylight started to appear]
32:25	ddzn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יַּ֗רְא כִּ֣י לֹ֤א יָכֹל֙ ל֔⁠וֹ	1	Make sure it is clear in your translation who is being referred to in [verses 25-29](../32/25.md).

Also consider whether it is more natural in your language to use a noun phrase or a pronoun here to refer to Jacob’s hip joint. Alternate translation: [so that it was put out of place] or [and his hip joint went out of place]
32:25	mc3x			בְּ⁠הֵֽאָבְק֖⁠וֹ עִמּֽ⁠וֹ	1	Alternate translation: [as he fought with the man] or [as they fought against each other]

32:26	y2gk			כִּ֥י עָלָ֖ה הַ⁠שָּׁ֑חַר	1	See how you translated “the dawn came up” in [verse 24](../32/24.md). Alternate translation: [because it is dawn] or [because daylight is beginning to come!]

32:27	xvcd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֖אמֶר יַעֲקֹֽב	1	Make sure in your translation that Jacob’s reply sounds respectful. Also consider whether it is better to use a direct or indirect quote here in your language.
32:28	twx4			וַ⁠יֹּ֗אמֶר	1	Alternate translation: [Then the man said to Jacob]
32:28	uf7y			לֹ֤א יַעֲקֹב֙ יֵאָמֵ֥ר עוֹד֙ שִׁמְ⁠ךָ֔	1	The wording here is similar to what God said when he changed Abram’s name to Abraham (Genesis [17:5](../17/05.md)) and Sarai’s name to Sarah ([17:15](../17/15.md)). After that, Abraham and Sarah were no longer called by their previous names. In the case of Jacob, he continues to be referred to by both of his names in this chapter (**Jacob** in [verses 29-30](../32/29.md), [32](../32/32.md); **Israel** in [verse 32](../32/32.md)) and throughout the rest of the Bible, including by God (Genesis [46:2](../46/02.md)). It could be that although God was changing Jacob’s primary name to “Israel,” he was still known by his previous name too. You could put some of that information in a footnote. Alternate translation: [You will no longer be named Jacob]
32:28	qbvn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	כִּ֖י אִם־יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל	1	If you include the meaning of the name **Israel** in your translation or in a footnote, make sure it fits with how you translate **struggled** in the following clause.
32:28	udk7			כִּֽי־שָׂרִ֧יתָ עִם־אֱלֹהִ֛ים וְ⁠עִם־אֲנָשִׁ֖ים	1	The Hebrew word for **struggled** here is more general than the word for “wrestled” in [verses 24](../32/24.md) and [25](../32/25.md). Alternate translation: [because you have struggled against both God and men]
32:28	yhdd			וַ⁠תּוּכָֽל	1	See how you translated **prevailed** in [verse 25](../32/25.md) and Genesis [30:8](../30/08.md). It may be necessary to translate this term in slightly different ways, depending on the context. Alternate translation: [and you have overcome]
32:29	bkfv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	וַ⁠יִּשְׁאַ֣ל יַעֲקֹ֗ב וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר֙	1	Consider again whether or not you have capitalized references to the man in [verses 24-29](../32/24.md). See the note about this at [verse 24](../32/24.md). Alternate translation: [Then Jacob asked him]
32:29	cidm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	הַגִּֽידָ⁠ה־נָּ֣א שְׁמֶ֔⁠ךָ	1	Consider whether it is better to use a direct or indirect quote here in your language. Alternate translation: [What is your name?] or [what his name was]
32:29	ct8s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֕אמֶר	1	Alternate translation: [But the man replied]
32:29	otq0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	לָ֥⁠מָּה זֶּ֖ה תִּשְׁאַ֣ל	1	This rhetorical question probably means that there was no need for Jacob to ask the man what his name was; he should have known without asking. Consider whether or not it is best to use a rhetorical question here in your language. Alternate translation: [You do not need to ask me]
32:29	gbbo			לִ⁠שְׁמִ֑⁠י	1	Alternate translation: [to tell you my name!]
32:30	fpdv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	רָאִ֤יתִי אֱלֹהִים֙ פָּנִ֣ים אֶל־פָּנִ֔ים	1	Alternate translation: [I saw God in person here]
32:30	qdf5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠תִּנָּצֵ֖ל נַפְשִֽׁ⁠י	1	The author assumes that readers will know that Jacob was amazed that he was still alive because, although there were exceptions ([Exodus 33:11](../../exo/33/11.md); [Judges 13:22](../../jdg/13/22.md)), normally people could not see God face to face and live ([Exodus 33:20](../../exo/33/20.md)). You could put that information in a footnote so that readers understand why Jacob was surprised. Alternate translation: [but yet my life was spared by him!]
32:31	s3cw			וַ⁠יִּֽזְרַֽח־ל֣⁠וֹ הַ⁠שֶּׁ֔מֶשׁ	1	Alternate translation: [The sun shined on Jacob] or [The sun was rising]
32:31	qtbh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֥ר עָבַ֖ר אֶת־פְּנוּאֵ֑ל	1	Penuel is another name for the place that is called Peniel in [verse 30](../32/30.md). That information could be put in a footnote. Or you could use the same spelling in both verses to avoid confusion; **Penuel** is the spelling in the rest of the Old Testament. Alternate translation: [as he left Penuel and returned to his family]
32:31	kp04			וְ⁠ה֥וּא צֹלֵ֖עַ	1	Alternate translation: [As he walked, he was limping]

32:32	asw5			לֹֽא־יֹאכְל֨וּ & אֶת־גִּ֣יד הַ⁠נָּשֶׁ֗ה	1	Alternate translation: [do not eat the tendon]

33:1	kz1u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּשָּׂ֨א יַעֲקֹ֜ב עֵינָ֗י⁠ו וַ⁠יַּרְא֙	1	Make sure your translation of this idiom does not mean that Jacob looked straight up. Rather, he probably looked carefully to the south (the direction that his brother was coming from). Alternate translation: [Then Jacob looked up and saw] or [Then Jacob looked ahead of him and saw]
33:1	ilei			וְ⁠הִנֵּ֣ה עֵשָׂ֣ו בָּ֔א	1	Esau was still a fair distance away, which gave Jacob time to do everything that he does in [verses 1-3](../33/01.md). Alternate translation: [that Esau was in the distance coming his way]
33:1	ozjn			וְ⁠עִמּ֕⁠וֹ אַרְבַּ֥ע מֵא֖וֹת אִ֑ישׁ	1	Alternate translation: [with 400 men!] or [and that he had 400 men with him!]

See how you translated **divided** in Genesis [32:7](../32/07.md) and “his two maidservants” in Genesis [32:22](../32/22.md). Alternate translation: [So he quickly put his children into groups with their own mothers, Leah, Rachel and his two servant wives] or [So he had his children quickly gather with their own mothers, so that Leah, Rachel and his two concubines were each with her own children]
33:2	iser			וַ⁠יָּ֧שֶׂם אֶת־הַ⁠שְּׁפָח֛וֹת וְ⁠אֶת־יַלְדֵי⁠הֶ֖ן	1	See how you translated “his two maidservants” in Genesis [32:22](../32/22.md). Alternate translation: [He put his two servant wives with their children] or [He put the group that had his two servant wives and their children]
33:2	v7cd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	רִֽאשֹׁנָ֑ה	1	For some languages it is more natural to put phrases like **first** and **after them** at the beginning of their clauses and say, “First in line he put his two servant wives and/with their children. Behind them he put Leah and/with her children, and last of all he put Rachel and/with her son Joseph.” Alternate translation: [in front of all the others]

Alternate translation: [and he bowed with his face to the ground seven times to show respect as he went closer to him] or [As he approached Esau, he prostrated himself with his face to the ground seven times to show respect]
33:4	unbx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וַ⁠יָּ֨רָץ עֵשָׂ֤ו לִ⁠קְרָאת⁠וֹ֙ וַֽ⁠יְחַבְּקֵ֔⁠הוּ	1	This sentence shows a contrast between what Jacob was expecting and what actually happened.

Make sure that the way you translate **fell on his neck** does not imply that Esau accidentally fell. Rather, this is an idiom that means he embraced Jacob warmly, with much emotion. Alternate translation: [and he threw his arms around his shoulders and kissed him] or [He held Jacob tightly and kissed him on the cheek]
33:4	nnax		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	וַ⁠יִּבְכּֽוּ	1	Also, some languages have a dual pronoun for **they** that could be used here. Alternate translation: [and they both cried for joy] or [Both of them cried because they were so happy to see each other again]
33:5	xxbt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּשָּׂ֣א אֶת־עֵינָ֗י⁠ו	1	See how you translated the idiom “lifted … eyes” in [verse 1](../33/01.md) and Genesis [31:10](../31/10.md). It may be necessary to translate this idiom in different ways, depending on the context. Alternate translation: [Then Esau looked up]

For some languages it is more natural to put the honorific title first in this sentence and say, “Sir, they are the wives and children whom God has graciously given to me.” Alternate translation: [whom God has kindly given to me, your servant] or [whom God has graciously given to me, sir]
33:6	c9es			וַ⁠תִּגַּ֧שְׁןָ הַ⁠שְּׁפָח֛וֹת הֵ֥נָּה וְ⁠יַלְדֵי⁠הֶ֖ן	1	See how you translated **maidservants** in [verses 1-2](../33/01.md). Alternate translation: [Then the two maidservants came closer to Esau along with their children]

Some languages also have a special term for “younger brother” that fits well here. Alternate translation: [My brother, I already own enough livestock]
33:9	hmaj			יְהִ֥י לְ⁠ךָ֖ אֲשֶׁר־לָֽ⁠ךְ	1	Alternate translation: [Keep what you own for yourself] or [so keep your livestock for yourself]
33:10	vlw8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר יַעֲקֹ֗ב	1	Alternate translation: [But Jacob responded to him]
33:10	tfke			אַל־נָא֙	1	In [verses 10](../33/10.md) and [11](../33/11.md), Jacob speaks urgently to Esau, because in that culture if Esau accepts Jacob’s gift, he is committing himself to treat Jacob as a friend. Alternate translation: [No, I beg you]
33:10	stzb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וְ⁠לָקַחְתָּ֥ מִנְחָתִ֖⁠י מִ⁠יָּדִ֑⁠י	1	Alternate translation: [please accept from me what I have given you]

However, God had been gracious to Jacob and allowed him to live (Genesis [32:30](../32/30.md)). In the same way, it was a terrifying thing for Jacob to see Esau who had 400 men with him, but Esau was gracious to him ([33:4](../33/04.md)). See how you translated a different Hebrew word that means “receive” or “welcome” in Genesis [32:20](../32/20.md). Alternate translation: [I thought you were still angry at me, so I was afraid of seeing you again in person, just as I would be afraid of meeting God in person, but you forgave me and welcomed me!]
33:11	zfgz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	קַח־נָ֤א אֶת־בִּרְכָתִ⁠י֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר הֻבָ֣את לָ֔⁠ךְ	1	Alternate translation: [So please accept my gift of livestock that my servants brought to you] or [So please accept the livestock from me that I sent to you]

33:11	toi0			וְ⁠כִ֣י יֶשׁ־לִ⁠י־כֹ֑ל	1	Alternate translation: [and he has given me everything that I need] or [so that I own all that I need]
33:11	dx0h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יִּפְצַר־בּ֖⁠וֹ	1	Make sure it is clear in your translation who and what is being referred to at every point in this sentence. Alternate translation: [He kept urging him to accept his gift] or [He kept insisting that he accept the livestock from him]
33:11	fs6g			וַ⁠יִּקָּֽח	1	Alternate translation: [until finally Esau accepted it]
33:12	j0up			וַ⁠יֹּ֖אמֶר	1	Alternate translation: [Then Esau said to Jacob]
33:12	zjf4			וְ⁠אֵלְכָ֖ה לְ⁠נֶגְדֶּֽ⁠ךָ	1	Esau is suggesting that he would accompany or escort Jacob and his family, not that he would go far ahead of them. Alternate translation: [and I will lead you]

33:13	ci2o			אֲדֹנִ֤⁠י יֹדֵ֨עַ֙ כִּֽי	1	See how you translated “my lord” in [verse 8](../33/08.md). Alternate translation: [Sir, you know that]

33:13	xg08			וְ⁠הַ⁠צֹּ֥אן וְ⁠הַ⁠בָּקָ֖ר עָל֣וֹת עָלָ֑⁠י	1	See how you translated “flocks and herds” in Genesis [12:16](../12/16.md). Alternate translation: [and some of my sheep and cattle are nursing their young]
33:13	gbse			וּ⁠דְפָקוּ⁠ם֙ י֣וֹם אֶחָ֔ד	1	Alternate translation: [If my men drive the livestock too hard in one day] or [If I force the livestock to go too fast for even one day]
33:13	c17q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	וָ⁠מֵ֖תוּ כָּל־הַ⁠צֹּֽאן	1	This phrase especially refers to the sheep and cattle that were nursing, but Jacob is probably using exaggeration here (**all**) to emphasize that he does not want to travel too fast. Alternate translation: [then all the flocks and herds will die] or [then all of them will die]
33:14	g9ie		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	יַעֲבָר־נָ֥א אֲדֹנִ֖⁠י לִ⁠פְנֵ֣י עַבְדּ֑⁠וֹ	1	See how you translated Jacob’s use of **my lord** (in [verse 8](../33/08.md)) and **servant** (in [verse 5](../33/05.md)) to show respect and deference to Esau. Here he uses both terms for emphasis.
33:14	qgdi			וַ⁠אֲנִ֞י אֶֽתְנָהֲלָ֣ה לְ⁠אִטִּ֗⁠י לְ⁠רֶ֨גֶל הַ⁠מְּלָאכָ֤ה אֲשֶׁר־לְ⁠פָנַ⁠י֙ וּ⁠לְ⁠רֶ֣גֶל הַ⁠יְלָדִ֔ים	1	Alternate translation: [Then I will travel along slowly at a speed that is good for the livestock and children that are with me]
33:14	lafk			עַ֛ד אֲשֶׁר־אָבֹ֥א אֶל־אֲדֹנִ֖⁠י	1	Alternate translation: [until we reach you, sir] or [We will catch up to you later, sir]
33:14	tb57			שֵׂעִֽירָ⁠ה	1	See how you translated “the land of Seir” in Genesis [32:3](../32/03.md). The land of Seir was a mountainous region southeast of the land of Canaan (and the Dead Sea) and was where Esau had settled. It was also called “Edom” (Genesis [32:3](../32/03.md)), which was Esau’s nickname (Genesis [25:30](../25/30.md)). You could put some of that information in a footnote. Alternate translation: [in the land of Seir]
33:15	twql			וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר עֵשָׂ֔ו	1	Alternate translation: [Then Esau said to Jacob]
33:15	ku53			אַצִּֽיגָה־נָּ֣א עִמְּ⁠ךָ֔ מִן־הָ⁠עָ֖ם אֲשֶׁ֣ר אִתִּ֑⁠י	1	Alternate translation: [Okay, then please let me leave you some of my men to escort you] or [Okay, then may I leave some of my men with you to escort you?]
33:15	phvo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֨אמֶר֙	1	Make sure the way you translate this quote margin fits with how you translate the previous and following sentences. Alternate translation: [Jacob said to him] or [Jacob answered him]
33:15	a29j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	לָ֣⁠מָּה זֶּ֔ה	1	Jacob uses a rhetorical question here to emphasize that there is no need for Esau to leave any of his men with him. For some languages it is clearer and more natural to use a statement here instead.
33:15	evmh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	אֶמְצָא־חֵ֖ן בְּ⁠עֵינֵ֥י אֲדֹנִֽ⁠י	1	Consider again how you translated **my lord** in [verses 8](../33/08.md),[13-15](../33/13.md). For some languages it is more natural to put this address earlier in this quote. Also see how you translated the idiom **find favor in the eyes of** in [verse 8](../33/08.md). Alternate translation: [Just please continue to be gracious to me, sir] or [Sir, please just continue to treat me kindly]
33:16	r6yz			וַ⁠יָּשָׁב֩ בַּ⁠יּ֨וֹם הַ⁠ה֥וּא עֵשָׂ֛ו לְ⁠דַרְכּ֖⁠וֹ	1	Alternate translation: [So that very day Esau and his men started on their way back] or [So that very day Esau and his men left and headed back]
33:16	c592			שֵׂעִֽירָ⁠ה	1	See how you translated **Seir** in [verse 14](../33/14.md). Alternate translation: [home to the region of Seir]
33:17	moff		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וְ⁠יַעֲקֹב֙ נָסַ֣ע סֻכֹּ֔תָ⁠ה	1	Jacob went northwest to Succoth, instead of going south to the region of Seir as he had said he would do ([verse 14](../33/14.md)). Also see how you translated “travel” in [verse 12](../33/12.md). Alternate translation: [But Jacob went to the town of Succoth instead] or [Meanwhile, instead of going to Seir, Jacob and his family went to the town of Succoth]
33:17	moyc			וַ⁠יִּ֥בֶן ל֖⁠וֹ בָּ֑יִת	1	Alternate translation: [There he and his servants built a house for himself and his family] or [where he and his men built a house for his family]
33:17	kw1x			וּ⁠לְ⁠מִקְנֵ֨⁠הוּ֙ עָשָׂ֣ה סֻכֹּ֔ת	1	The term **livestock** is general here and includes all of Jacob’s animals. Alternate translation: [and they also built some shelters for his livestock] or [and shelters for his animals]
33:17	oyhe			עַל־כֵּ֛ן	1	See how you translated this phrase in Genesis [32:32](../32/32.md). Alternate translation: [Because of that]
33:17	tv48		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	קָרָ֥א שֵׁם־הַ⁠מָּק֖וֹם סֻכּֽוֹת	1	The phrase “he/they called” could refer to Jacob, or it could refer to people in general (as it often does in Genesis). If you include the meaning of the name Succoth in your translation or in a footnote, make sure it matches the way you translate **shelters** earlier in this verse.
33:18	uqlg			וַ⁠יָּבֹא֩ יַעֲקֹ֨ב שָׁלֵ֜ם עִ֣יר שְׁכֶ֗ם אֲשֶׁר֙ בְּ⁠אֶ֣רֶץ כְּנַ֔עַן בְּ⁠בֹא֖⁠וֹ מִ⁠פַּדַּ֣ן אֲרָ֑ם	1	Jacob and his family had left Paddan Aram and had been traveling back to the land of his ancestors in Canaan (Genesis [31:3](../31/03.md), [13](../31/13.md), [18](../31/18.md)). See how you translated **in peace** in Genesis [28:21](../28/21.md). Alternate translation: [Later Jacob and his family arrived safely at the city of Shechem in the land of Canaan, as he continued traveling home from the region of Paddan Aram] or [After that, Jacob and his family continued their journey home from the region of Paddan Aram, until eventually they arrived safely at the city of Shechem in the land of Canaan]
33:18	q3jx			וַ⁠יִּ֖חַן	1	See how you translated **camped** in Genesis [26:17](../26/17.md). Alternate translation: [and he set up camp in a field] or [Then he set up his tents in a field]

Some ancient translations (including the LXX and Latin Vulgate) have “a hundred lambs” here, but most modern translations have “a hundred pieces of silver.” Alternate translation: [for one hundred pieces of money from the sons of Hamor who was the father of Shechem]
33:20	lob7			וַ⁠יַּצֶּב־שָׁ֖ם מִזְבֵּ֑חַ	1	See how you translated **altar** in Genesis [26:25](../26/25.md). Alternate translation: [On that land Jacob also built a stone altar] or [Jacob also made an altar out of stones on that land]
33:20	e6k2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	וַ⁠יִּ֨קְרָא־ל֔⁠וֹ אֵ֖ל אֱלֹהֵ֥י יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	The name **El Elohe Israel** could also mean “Powerful/Mighty is the God of Israel,” because the Hebrew word **El** can mean “God” or “powerful.” You could put that information in a footnote.
34:1	xwzi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠תֵּצֵ֤א דִינָה֙ בַּת־לֵאָ֔ה אֲשֶׁ֥ר יָלְדָ֖ה לְ⁠יַעֲקֹ֑ב	1	These events took place at an unspecified time after Jacob and his family set up their camp beside the city of Shechem (Genesis [33:18](../33/18.md)). Consider what is the best way to introduce a new event in your language. Also be consistent here with how you spelled **Dinah** in Genesis [30:21](../30/21.md). Alternate translation: [Now one day Dinah, who was the daughter whom Leah had for Jacob, went out] or [One day, Dinah, who was the daughter of Jacob and Leah, went to the city]
34:1	da5z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לִ⁠רְא֖וֹת	1	The idiom **to see** could mean: (1) “to visit with”; many languages have a similar idiom. (2) “to see or observe” the local women, for example, how they dressed and what jewelry they wore.
34:1	xo8b			בִּ⁠בְנ֥וֹת הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	See how you translated **daughters of the land** in Genesis [27:46](../27/46.md), and how you translated a similar phrase (“people of the land”) in Genesis [23:7](../23/07.md), [12](../23/12.md). Alternate translation: [some of the women who were native to that area] or [some of the native women]

Also see how you translated “Hivites” in Genesis [10:17](../10/17.md) and **ruler** in Genesis [25:16](../25/16.md). Alternate translation: [Then Shechem, who was the son of the Hivite named Hamor who ruled that region, saw] or [Now the ruler of that region was a Hivite named Hamor. His son Shechem saw]
34:2	ht9l			אֹתָ֜⁠הּ & וַ⁠יִּקַּ֥ח אֹתָ֛⁠הּ	1	Alternate translation: [Dinah, and he grabbed hold of her] or [how beautiful Dinah was, so he took hold of her]
34:2	ptfl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	וַ⁠יִּשְׁכַּ֥ב אֹתָ֖⁠הּ וַ⁠יְעַנֶּֽ⁠הָ	1	This is a euphemistic way of saying that Shechem forced Dinah to have sex with him. Translate this in a way that will not offend or embarrass people, especially when hearing your translation read aloud. Alternate translation: [and forced her to go to bed with him]
34:3	nd16			וַ⁠יְדַבֵּ֖ר עַל־לֵ֥ב הַֽ⁠נַּעֲרָֽ	1	See how you translated **young woman** in Genesis [24:14](../24/14.md), and see the note about that there. Alternate translation: [and spoke tenderly to her to try to persuade her] or [and tried to win her heart by speaking kindly to her]
34:4	q2v0			וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר שְׁכֶ֔ם אֶל־חֲמ֥וֹר אָבִ֖י⁠ו לֵ⁠אמֹ֑ר	1	Alternate translation: [Then Shechem went to his father Hamor and requested]
34:4	u0r8			קַֽח־לִ֛⁠י אֶת־הַ⁠יַּלְדָּ֥ה הַ⁠זֹּ֖את לְ⁠אִשָּֽׁה	1	At that time it was normal for parents to negotiate with another family to get a spouse for their child. The negotiations would include a bride-price and other details. You could put some of that information in a footnote. The term **girl** that Shechem uses here is less respectful than the term “young woman” that is used in [verses 3](../34/03.md) and [12](../34/12.md).
34:5	ern7			וְ⁠יַעֲקֹ֣ב שָׁמַ֗ע כִּ֤י	1	Alternate translation: [When Jacob was told by someone that]

34:5	b462			וְ⁠הֶחֱרִ֥שׁ יַעֲקֹ֖ב	1	Make sure your translation of this phrase does not mean that Jacob was totally silent. Rather, it means he did not speak about what Shechem had done to Dinah.
34:5	vahs			עַד־בֹּאָֽ⁠ם	1	Alternate translation: [until they came back home]
34:6	huzm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֵּצֵ֛א חֲמ֥וֹר אֲבִֽי־שְׁכֶ֖ם	1	For some languages it is more natural to introduce Shechem here, rather than wait and have him appear too suddenly in [verse 11](../34/11.md).
34:6	fxey			אֶֽל־יַעֲקֹ֑ב לְ⁠דַבֵּ֖ר אִתּֽ⁠וֹ	1	Alternate translation: [to talk with Jacob]
34:7	ydmu			כְּ⁠שָׁמְעָ֔⁠ם	1	Many translations put “when they heard” with the previous sentence. However, unless someone else told Jacob’s sons the news of what happened, that interpretation contradicts [verse 5](../34/05.md), which says that Jacob kept quiet about it until his sons got home. Alternate translation: [When they heard that Shechem had raped their sister]
34:7	cnrm			וַ⁠יִּֽתְעַצְּבוּ֙ הָֽ⁠אֲנָשִׁ֔ים	1	See how you translated **grieved** in Genesis [6:6](../06/06.md). It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context. Alternate translation: [they were very shocked]

You could put that information in a footnote. Make sure that your translation of **Israel** does not refer here to a place, since Israel was not yet a country or a territory. Alternate translation: [that Shechem had disgraced the family of Israel]
34:7	wf5f			וְ⁠כֵ֖ן לֹ֥א יֵעָשֶֽׂה	1	Alternate translation: [Such a wicked thing should never be done by anyone!] or [No one should ever do such a wicked crime!]
34:8	omfw			וַ⁠יְדַבֵּ֥ר חֲמ֖וֹר אִתָּ֣⁠ם לֵ⁠אמֹ֑ר	1	Alternate translation: [But Hamor pleaded with Jacob and his sons and said] or [But Hamor begged Jacob and his sons]
34:8	ma3r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	בְּ⁠בִתְּ⁠כֶ֔ם	1	The pronoun **your** is plural here, which shows that Hamor is addressing not only Jacob but also his sons. Alternate translation: [My son Shechem has fallen completely in love with your daughter and sister]
34:8	sx6u			תְּנ֨וּ נָ֥א אֹתָ֛⁠הּ ל֖⁠וֹ לְ⁠אִשָּֽׁה	1	The way **give** and “take” are used in [verses 8](../34/08.md), [9](../34/09.md), [12](../34/12.md), [16](../34/16.md) and [21](../34/21.md) reflects the culture at that time, when parents or families arranged marriages for their daughters. Also see the note about this at [verse 4](../34/04.md). Alternate translation: [So please permit him to marry her]
34:9	fum0			בְּנֹֽתֵי⁠כֶם֙ תִּתְּנוּ־לָ֔⁠נוּ וְ⁠אֶת־בְּנֹתֵ֖י⁠נוּ תִּקְח֥וּ לָ⁠כֶֽם	1	Alternate translation: [so that your daughters will marry our young men and your young men will marry our daughters] or [so that you allow our young men to marry your daughters and we allow your young men to marry our daughters]
34:10	rrpa			וְ⁠אִתָּ֖⁠נוּ תֵּשֵׁ֑בוּ	1	Alternate translation: [You can also live among us] or [We also invite you to live among us]
34:10	x3fi			וְ⁠הָ⁠אָ֨רֶץ֙ תִּהְיֶ֣ה לִ⁠פְנֵי⁠כֶ֔ם שְׁבוּ֙ וּ⁠סְחָר֔וּ⁠הָ	1	Normally foreigners were not allowed to own land or to move around in the land to trade freely. So that is why Hamor is offering this in exchange for Jacob allowing his family to intermarry with the Hivites. Alternate translation: [The land is available for you to choose what you want; settle in it wherever you want. You can also trade freely here] or [You can settle wherever you want in the land. You can also do business buying and selling things wherever you want]

34:12	l9mr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	הַרְבּ֨וּ עָלַ֤⁠י מְאֹד֙ מֹ֣הַר וּ⁠מַתָּ֔ן	1	The **dowry** was the payment that a groom (and his family) had to give to the bride’s family. It could include things like money, land, and livestock. The term **gift** probably refers to additional gifts given to the bride and her family members (as in Genesis [24:53](../24/53.md)). If the custom of paying a dowry is not known in your culture, you could include an explanation in a footnote. Alternate translation: [Set the dowry and wedding gifts that I must pay to marry her as high as you want]
34:12	zoy5			וְ⁠אֶ֨תְּנָ֔ה כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֥ר תֹּאמְר֖וּ אֵלָ֑⁠י	1	See how you translated a similar clause in [verse 11](../34/11.md). Alternate translation: [and I will give you whatever you ask from me]

Alternate translation: [to let our sister marry a man like you who has not had his foreskin removed] or [to allow a man like you who is not circumcised to marry our sister]
34:14	guat			כִּֽי־חֶרְפָּ֥ה הִ֖וא לָֽ⁠נוּ	1	Alternate translation: [because that would humiliate our family!] or [That would cause great shame to our family!]

Also see how you translated “give … daughters … take … daughters …” in [verse 9](../34/09.md). Alternate translation: [Then we will let our daughters marry your young men, and our young men will marry your daughters] or [After you do that, then we will allow your young men to marry our daughters, and we will allow your daughters to marry our young men]

If you have an inclusive form of this pronoun in your language, you could use it here. Alternate translation: [and as a result we will all be one ethnic group]
34:17	p6xy			וְ⁠אִם־לֹ֧א תִשְׁמְע֛וּ אֵלֵ֖י⁠נוּ לְ⁠הִמּ֑וֹל	1	Alternate translation: [But if you do not circumcise your males as we say]
34:17	o476			וְ⁠לָקַ֥חְנוּ אֶת־בִּתֵּ֖⁠נוּ וְ⁠הָלָֽכְנוּ	1	The phrase **our daughter** reflects the fact that Jacob’s sons are using their father’s perspective and authority here. If that is confusing, you could say “our sister” instead. See how you translated “our family’s daughter” in [verse 8](../34/08.md). Alternate translation: [then we will leave and take our sister with us]

34:20	cgfe			וַֽ⁠יְדַבְּר֛וּ אֶל־אַנְשֵׁ֥י עִירָ֖⁠ם לֵ⁠אמֹֽר	1	In that culture the leaders of a city held their meetings at the main city gates (as in Genesis [23:3](../23/03.md)). Cities were surrounded by walls (that had gates) for protection. You could put some of that information in a footnote so that people understand what was happening. Alternate translation: [and they spoke to the city elders who had gathered there. They said] or [and they told the leaders of their city about Jacob and his sons]

Even though Shechem was the one who actually defiled Dinah ([verses 2](../34/02.md), [5](../34/05.md), [7](../34/07.md), [13](../34/13.md)), Jacob’s sons held everyone in the city responsible for the crime that their ruler’s son had committed ([verses 25-29](../34/25.md)). If that is not clear, you could put that information in a footnote. Make sure that your translation of **they** does not refer to Jacob’s sons. Alternate translation: [They did that because that was where Shechem had disgraced their sister] or [to get revenge for the shameful thing that had been done to their sister there]
34:28	u9bb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	אֶת־צֹאנָ֥⁠ם וְ⁠אֶת־בְּקָרָ֖⁠ם וְ⁠אֶת־חֲמֹרֵי⁠הֶּ֑ם וְ⁠אֵ֧ת אֲשֶׁר־בָּ⁠עִ֛יר וְ⁠אֶת־אֲשֶׁ֥ר בַּ⁠שָּׂדֶ֖ה לָקָֽחוּ	1	See how you translated **donkeys** in Genesis [32:15](../32/15.md).

Some languages have a similar idiom that fits well here. Also see how you translated **the Canaanites** and **the Perizzites** in Genesis [13:7](../13/07.md); [15:20–21](../15/20.md). There were other people groups also living in the land, but these two groups are the ones being emphasized here. Alternate translation: [by causing the people who live in this land to despise us, including the Canaanites and Perizzites!] or [by causing the Canaanites and Perizzites who live in this land to hate me]

35:1	j11q			עֲלֵ֥ה בֵֽית־אֵ֖ל וְ⁠שֶׁב־שָׁ֑ם	1	The verb **go up** reflects the fact that the town of Bethel is higher in elevation than the city of Shechem; it does not refer to the direction they were going, which was south. Many translations leave **up** implied (to prevent confusion). Alternate translation: [and travel to the town of Bethel and live there]
35:1	a8t3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠עֲשֵׂה־שָׁ֣ם מִזְבֵּ֔חַ	1	See how you translated **altar** in Genesis [33:20](../33/20.md).

35:2	ftw0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	הָסִ֜רוּ אֶת־אֱלֹהֵ֤י הַ⁠נֵּכָר֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר בְּ⁠תֹכְ⁠כֶ֔ם	1	By **foreign gods**, Jacob means the idols that came to the Jews from the non-Hebrew people with whom the Jews had dwelt and even intermarried. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. See how you translated “idols” and **gods** in Genesis [31:19](../31/19.md), [30](../31/30.md), [32](../31/32.md). Alternate translation: [Get rid of the idols you have that pagan ethnic groups worship] or [Give up the idols that you have from foreigners]

35:3	jdob			וְ⁠אֶֽעֱשֶׂה־שָּׁ֣ם מִזְבֵּ֗חַ לָ⁠אֵ֞ל	1	The Hebrew text has **I** here, but probably also implies that others in Jacob’s household would help him build the altar. Also see how you translated **make an altar** in [verse 1](../35/01.md). Alternate translation: [where I will build an altar to worship God] or [There I will build an altar and worship God]

35:3	qw4q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בְּ⁠י֣וֹם צָֽרָתִ֔⁠י	1	The phrase “In the day of” is used here as an idiom that could refer to the time when Jacob was fleeing from Esau, or it could be more general and also include other times when Jacob was suffering, such as the years he worked for Laban. Alternate translation: [during the days when I was in trouble]
35:3	mk28		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יְהִי֙ עִמָּדִ֔⁠י	1	See how you translated the idiom **with me** in Genesis [31:5](../31/05.md), where it also means that God is not only present with him but also helps him and takes care of him.

35:3	gaoi			בַּ⁠דֶּ֖רֶךְ אֲשֶׁ֥ר הָלָֽכְתִּי	1	Alternate translation: [everywhere that I have gone]

35:4	trzi			אֵ֣ת כָּל־אֱלֹהֵ֤י הַ⁠נֵּכָר֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר בְּ⁠יָדָ֔⁠ם	1	See how you translated **foreign gods** in [verse 2](../35/02.md). You could translate this differently here since this is the second time they are mentioned in this paragraph. Alternate translation: [all the pagan gods that they had with them]
35:4	emli		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠אֶת־הַ⁠נְּזָמִ֖ים אֲשֶׁ֣ר בְּ⁠אָזְנֵי⁠הֶ֑ם	1	The implication is that these earrings were part of their idol worship and may have had images of their idols on them. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [and the earrings they wore on their ears]

35:4	qkq2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	הָ⁠אֵלָ֖ה	1	Although this phrase refers to a terebinth tree, many translations have “oak tree” instead, or some other type of large, strong tree that is well known. See how you translated a different Hebrew word that is also translated **terebinth tree** or “oak tree” in Genesis [12:6](../12/06.md); [13:18](../13/18.md); [14:13](../14/13.md); [18:1](../18/01.md). Another Hebrew word in Genesis [35:8](../35/08.md) is also translated as “oak.” Alternate translation: [a oak tree]
35:5	w4f2			וַ⁠יִּסָּ֑עוּ	1	Alternate translation: [Then they all left there and started traveling]
35:5	bc7c			וַ⁠יְהִ֣י ׀ חִתַּ֣ת אֱלֹהִ֗ים עַל־הֶֽ⁠עָרִים֙ אֲשֶׁר֙ סְבִיבֹ֣תֵי⁠הֶ֔ם וְ⁠לֹ֣א	1	The Hebrew word “Elohim” probably means **God** in this phrase (as it usually does in the Bible); most English versions translate it that way here. Or it could be an adjective that modifies “dread/terror” and means “great/deep dread/terror” (similar to Genesis [23:6](../23/06.md), [30:8](../30/08.md)). See how you translated **dread** in Genesis [9:2](../09/02.md). Alternate translation: [and God caused the people in the nearby cities to be afraid, so that] or [and God made the people in the nearby cities so afraid that]

35:6	r8n3			וַ⁠יָּבֹ֨א יַעֲקֹ֜ב ל֗וּזָ⁠ה	1	Be consistent in this verse with how you spelled **Luz** and **Bethel** in Genesis [28:19](../28/19.md). Alternate translation: [Soon Jacob arrived at the town of Luz]
35:6	zpbn			הִ֖וא בֵּֽית־אֵ֑ל	1	See how you translated **which is** in Genesis [23:2](../23/02.md), [19](../23/19.md). Alternate translation: [which is also called Bethel] or [that is, Bethel] or [which now has the name Bethel]
35:6	e1f7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	אֲשֶׁר֙ בְּ⁠אֶ֣רֶץ כְּנַ֔עַן	1	Since Shechem ([verse 4](../35/04.md)) and Bethel were both in the land or region of Canaan, for some languages it is clearer or more natural to put this location phrase earlier in the verse and say, “Jacob/He and his family continued traveling in the land/region of Canaan and arrived at the town of Luz, which also/now has the name Bethel,” Alternate translation: [which is also in Canaan]
35:6	rsay		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	ה֖וּא וְ⁠כָל־הָ⁠עָ֥ם אֲשֶׁר־עִמּֽ⁠וֹ	1	For some languages it is clearer or more natural to put this phrase near the beginning of this verse. Alternate translation: [he and his whole family]

35:8	psgk			וַ⁠תָּ֤מָת דְּבֹרָה֙ מֵינֶ֣קֶת רִבְקָ֔ה	1	See how you translated **nurse** in Genesis [24:59](../24/59.md).
35:8	cnph			וַ⁠תִּקָּבֵ֛ר	1	Alternate translation: [and her body was buried by Jacob in the ground] or [They buried her body in the ground]
35:8	gwdm			מִ⁠תַּ֥חַת לְ⁠בֵֽית־אֵ֖ל	1	The town of Bethel was built on a hill, so the phrase **below Bethel** means that Deborah was buried near Bethel, in a valley or place that was lower in elevation than the town, and possibly to the south of it. Alternate translation: [in the valley below the town of Bethel] or [at a place south of the town of Bethel]
35:8	h6bn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	תַּ֣חַת הָֽ⁠אַלּ֑וֹן	1	See how you translated a similar phrase (“under the terebinth/oak tree”) in [verse 4](../35/04.md). Many translations translate this phrase the same way in both places (“under an oak tree”), even though different Hebrew words are used for the type of tree. Also, for some languages it is more natural to put this phrase before the previous phrase and say, “at the base of an oak tree, below/near the town of Bethel.” Alternate translation: [beside an oak tree] or [at the foot of an oak tree]
35:8	eqj9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֥א שְׁמ֖⁠וֹ	1	**So he called its name** could mean: (1) that Jacob was the one who named the place. See how you translated a similar clause in Genesis [31:38](../31/38.md). Alternate translation: [So he named the tree]; (2) that people in general called the tree or place Allon Bacuth. Alternate translation: [That is why the place is known as]
35:8	iar1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	אַלּ֥וֹן בָּכֽוּת	1	If you include the meaning of this name in your translation text or in a footnote, make sure it fits with how you translated **oak tree** in the previous sentence.
35:9	tchm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	וַ⁠יֵּרָ֨א אֱלֹהִ֤ים אֶֽל־יַעֲקֹב֙ ע֔וֹד בְּ⁠בֹא֖⁠וֹ מִ⁠פַּדַּ֣ן אֲרָ֑ם	1	Alternate translation: [Now that Jacob had come from the land of Paddan Aram, God appeared to him at Bethel again] or [Now that Jacob had returned to Bethel from the land of Paddan Aram, God appeared to him there again]
35:9	w0t6			וַ⁠יְבָ֖רֶךְ אֹתֽ⁠וֹ	1	Alternate translation: [and showed his goodness toward him]
35:10	q9rk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּֽאמֶר־ל֥⁠וֹ אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	What God says to Jacob in [verses 10-12](../35/10.md) is the blessing. So make sure your translation of “blessed” ([verse 9](../35/09.md)) and **said** ([verse 10](../35/10.md)) refers to the same event, not two separate events. See how you translated “blessed … and said” in Genesis [1:28](../01/28.md). Alternate translation: [by saying to him]
35:10	bpj9			שִׁמְ⁠ךָ֣ יַעֲקֹ֑ב	1	Make sure your translation of this clause does not sound like God was telling Jacob something he did not know.
35:10	qyzi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	לֹֽא־יִקָּרֵא֩ שִׁמְ⁠ךָ֨ ע֜וֹד יַעֲקֹ֗ב	1	Notice that Jacob is referred to by both of his names in this chapter (**Jacob** in [verses 11-20](../35/11.md), [22-29](../35/22.md); **Israel** in [verses 10](../35/10.md) and [21](../35/21.md)). You could put that information in a footnote. Also see how you translated this clause in Genesis [32:28](../32/28.md), and see the note about Jacob’s names there. Alternate translation: [that will no longer be your only name] or [it will no longer be that name]
35:10	nvm1			כִּ֤י אִם־יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ יִהְיֶ֣ה שְׁמֶ֔⁠ךָ	1	Alternate translation: [Rather, your name will also be Israel!] or [Rather, you will also have the name Israel!]
35:10	kx9b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֥א אֶת־שְׁמ֖⁠וֹ יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	This was not the first time God had given Jacob the name Israel (See: Genesis [32:28](../32/28.md)). To make that clear, you could make “once again” explicit here.
35:11	ni4y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּאמֶר֩ ל֨⁠וֹ אֱלֹהִ֜ים	1	In [verse 11](../35/11.md), God continues the blessing that he started in [verse 10](../35/10.md), perhaps after a pause. Alternate translation: [Then God also said to him] or [Then God also blessed him by saying] or [God continued blessing him by saying to him]
35:11	mdi4			פְּרֵ֣ה	1	Consider again how you translated **Be fruitful and multiply** in the book of Genesis. See [1:22](../01/22.md), [28](../01/28.md); [8:17](../08/17.md); [9:1](../09/01.md), [7](../09/07.md); [35:11](../35/11.md). It may be necessary to translate this phrase in different ways, depending on the context.
35:11	ko42			וּ⁠רְבֵ֔ה	1	Alternate translation: [and increase in number] or [so that you and your descendants become very many]
35:11	uzb9			גּ֛וֹי וּ⁠קְהַ֥ל גּוֹיִ֖ם יִהְיֶ֣ה מִמֶּ֑⁠ךָּ	1	Compare how you translated a similar phrase (“a multitude of nations”) in Genesis [17:4–5](../17/04.md) and another similar phrase (“a community of peoples”) in Genesis [28:3](../28/03.md). Alternate translation: [Your descendants will become a large people group. In fact, many ethnic groups will descend from you] or [Your descendants will become many ethnic groups]
35:11	ztcs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	וּ⁠מְלָכִ֖ים מֵ⁠חֲלָצֶ֥י⁠ךָ יֵצֵֽאוּ	1	The phrase **come from your loins** is an idiom that refers to having children, grandchildren and other descendants. Consider whether you have a similar idiom in your language. Alternate translation: [and kings will descend from you]
35:12	wfzz			וְ⁠אֶת־הָ⁠אָ֗רֶץ אֲשֶׁ֥ר נָתַ֛תִּי לְ⁠אַבְרָהָ֥ם וּ⁠לְ⁠יִצְחָ֖ק לְ⁠ךָ֣ אֶתְּנֶ֑⁠נָּה וּֽ⁠לְ⁠זַרְעֲ⁠ךָ֥ אַחֲרֶ֖י⁠ךָ אֶתֵּ֥ן אֶת־הָ⁠אָֽרֶץ	1	Alternate translation: [Also, I am giving to you the land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac, and I will also give it to your descendants who live after you]

35:14	vufy			בַּ⁠מָּק֛וֹם אֲשֶׁר־דִּבֶּ֥ר אִתּ֖⁠וֹ מַצֶּ֣בֶת אָ֑בֶן	1	Alternate translation: [at the place where God had spoken to him, to mark the place as special] or [as a memorial stone to remember the place where God had talked to him]

See how you translated “poured oil on …” in Genesis [28:18](../28/18.md). Alternate translation: [Then he poured some wine and some olive oil on the stone pillar to thank God and dedicate the place to him]
35:15	r8mu			וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֨א יַעֲקֹ֜ב אֶת־שֵׁ֣ם הַ⁠מָּק֗וֹם אֲשֶׁר֩ דִּבֶּ֨ר אִתּ֥⁠וֹ & אֱלֹהִ֖ים בֵּֽית־אֵֽל	1	See how you translated “called the name of that place Bethel” in Genesis [28:19](../28/19.md).
35:16	zgdt			וַ⁠יִּסְעוּ֙ מִ⁠בֵּ֣ית אֵ֔ל	1	Be consistent here with how you spelled **Bethel** throughout the book of Genesis and whether you refer to it as a town or a city. See [12:8](../12/08.md); [13:3](../13/03.md); [28:19](../28/19.md); [31:13](../31/13.md); [35:1](../35/01.md), [3](../35/03.md), [7](../35/07.md), [15](../35/15.md), [16](../35/16.md). Alternate translation: [Then they left the town of Bethel] or [Later Jacob and his family moved on from the town of Bethel]
35:16	pluk			וַֽ⁠יְהִי־ע֥וֹד כִּבְרַת־הָ⁠אָ֖רֶץ לָ⁠ב֣וֹא אֶפְרָ֑תָה	1	The phrase **a distance of land** is very general, but your translation should not make it sound like the distance was too far, because Rachel’s grave is about two kilometers (one mile) from Ephrath (Bethlehem). Alternate translation: [and started heading toward the town of Ephrath. But while they were still a distance away from there]
35:16	hid6			וַ⁠תְּקַ֥שׁ בְּ⁠לִדְתָּֽ⁠הּ	1	Alternate translation: [but she was having a very difficult time delivering the baby]
35:17	lkqs			וַ⁠יְהִ֥י בְ⁠הַקְשֹׁתָ֖⁠הּ בְּ⁠לִדְתָּ֑⁠הּ	1	The phrase **hard labor** refers to when childbirth contractions are close together and very painful, often right before a baby is born. Alternate translation: [Then when she was at the most difficult time in her labor] or [Then when her childbirth pains were the most severe]
35:17	ojel			וַ⁠תֹּ֨אמֶר לָ֤⁠הּ הַ⁠מְיַלֶּ֨דֶת֙	1	Alternate translation: [the midwife told her] or [the baby was born and the midwife who was helping her deliver exclaimed to her]

35:17	uww0			כִּֽי־גַם־זֶ֥ה לָ֖⁠ךְ בֵּֽן	1	Alternate translation: [You now have another boy!] or [You just gave birth to another son]
35:18	ob0k			וַ⁠יְהִ֞י בְּ⁠צֵ֤את נַפְשָׁ⁠הּ֙ כִּ֣י מֵ֔תָה	1	Some translations use an idiom here, for example, “as she was taking her last breath” or “as her life was slipping/fading away,” but it is best to translate this in a way that preserves the biblical teaching that at death the soul or spirit leaves the body. Alternate translation: [But Rachel was dying, and as her soul was leaving her body] or [But in fact Rachel was about to die, and just before her soul left her]
35:18	lpc6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	וַ⁠תִּקְרָ֥א שְׁמ֖⁠וֹ בֶּן־אוֹנִ֑י	1	The meaning of this name could imply that the child caused Rachel’s death. In the Hebrew text this name is two words connected with a dash (**Ben-oni**). Many translations write it that way or as one word (“Benoni”), and a few translations write it as “Ben Oni.” Any of these spellings is fine.
35:18	yl7o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠אָבִ֖י⁠ו	1	The pronoun **his** refers to Jacob. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers.
35:18	qoiz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	קָֽרָא־ל֥⁠וֹ בִנְיָמִֽין	1	The phrase “son of my right hand” is an idiom that means “favored son” or “son of strength.” Alternate translation: [named him Benjamin instead]

35:19	u8c3			בְּ⁠דֶ֣רֶךְ אֶפְרָ֔תָה	1	Alternate translation: [beside the road that goes to the town of Ephrath]
35:19	v561			הִ֖וא בֵּ֥ית לָֽחֶם	1	See how you translated a similar phrase (“which is Bethel”) in [verse 6](../35/06.md). Alternate translation: [which is also called Bethlehem] or [that is, Bethlehem]
35:20	zolc			וַ⁠יַּצֵּ֧ב יַעֲקֹ֛ב מַצֵּבָ֖ה	1	See how you translated this clause in [verse 14](../35/14.md). Also consider again how you translated **set up** and **pillar** in the book of Genesis. See [28:18](../28/18.md), [22](../28/22.md); [31:13](../31/13.md), [45](../31/45.md), [51](../31/51.md), [52](../31/52.md); [35:14](../35/14.md), [20](../35/20.md). Alternate translation: [Jacob set a large stone up on its end]
35:20	tkgx			עַל־קְבֻרָתָ֑⁠הּ	1	Alternate translation: [over her burial place to show where it was] or [to show where her tomb was] or [to mark the place where he had buried her body]
35:20	r7ta			עַד־הַ⁠יּֽוֹם	1	The phrase **to this day** refers to the time when the author (Moses) was living. Even in modern times, Rachel’s grave is still marked beside the road about eight kilometers (five miles) south of Jerusalem and two kilometers (one mile) north of Bethlehem. Alternate translation: [in the present day] or [now]
35:21	e4g9			וַ⁠יִּסַּ֖ע יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל	1	Make sure it is clear in your translation or in a footnote that **Israel** ([verses 21-22](../35/21.md)) and “Jacob” ([verses 20](../35/20.md), [22](../35/22.md)) refer to the same person, not two different people. Alternate translation: [Then Israel that is, Jacob, and his family moved on from there] or [Then Israel and his family started traveling again]
35:21	sykf			וַ⁠יֵּ֣ט אָֽהֳלֹ֔⁠ה	1	Alternate translation: [and put up his tents]
35:21	fueh			מֵ⁠הָ֖לְאָה	1	This phrase reflects the perspective of Jacob, who was traveling south. Alternate translation: [on the other side of]
35:21	txka		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	לְ⁠מִגְדַּל־עֵֽדֶר	1	Many translations transliterate **Migdal Eder** (like most other names). Many others translate the meaning of **Migdal** as “the tower” and transliterate “Eder.” A few translate the meaning of the entire name as “the Tower of the Flock.” This was apparently a place near Bethlehem where sheep were raised ([Micah 4:8](../../mic/04/08.md)); shepherds may have watched over their flocks from the tower. Alternate translation: [Eder Tower]
35:22	ls6b			וַ⁠יְהִ֗י בִּ⁠שְׁכֹּ֤ן יִשְׂרָאֵל֙	1	Alternate translation: [While Israel and his family were still living] or [During the time that they were living]

35:23	fjpl			בְּנֵ֣י לֵאָ֔ה	1	Throughout [verses 23-26](../35/23.md), many translations have a colon (:) instead of **were**. See what you did in [chapter 10](../10/01.md). Alternate translation: [The sons he had with his wife Leah were] or [These are the names of the sons he had with his wife Leah:]
35:24	poyp			בְּנֵ֣י רָחֵ֔ל יוֹסֵ֖ף וּ⁠בִנְיָמִֽן	1	Alternate translation: [The sons Jacob had with Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin] or [These are the names of the sons that Jacob had with his wife Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin]

It may be necessary to translate this word in slightly different ways, depending on the context. Compare that to how you translated a different Hebrew word that has a similar meaning (“slave/servant woman”); see [31:33](../31/33.md) for a list of where this word occurs in Genesis.
35:26	f1fu			אֵ֚לֶּה בְּנֵ֣י יַעֲקֹ֔ב אֲשֶׁ֥ר יֻלַּד־ל֖⁠וֹ	1	Alternate translation: [All those were the sons Jacob had]
35:26	cmuu			בְּ⁠פַדַּ֥ן אֲרָֽם	1	Jacob started having children during the time he was living with Laban in Paddan Aram, but his last son Benjamin was not born until after they had left there ([verse 18](../35/18.md)). Translate this in a way that allows for that.
35:27	qidz			וַ⁠יָּבֹ֤א יַעֲקֹב֙ אֶל־יִצְחָ֣ק אָבִ֔י⁠ו	1	Alternate translation: [Then Jacob came home to his father Isaac who was living] or [Then Jacob continued traveling and came to where his father Isaac was living]

35:27	b5zj			קִרְיַ֣ת הָֽאַרְבַּ֑ע הִ֣וא חֶבְר֔וֹן	1	See how you translated Genesis [23:2](../23/02.md), which says that Kiriath Arba (where Sarah died) was also known as Hebron.

35:29	e7q5			וַ⁠יֵּאָ֣סֶף אֶל	1	See how you translated this phrase in Genesis [25:8](../25/08.md) and [17](../35/17.md). Alternate translation: [and he was taken by God to be with] or [and God took his spirit to be with]
35:29	hm56			עַמָּ֔י⁠ו	1	Alternate translation: [his relatives who had already died] or [his relatives who had gone before him] or [his deceased relatives]
35:29	csuc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	זָקֵ֖ן וּ⁠שְׂבַ֣ע יָמִ֑ים	1	For some languages it is more natural to put this phrase earlier in this sentence and say, “Then, after living a long, full life, he breathed/took his last breath, died and joined his ancestors/relatives who had died before him.” Alternate translation: [He was very old and had lived a long, full life]

36:1	r16h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ה֥וּא אֱדֽוֹם	1	The name Edom means “red” and is the nickname that Esau got for trading his birthright to Jacob for some reddish-colored stew (Genesis [25:29–34](../25/29.md)). The region of Edom and the Edomites were named after Esau, which is probably why this chapter repeatedly mentions that Esau is Edom. Alternate translation: [who was also called Edom] or [that is, Edom]
36:2	guw8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	עֵשָׂ֛ו לָקַ֥ח אֶת־נָשָׁ֖י⁠ו מִ⁠בְּנ֣וֹת כְּנָ֑עַן	1	Only the first two wives mentioned in this chapter were Canaanites; see the comment about Basemath at [verse 3](../36/03.md). The Canaanites were the descendants of Noah’s grandson Canaan (Ham’s son) and included the Hittites and Hivites ([verse 2](../36/02.md); Genesis [10:15–18](../10/15.md)) and several other people groups. You could put some of that information in a footnote. Alternate translation: [Esau had chosen two of his wives from among the Canaanite women:] or [Esau had married two women who were descendants of Canaan]
36:2	ox2j			אֶת־עָדָ֗ה	1	Alternate translation: [whose names were Adah]

See how you translated “Hittites” in Genesis [27:46](../27/46.md). Alternate translation: [whose father was Elon, who was a descendant of Heth] or [the daughter of a man named Elon, who was a member of the Heth people group]
36:2	y896			וְ⁠אֶת־אָהֳלִֽיבָמָה֙	1	Notice that the names of Esau’s two Canaanite wives here are different from the names of his wives mentioned in Genesis [26:34](../26/34.md). It could be that they each had two names, or these may be different wives that he married later. Alternate translation: [and also Oholibamah] or [as well as Oholibamah]
36:2	eq37		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	בַּת־עֲנָ֔ה בַּת	1	Notice that Elon, Anah, and Zibeon are the names of men here, not women.
36:2	evi6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	צִבְע֖וֹן הַֽ⁠חִוִּֽי	1	Make sure that your translation of this phrase does not sound like Zibeon was the only Hivite. Consider again how you translated “Hivites” in the book of Genesis. See [10:17](../10/17.md); [34:2](../34/02.md); [36:2](../36/02.md). Alternate translation: [Zibeon who was a descendant of Hivi] or [Zibeon who was a member of the Hivi people group]
36:3	x22q			וְ⁠אֶת־בָּשְׂמַ֥ת	1	Since this Basemath was a daughter of Ishmael (who was a descendant of Noah’s son Shem), she was not a Canaanite, in contrast to Esau’s first two wives ([verse 2](../36/02.md)).

Some translations (and ancient versions such as SP, LXX, Syriac, and Vulgate) have “Hadad” here instead, in order to spell this name the same way it is spelled in [1 Chronicles 36:Chronicles](../../1ch/36/Chronicles.md). However, that could cause confusion, because “Hadad” is also the name of a different king in [verses 35-36](../36/35.md) above.
36:39	aq30			וַ⁠יִּמְלֹ֤ךְ תַּחְתָּי⁠ו֙	1	Consider again how you translated this phrase in [verses 33-39](../36/33.md). Alternate translation: [took his place as king] or [succeeded him as king]

Also, consider whether or not it is better in your language to break up this long sentence into two shorter sentences. Alternate translation: [more of the chiefs who descended from Esau. These chiefs led their own family groups in their own territories, which were named after them:] or [more of the descendants of Esau who were tribal leaders; the tribes and the regions where they lived were named after them:]

(1) Most translations treat all the names in [verses 40-43](../36/40.md) as the names of chiefs (as in the ULT and UST of these verses). (2) However, some scholars think that all the names in [verses 40-43](../36/40.md) are the names of regions or clans. Alternate translation: [These were the names of the clans that descended from Esau. Each clan lived in the land of Edom in its own region that was named after that clan. The names of the clans of the Edomites were TImna, Alvah, Jetheth]
36:41	mpl5			אַלּ֧וּף אָהֳלִיבָמָ֛ה אַלּ֥וּף אֵלָ֖ה אַלּ֥וּף פִּינֹֽן	1	Make sure that the way you translate [verses 41-43](../36/41.md) fits with the interpretation you followed in [verse 40](../36/40.md).

Also compare how you translated the names of other people groups in this chapter, including “Hittite” and “Hivite” in [verse 2](../36/02.md); **Edomites** in [verse 9](../36/09.md); “Horite/Horites” in [verses 20](../36/20.md), [21](../36/21.md), [29](../36/29.md), [30](../36/30.md); “Temanites” in [verse 34](../36/34.md); and “Midianites” in [verse 35](../36/35.md).

Begin this chapter in a way that is natural in your language. Make sure the way you translate **lived** allows for the fact that Jacob was already living in Canaan and had settled near the city of Hebron, where his father and grandfather had lived previously (Genesis [35:27](../35/27.md)). Alternate translation: [Now Jacob was still living]
37:1	u237			בְּ⁠אֶ֖רֶץ מְגוּרֵ֣י אָבִ֑י⁠ו בְּ⁠אֶ֖רֶץ כְּנָֽעַן	1	See how you translated “sojourned” in Genesis [35:27](../35/27.md) and **the land of Canaan** in Genesis [35:6](../35/06.md). Alternate translation: [in the land of Canaan where his father Isaac had lived for a while as a outsider]
37:2	iyds			אֵ֣לֶּה ׀ תֹּלְד֣וֹת יַעֲקֹ֗ב	1	Consider again how you translated **These are the generations of** in the book of Genesis. See [2:4](../02/04.md); [6:9](../06/09.md); [11:27](../11/27.md); [25:19](../25/19.md); [36:1](../36/01.md); [37:2](../37/02.md), where what follows is a narrative or history of events. Compare that to Genesis [5:1](../05/01.md); [10:1](../10/01.md); [11:10](../11/10.md); [25:12](../25/12.md); [36:9](../36/09.md), where what follows is more of a genealogy (list of names). It may be necessary to translate this phrase in different ways, depending on the context. Alternate translation: [This is more of the history about Jacob and his family:] or [What follows tells more about Jacob and his family:]
37:2	hh9m			יוֹסֵ֞ף בֶּן־שְׁבַֽע־עֶשְׂרֵ֤ה שָׁנָה֙	1	This verse may be referring to a single incident or it may be referring to what happened regularly.

37:2	xjuz			אֶת־אֶחָי⁠ו֙ & וְ⁠ה֣וּא נַ֗עַר אֶת	1	As the youngest of these brothers, Joseph was their helper as they took care of their father’s flocks. Alternate translation: [as an helper for his brothers who were]
37:2	ilb3			בְּנֵ֥י בִלְהָ֛ה וְ⁠אֶת־בְּנֵ֥י זִלְפָּ֖ה נְשֵׁ֣י אָבִ֑י⁠ו	1	Be consistent here with how you spelled **Bilhah** in Genesis [29:29](../29/29.md) and **Zilpah** in [29:24](../29/24.md).
37:2	i0ck		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יָּבֵ֥א יוֹסֵ֛ף אֶת־דִּבָּתָ֥⁠ם רָעָ֖ה אֶל־אֲבִי⁠הֶֽם	1	The Hebrew text does not specify what Joseph’s brothers had done wrong, so neither should your translation. Also, make sure your translation of **their father** does not sound like the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah had a different father than Joseph had. Alternate translation: [and he told his father about the bad things they were doing] or [and he gave bad reports to his father about them]
37:3	tws4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵ֗ל	1	This verse introduces background information for the events that happen next. Consider what is the best way to begin this sentence in your language. Make sure it is clear in your translation or in a footnote that Jacob ([verse 1](../37/01.md)) and Israel ([verse 3](../37/03.md)) refer to the same person, not two separate people. For a note about this, see [35:10](../35/10.md). Alternate translation: [Now Jacob, whose other name was Israel]
37:3	e4ha		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	כִּֽי־בֶן־זְקֻנִ֥ים ה֖וּא ל֑⁠וֹ	1	In certain contexts, biblical authors and characters use the common expression of their culture **son of** to indicate that a person has the characteristic of something. In this case, Joseph has the characteristic of being a son born to Israel late in life, in his old age. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [because Joseph was born to Israel in his later years]
37:3	ruov		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	וְ⁠עָ֥שָׂה ל֖⁠וֹ כְּתֹ֥נֶת פַּסִּֽים	1	The meaning of the Hebrew text translated as **multicolored tunic** is not certain here. Many translations (including the Greek Septuagint and Latin Vulgate) say that the tunic or robe was **multicolored** or “colorful.” This **tunic** was probably full-length to the ankles and had long sleeves that reached to the hands. Alternate translation: [So he made a beautiful tunic for him that had many colors] or [So he made a special colorful robe for him]
37:4	gxph		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַֽ⁠יִּשְׂנְא֖וּ אֹת֑⁠וֹ וְ⁠לֹ֥א יָכְל֖וּ דַּבְּר֥⁠וֹ לְ⁠שָׁלֹֽם	1	Make sure it is clear here in your translation that the brothers hated Joseph, not their father.

37:7	kj3d			אֲנַ֜חְנוּ מְאַלְּמִ֤ים אֲלֻמִּים֙ בְּ⁠ת֣וֹךְ הַ⁠שָּׂדֶ֔ה	1	A sheaf of grain is a bunch of grain stalks that have been cut and tied together in a bundle, with the heads of grain at the top. Wheat and barley were the grains that were common in this region at that time, not corn or oats. Alternate translation: [that we all were out in the middle of a field cutting stalks of grain and tying the stalks into sheaves] or [us working together out in a field cutting and tying sheaves of wheat stalks]
37:7	i9yf			אֲלֻמָּתִ֖⁠י	1	Alternate translation: [my sheaf of grain] or [the sheaf that I had made]

37:8	r10j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	תִּמְלֹךְ֙ עָלֵ֔י⁠נוּ	1	For languages that mark inclusive and exclusive pronouns, **us** excludes Joseph in this sentence. Alternate translation: [reign over us!]
37:8	xn5l			וַ⁠יּוֹסִ֤פוּ עוֹד֙ שְׂנֹ֣א אֹת֔⁠וֹ	1	Consider again how you translated **hate** in the book of Genesis. See Genesis [24:60](../24/60.md); [26:27](../26/27.md); [29:31](../29/31.md), [33](../29/33.md); [37:4–5](../37/04.md), [8](../37/08.md). It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context. Alternate translation: [So they despised him even more strongly than they did before]
37:8	hwgw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	עַל־חֲלֹמֹתָ֖י⁠ו וְ⁠עַל־דְּבָרָֽי⁠ו	1	For some languages, it is more natural to switch the order of clauses in this sentence and say, “So because of what he/Joseph had told them about his dreams, his brothers hated him even more strongly/intensely than they did before.” Alternate translation: [for his dreams and for what he told them about the dreams]
37:9	rdj8			וַ⁠יַּחֲלֹ֥ם עוֹד֙ חֲל֣וֹם אַחֵ֔ר וַ⁠יְסַפֵּ֥ר אֹת֖⁠וֹ לְ⁠אֶחָ֑י⁠ו	1	Alternate translation: [Sometime after that, Joseph told his brothers about another dream that he had]

37:9	utc0			מִֽשְׁתַּחֲוִ֖ים	1	See how you translated “bowed down” in [verse 7](../37/07.md). Alternate translation: [were bowing down to the ground]
37:9	qq77		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	לִֽ⁠י	1	Bowing down to someone was a way of showing respect and honor to that person. If that is not clear in your culture, you could make that information explicit in your translation or in a footnote. If it is understood, you can leave it implied (as the Hebrew text does). Alternate translation: [to me to show respect] or [in front of me to honor me]
37:10	sa4l			וַ⁠יְסַפֵּ֣ר אֶל־אָבִי⁠ו֮ וְ⁠אֶל־אֶחָי⁠ו֒	1	This could refer to: (1) a second time that Joseph told his dream. Alternate translation: [Then Joseph told the same dream to both his father and his brother]; (2) the same time that he told this dream to his brothers in [verse 9](../37/09.md). Alternate translation:  [When Joseph told the dream to his father and his brothers]

Alternate translation: [but his father rebuked him by saying]

37:15	oywm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	וַ⁠יִּמְצָאֵ֣⁠הוּ אִ֔ישׁ וְ⁠הִנֵּ֥ה	1	In this context **found** means the man happened to meet Joseph as Joseph was walking around looking for his brothers; the man was not intentionally looking for him. Also, for some languages it is clearer or more natural to change the order of the clauses in this sentence and say, “He started wandering around searching in the fields near there, where/and he met a man who asked …” or “As he was wandering around searching in the fields near there, he met a man who asked …” Alternate translation: [There he met a man who had seen him]

However, he may have paused between [verses 21](../37/21.md) and [22](../37/22.md) to see the effect of what he said in [verse 21](../37/21.md). Also, the repeated quote margin helps emphasize what he says in [verse 22](../37/22.md). Alternate translation: [Then he added]
37:22	t1mz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אַל־תִּשְׁפְּכוּ־דָם֒	1	See how you translated the idiom **shed blood** in Genesis [9:6](../09/06.md). Alternate translation: [Do not kill him]

37:27	d1rs			לַ⁠יִּשְׁמְעֵאלִ֗ים	1	See how you translated **Ishmaelites** in [verse 25](../37/25.md). Alternate translation: [to those Ishmaelites over there] or [to those Ishmaelite merchants over there]

However, sometimes (as here) the names of those people groups are used interchangeably (also see [Judges 8:22](../../jdg/08/22.md), [24](../../jdg/08/24.md), [26](../../jdg/08/26.md)). Perhaps that was because the two people groups had intermarried. Or there may have been merchants from the two people groups in this caravan who bought and sold Joseph together.

See how you translated a different word that has a similar meaning in Genesis [21:12](../21/12.md). Alternate translation: [The lad] or [Our younger brother]

The town of Adullam was about 19 kilometers (12 miles) northwest of the city of Hebron ([37:14](../37/14.md)), and was lower in elevation, which is why the text says that Judah **went down** to get there.

That way, they could produce a son who would carry on the deceased man’s family line and inherit his estate (See: [Deuteronomy 25:5–6](../../deu/25/05.md)).

Alternate translation: [As Joseph worked in his Egyptian master’s house, Yahweh was with Joseph and blessed him, so that he succeeded in everything he did]
39:3	eyfg			וַ⁠יַּ֣רְא אֲדֹנָ֔י⁠ו כִּ֥י יְהוָ֖ה אִתּ֑⁠וֹ	1	In [verses 2](../39/02.md) through 20, Potiphar is referred to as Joseph’s master ([verses 2-3](../39/02.md), [7-8](../39/07.md), [16](../39/16.md), [19-20](../39/19.md)) and “the Egyptian” ([verse 5](../39/05.md)); he is no longer mentioned by his name in the Hebrew text. Some translations continue to use Potiphar’s name occasionally in [verses 2](../39/02.md) through 20 to prevent confusion and make it clear that all of these references refer to the same person, not two or three different people. See how you translated **master** or “owner” in Genesis [24:9–10](../24/09.md).
39:3	o1le			וְ⁠כֹל֙ אֲשֶׁר־ה֣וּא עֹשֶׂ֔ה יְהוָ֖ה מַצְלִ֥יחַ בְּ⁠יָדֽ⁠וֹ	1	See how you translated **successful** in [verse 2](../39/02.md). Alternate translation: [and was helping Joseph to prosper in everything that he did] or [and was helping Joseph to do everything very well]

In the second clause of the first sentence, the pronoun **he** refers to Joseph, while the pronoun **him** refers to Potiphar. Alternate translation: [Since Joseph pleased Potiphar, he became Potiphar’s special servant]

Also see how you translated the idiom “gave … into the hand of” in Genesis [32:16](../32/16.md). Alternate translation: [He also put Joseph in charge of managing his household and taking care of everything else that he owned] or [He also appointed him as the overseer of his entire household and entrusted into his care everything that belonged to him]
39:5	vi9e			וַ⁠יְהִ֡י מֵ⁠אָז֩	1	Alternate translation: [Beginning from the time that]

Alternate translation: [including everything in his household and in his fields] or [including his family and servants in his household, as well as the crops and livestock in his fields]
39:5	nobj			וַ⁠יְהִ֞י בִּרְכַּ֤ת יְהוָה֙ בְּ⁠כָל־אֲשֶׁ֣ר יֶשׁ־ל֔⁠וֹ	1	Alternate translation: [Yahweh blessed everything that belonged to him] or [He caused everything that he owned to prosper]
39:5	p5qi			וַ⁠יְבָ֧רֶךְ יְהוָ֛ה אֶת־בֵּ֥ית הַ⁠מִּצְרִ֖י	1	Make sure it is clear in your translation of this chapter that “Egyptian,” “master,” and “Potiphar” all refer to the same person, not two or three different people.

Potiphar did more than decide what to eat; that was just one example of personal decisions which were all he had to concern himself with. Alternate translation: [the only things he needed to decide about in his household were personal things like what food he wanted to eat]

You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers.. Alternate translation: [As a result, even he does not exercise more authority in his household than I do]
39:9	vvmi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	וְ⁠לֹֽא־חָשַׂ֤ךְ מִמֶּ֨⁠נִּי֙ מְא֔וּמָה כִּ֥י אִם־אוֹתָ֖⁠ךְ בַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֣ר אַתְּ־אִשְׁתּ֑⁠וֹ	1	Joseph is using a figure of speech here that emphasizes a positive meaning by using a negative word, **not**, together with a mild expression that is the opposite of the intended meaning. If it would be helpful in your language, you could emphasize the positive meaning in a strong way. The phrase **has not withheld** emphasizes the freedom that Potiphar had given Joseph. Some languages must translate this in a way that does not use a negative word such as **not**. Alternate translation: [and he has given me freedom with everything in his household, except you, of course, because you are his wife]
39:9	py3p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וְ⁠אֵ֨יךְ אֶֽעֱשֶׂ֜ה הָ⁠רָעָ֤ה הַ⁠גְּדֹלָה֙ הַ⁠זֹּ֔את וְ⁠חָטָ֖אתִי לֵֽ⁠אלֹהִֽים	1	Joseph uses this rhetorical question to emphasize why he will not do what Potiphar’s wife wants.

Many English translations have omitted this phrase, possibly for reasons of naturalness. Consider whether you have an expression like this that is natural in your language.

Some of that information could be put in a footnote. Also, it may be more natural to include here in [verse 1](../40/01.md) the fact that these were the head officials in these jobs, rather than wait until [verse 2](../40/02.md) to introduce that. Alternate translation: [the chief wine-server and the chief baker for the king over Egypt] or [the man who was in charge of those who served wine to the king over Egypt and the man who was in charge of those who baked bread for the king]

Alternate translation: [the official in charge of serving wine to him and the official in charge of baking bread for him] or [his head wine-server and head baker] or [those two officials]
40:2	yt3s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	וַ⁠יִּקְצֹ֣ף פַּרְעֹ֔ה	1	Make sure it is clear in your translation that Pharaoh ([verse 2](../40/02.md)) is the same person as the king of Egypt ([verse 1](../40/01.md)). See how you translated **Pharaoh** in [Gen 12:15](../12/15.md), and see the important note about this there. Alternate translation: [So he] or [So the king]
40:3	sdsb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יִּתֵּ֨ן אֹתָ֜⁠ם	1	Often in the Bible (as here), when it says that a king (or someone else with authority) did something, it is implied that he had people who were under his authority actually do it.

40:3	dfne			בְּ⁠מִשְׁמַ֗ר	1	Alternate translation: [under guard]
40:3	e6e3			בֵּ֛ית שַׂ֥ר הַ⁠טַבָּחִ֖ים	1	Apparently the round-house prison was part of the house where the chief of the guards lived and worked, perhaps a lower part (See: Joseph’s use of the word “pit” in [verse 15](../40/15.md) to refer to this prison). See how you translated “chief/captain of the guards” in Genesis [37:36](../37/36.md) and [39:1](../39/01.md). Alternate translation: [in the house of the captain of the guards]

Or you could put this sentence earlier in this verse and say, “One night, the king of Egypt’s wine server and baker each had a dream while they were in prison, and each man’s/one’s dream had its own interpretation/meaning.” Make sure it is clear in your translation that the cupbearer and baker in [verse 5](../40/05.md) are the same officials as those in [verses 2-4](../40/02.md). Alternate translation: [This is talking about the wine-server and the baker, who had served the king of Egypt but were in prison]

Consider what is the best way to communicate that in your language. Alternate translation: [God is the only one who can explain the meaning of dreams] or [God is the only one who gives people the ability to interpret the meaning of dreams]
40:8	sy5s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	סַפְּרוּ־נָ֖א לִֽ⁠י	1	Make sure that your translation of the last two sentences in this verse does not sound like Joseph is claiming to be God. Rather, he is saying that if the two officials tell their dreams to him, God will enable him to interpret the dreams. Alternate translation: [Please tell your dreams to me and God will reveal to me what they mean]
40:9	qax1			וַ⁠יְסַפֵּ֧ר שַֽׂר־הַ⁠מַּשְׁקִ֛ים אֶת־חֲלֹמ֖⁠וֹ לְ⁠יוֹסֵ֑ף	1	See how you translated **chief of the cupbearers** in [verse 2](../40/02.md).

Alternate translation: [In my dream there was a vine] or [While I was dreaming, I saw a grapevine]

Alternate translation: [and Jacob greeted and blessed Pharaoh] or [and Jacob asked God to prosper Pharaoh] or [and Jacob greeted Pharaoh with a blessing]
47:8	rcjy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-politeness	כַּ⁠מָּ֕ה יְמֵ֖י שְׁנֵ֥י חַיֶּֽי⁠ךָ	1	Make sure your translation of Pharaoh’s question about Jacob’s age sounds polite.

If necessary, you could make that information explicit in your translation or put it in a footnote. Later in Egypt’s history, some of the Pharaohs were named Rameses and a city was named after one of them ([Exodus 1:11](../../exo/01/11.md)). Alternate translation: [So Joseph gave his father and his brothers the choicest land in the country of Egypt, and they and their families settled there. The property was in Rameses Count, that is, Goshen County] or [After that, Joseph helped his father and brothers settle in the country of Egypt. He gave them the choicest property in Egypt, which was in Goshen Province, also known as Rameses Province]
47:11	qnn5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	כַּ⁠אֲשֶׁ֖ר צִוָּ֥ה פַרְעֹֽה	1	It may be more natural to put this clause first in this verse and say, “After that, Joseph did what Pharaoh had commanded/told him to do: He helped his father and brothers settle in the country of Egypt. He gave them property in Rameses Province/County, that is, Goshen Province/County, which was the choicest land in Egypt.” Alternate translation: [just as Pharaoh had told him to do] or [He did exactly as Pharaoh had commanded him to do]
47:12	fz8t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	לֶ֖חֶם לְ⁠פִ֥י הַ⁠טָּֽף	1	The children are mentioned to emphasize that all the members of the families were well-provided for, including the youngest ones. Make sure it is clear in your translation that Joseph was providing food for everyone in each family, not just the children. Alternate translation: [food, based on how many children were in each family] or [as much food as each family needed to feed all the children in their family]
47:13	e2kb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	וְ⁠לֶ֤חֶם אֵין֙	1	This clause is probably an exaggeration to emphasize that there was so little food that the people were starving. Consider what is the best way to communicate that in your language. Also consider what is the best way in your language to begin this new section that returns to the famine and how it was progressing. Alternate translation: [Now meanwhile, there was no more food] or [Meanwhile, there was almost no food] or [After a while, there was very little food available]
47:13	wyew			בְּ⁠כָל־הָ⁠אָ֔רֶץ	1	This phrase is ambiguous in the Hebrew text. It could mean: (1) “in all the earth,” or “in the entire known world,” or “anywhere,” which might be an exaggeration (like the previous phrase); or (2) “in all the land,” or “in the/that entire area/region of the earth/world,” which includes Egypt and Canaan (mentioned later in the verse) and other nearby regions and countries. See how you translated **all the earth** in Genesis [41:57](../41/57.md).
47:13	k3zk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	כִּֽי־כָבֵ֥ד הָ⁠רָעָ֖ב מְאֹ֑ד	1	For some languages it may be clearer or more natural to put this clause first in this sentence and say, for example: “Now after a while, the famine was/became so severe/terrible in the entire world that there was very little food available anywhere.” Alternate translation: [because the famine was so severe]

Alternate translation: [As a result, the people in the country of Egypt and the region of Canaan] or [In fact, the people living in the lands of Egypt and Canaan]
47:13	jo5e			וַ⁠תֵּ֜לַהּ	1	The verb **languishing** refers in general to the suffering that the famine was causing, including things such as weakness, fainting and other distress. Some languages have an idiom (like “were wasting away”) that fits well here. Alternate translation: [were weak] or [were suffering terribly] or [were wasting away]
47:13	n055			מִ⁠פְּנֵ֖י הָ⁠רָעָֽב	1	Alternate translation: [because of the severe lack of food] or [from hunger]

Alternate translation: [So when all the silver in the country of Egypt and the region of Canaan had been used up] or [After the people in Egypt and Canaan had spent all their money]
47:15	j7jc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	כָל־מִצְרַ֨יִם	1	The word **all** is an exaggeration which emphasizes that a large number of Egyptians went to Joseph.

47:15	n6v7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	וַ⁠יָּבֹאוּ֩ & אֶל־יוֹסֵ֤ף	1	Consider whether **came** or “went” is more natural here in your language.

47:15	rqhs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	כִּ֥י אָפֵ֖ס כָּֽסֶף	1	It may be more natural to put this clause first in this quote and say, “Sir, we have no more money to buy grain/food!

Also notice that this address is used three times in this verse to show extra respect to Joseph. Consider what is the best way to do that in your language. Alternate translation: [Our lord we cannot hide from you the fact that]
47:18	ejez			תַּ֣ם הַ⁠כֶּ֔סֶף וּ⁠מִקְנֵ֥ה הַ⁠בְּהֵמָ֖ה	1	Consider again how you translated **silver** in the book of Genesis.

It may be necessary to translate this word in different ways, depending on the context. Alternate translation: [our money is gone and our animals] or [not only is our silver all gone, but all our animals also]
47:18	qh1k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	אֶל־אֲדֹנִ֑⁠י	1	In this verse, the people use the third person (“my/our lord”) to address Joseph in a respectful manner. Consider what is the best way to do that in your language. Alternate translation: [belong to you, our lord] or [are yours, sir]

It is different from the word for “land” in the rest of this chapter (in [verses 1](../47/01.md), [4](../47/04.md), [6](../47/06.md), [11](../47/11.md), [13-15](../47/13.md), [27-28](../47/27.md)).

The end of [verse 19](../47/19.md) specifies how the land would “die.” See how you translated a similar rhetorical question in [verse 15](../47/15.md). Alternate translation: [What good would it do for us to die and our fields to become ruined] or [Please do not just watch us die or let our land become empty]

For some languages, it may be clearer or more natural to change the order of clauses in this verse and say, “The famine was very severe for all the Egyptian people, so Joseph agreed with their request/suggestion and let them sell their fields to him in exchange for grain/food. In that way, Joseph/he bought/acquired all the land/farmland in the country of Egypt for King Pharaoh, so that all the land became Pharaoh’s property.” Alternate translation: [was very severe] or [was so severe that they did not have enough to eat]

The Samaritan Pentateuch (a different Hebrew version) and the Septuagint (Greek translation of the Hebrew text) have “made the people slaves” instead, which may refer to the fact that all the people would now be working for Pharaoh, since all the fields belonged to him. The textual variant that is not used in your translation could be put in a footnote. Alternate translation: [Joseph also moved all the people from their farmlands to the nearby cities]

Alternate translation: [concerning the fields in the country of Egypt: one-fifth of the crops belongs to Pharaoh] or [that required people to give to Pharaoh one-fifth of all the crops they harvested from the farmland in Egypt]

Also, consider again how you translated “land/farmland” in [verses 18-26](../47/18.md). Alternate translation: [The only land that Pharaoh did not own was the land that belonged to the priests]
47:26	vlkk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	עַד־הַ⁠יּ֨וֹם הַ⁠זֶּ֜ה	1	This phrase refers to the time that Moses was writing the book of Genesis. You could put that information in a footnote. For some languages it may be clearer or more natural to put this phrase at the end of the sentence and say, “That law is still in effect/force today/now.” Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: [that is still in force now]
47:27	kj0a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-background	וַ⁠יֵּ֧שֶׁב	1	It was already mentioned in [verse 11](../47/11.md) that Israel (Jacob) had settled in the country of Egypt. Your translation of [verse 27](../47/27.md) should not imply that he settled there again. Alternate translation: [So] or [Meanwhile]
47:27	qzr7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יִשְׂרָאֵ֛ל	1	The name **Israel** and the name “Jacob” refer to the same person. To make that clear, you could make “Jacob” explicit here in your translation or in a footnote. Alternate translation: [Israel that is, Jacob]

See how you translated an idiom with a similar meaning in Genesis [15:15](../15/15.md). Alternate translation: [When I die and rest with my ancestors] or [Rather, after I die and join my ancestors who have gone before me]
47:30	u4cf			וּ⁠נְשָׂאתַ֨⁠נִי֙ מִ⁠מִּצְרַ֔יִם	1	See how you translated **me** in [verse 29](../47/29.md). Alternate translation: [carry my body out of Egypt to the region of Canaan]
47:30	t1jw			וּ⁠קְבַרְתַּ֖⁠נִי בִּ⁠קְבֻרָתָ֑⁠ם	1	Jacob is referring here to the cave near the city of Hebron that Abraham had bought as a family burial place, to bury Sarah there. Abraham, Isaac and Rebekah were also buried there (Genesis [23:19–20](../23/19.md); [25:9–10](../25/09.md); [49:31](../49/31.md)). You could put some of that information in a footnote. Also see how you translated “grave” in Genesis [35:20](../35/20.md) and a different word with a similar meaning (“burial place”) in Genesis [23:4](../23/04.md), [6](../23/06.md), [9](../23/09.md), [20](../23/20.md). Alternate translation: [and bury me in the same burial place where their bodies are]
47:30	qkdh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֹּאמַ֕ר	1	Make sure it is clear in your translation that Joseph is the one speaking here. It may be helpful to read this paragraph aloud to make sure it is clear who is talking at each point in the conversation. Alternate translation: [Then Joseph replied to him]
47:30	mrsq			אָנֹכִ֖י אֶֽעֱשֶׂ֥ה כִ⁠דְבָרֶֽ⁠ךָ	1	Alternate translation: [I will do as you requested of me] or [I will do exactly what you asked me to do]
47:31	q5cz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יֹּ֗אמֶר	1	Consider what is the best way to refer to Joseph’s father Israel here in your language. Alternate translation: [But he urged him]
47:31	lxyf			הִשָּֽׁבְעָ⁠ה֙ לִ֔⁠י	1	See how you translated “swear to me” in Genesis [21:23](../21/23.md). Alternate translation: [Vow to me by Yahweh that you will do it] or [With God as your witness, make an oath to me that you will do it]

47:31	y3zf			עַל־רֹ֥אשׁ הַ⁠מִּטָּֽה	1	The Hebrew text has **at the head of the bed** here, while the Septuagint (Greek translation of the Old Testament) has “on the top of his staff” instead, which is quoted in [Hebrews 11:21](../../heb/11/21.md). You could include some of that information in a footnote. The difference between versions may be due to the fact that the Hebrew words for **bed** and “staff” are very similar in spelling. Or it could be that Jacob did both; for example, he may have been sitting at the head of his bed and leaning on his staff when he bowed his head and worshiped God. Alternate translation: [as he sat at the top of his bed] or [as he was lying on his bed]
48:1	krun		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	וַ⁠יְהִ֗י אַחֲרֵי֙ הַ⁠דְּבָרִ֣ים הָ⁠אֵ֔לֶּה	1	Consider again how you translated these two phrases in the book of Genesis. See [22:1](../22/01.md), [20](../22/20.md); [39:7](../39/07.md); [40:1](../40/01.md); [48:1](../48/01.md).

48:2	ppae		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	וַ⁠יַּגֵּ֣ד לְ⁠יַעֲקֹ֔ב וַ⁠יֹּ֕אמֶר הִנֵּ֛ה בִּנְ⁠ךָ֥ יוֹסֵ֖ף בָּ֣א אֵלֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1	Consider whether it is better in your language to use a direct or indirect quote here.
48:2	k2py		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠יִּתְחַזֵּק֙ יִשְׂרָאֵ֔ל	1	Consider whether you language has a similar idiom that fits well here. Also, make sure it is clear in your translation or in a footnote that **Israel** ([verses 2](../48/02.md), [8](../48/08.md), [11](../48/11.md), [13-14](../48/13.md), [21](../48/21.md)) and **Jacob** ([verses 2-3](../48/02.md)) refer to the same person, not two different people. Alternate translation: [Then Israel rallied his strength] or [Immediately Israel, who was lying down, used all his strength]
48:2	d201		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יֵּ֖שֶׁב עַל־הַ⁠מִּטָּֽה	1	The context ([verse 12](../48/12.md)) shows that Jacob sat on the edge of his bed with his feet resting on the floor and his knees facing Joseph’s sons. Also, for some languages it may be necessary (for politeness) to make it explicit that they greeted each other first before continuing their conversation. Alternate translation: [and sat up on the edge of his bed and they greeted each other]
48:3	owhk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר יַעֲקֹב֙ אֶל־יוֹסֵ֔ף	1	Alternate translation: [Then Jacob recounted to Joseph the following:]
48:3	t30j			נִרְאָֽה־אֵלַ֥⁠י	1	Consider again how you translated “appear” in the book of Genesis. See [8:5](../08/05.md); [12:7](../12/07.md); [17:1](../17/01.md); [18:1](../18/01.md); [26:2](../26/02.md), [24](../26/24.md); [35:1](../35/01.md), [9](../35/09.md); [46:29](../46/29.md); [48:3](../48/03.md). It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context. Alternate translation: [came to me in a vision long ago]
48:3	epp0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	בְּ⁠ל֖וּז בְּ⁠אֶ֣רֶץ כְּנָ֑עַן	1	For some languages it is more natural to put the larger place (Canaan) first before the smaller place (Luz) that is located inside it. It may also be more natural to put the time and place phrases first in this verse and say, “Long ago when I was at the town of Luz in the land/region of Canaan, God Almighty …” Also see how you spelled the name **Luz** in Genesis [28:19](../28/19.md) and [35:6](../35/06.md). Alternate translation: [when I was at the town of Luz in the land of Canaan] or [in the land of Canaan at the town of Luz]
48:3	yrw7			אֵ֥ל שַׁדַּ֛י	1	Consider again how you translated **God Almighty** in the book of Genesis. See [Gen 17:1](../17/01.md), [28:3](../28/03.md), [35:11](../35/11.md), and [43:14](../43/14.md). Alternate translation: [Almighty God]
48:3	ya75			וַ⁠יְבָ֖רֶךְ אֹתִֽ⁠י	1	For some languages it is more natural to begin a new sentence here. Do what is best in your language. Alternate translation: [He pronounced a blessing over me there]
48:4	byu6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר אֵלַ֗⁠י	1	The term **said** introduces a direct quotation. In your translation, use a natural way of introducing direct quotations in your language. It may not be necessary to represent this term explicitly. Make sure your translation of “blessed … and said” ([verses 3-4](../48/03.md)) refers to the same event, not two separate events. Alternate translation: [He said]
48:4	m1hy			הִנְ⁠נִ֤י מַפְרְ⁠ךָ֙ וְ⁠הִרְבִּיתִ֔⁠ךָ וּ⁠נְתַתִּ֖י⁠ךָ	1	See how you translated “make you fruitful and multiply you” in Genesis [28:3](../28/03.md) and “make him fruitful and … multiply him” in Genesis [17:20](../17/20.md). Alternate translation: [Look I will give you many descendants who will increase in number and become] or [Look I will give you and your descendants many children so that your descendants will become]
48:4	n300			לִ⁠קְהַ֣ל עַמִּ֑ים	1	See how you translated this phrase in Genesis [28:3](../28/03.md), and a similar phrase (“a community of nations”) in [35:11](../35/11.md). Alternate translation: [many ethnic groups]
48:5	gagv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וְ⁠עַתָּ֡ה שְׁנֵֽי־בָנֶי⁠ךָ֩	1	The phrase **And now** shows that there is a change of topic. Make sure it is clear in your translation that Jacob is no longer quoting God’s words in [verse 5](../48/05.md).
48:5	jujn			בְּ⁠אֶ֣רֶץ מִצְרַ֗יִם	1	Alternate translation: [here in the land of Egypt]

48:7	jw7i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וַ⁠אֲנִ֣י	1	Here the author is providing background information to help readers understand what happens next in the story. In your translation, introduce this information in a way that would be natural in your own language and culture. Jacob is probably explaining in that since his favorite wife Rachel died with only two sons, that is why he is treating her son Joseph’s two sons as his own sons ([verses 5-6](../48/05.md)). Alternate translation: [I want it this way because]
48:7	awjb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בְּ⁠בֹאִ֣⁠י	1	Jacob is in focus here, but he was traveling with his family, not alone. Decide whether or not it is necessary to make that explicit in your translation. Alternate translation: [as I and our family were coming home] or [as our family was coming home]
48:7	gfi4			מִ⁠פַּדָּ֗ן	1	Consider again how you translated “the land/region of Paddan Aram” in the book of Genesis. See [25:20](../25/20.md) (and note); [28:2](../28/02.md), [5-7](../28/05.md); [31:18](../31/18.md); [33:18](../33/18.md); [35:9](../35/09.md), [26](../35/26.md); [46:15](../46/15.md); [48:7](../48/07.md). Also, be consistent with how you spelled “Aram” in those verses and in Genesis [10:22–23](../10/22.md); [22:21](../22/21.md); [24:10](../24/10.md). Alternate translation: [from the land of Paddan Aram]
48:7	hucm			רָחֵ֜ל	1	Alternate translation: [my beloved wife Rachel]
48:7	ykrl			מֵ֩תָה֩ עָלַ֨⁠י	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here because the preposition can have different meanings. It could mean: (1) **died beside me** or “died by my side”; or (2) “died, bringing sorrow/grief on/to me”
48:7	oocn			בַּ⁠דֶּ֔רֶךְ בְּ⁠ע֥וֹד כִּבְרַת־אֶ֖רֶץ לָ⁠בֹ֣א אֶפְרָ֑תָה	1	Be consistent here with how you spelled **Ephrath** in Genesis [35:16](../35/16.md), [19](../35/19.md), and how you spelled **Bethlehem** in [35:19](../35/19.md).
48:7	p9yz			הִ֖וא בֵּ֥ית לָֽחֶם	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. This phrase might be: (1) Jacob’s words; or (2) the author’s words. If you follow the second interpretation, you could put this phrase within parentheses, outside of the quote marks.
48:8	yv08			וַ⁠יֹּ֖אמֶר	1	Alternate translation: [and asked Joseph]
48:8	wri5			מִי־אֵֽלֶּה	1	Joseph’s two sons were in their 20s at this time, so refer to them here with a term that fits with that fact. They were born before the famine started (Genesis [41:50–52](../41/50.md)), and Jacob had now been in Egypt for 17 years ([47:28](../47/28.md)). Alternate translation: [Whose sons are these?]
48:9	pmfc			וַ⁠יֹּ֤אמֶר יוֹסֵף֙ אֶל־אָבִ֔י⁠ו	1	Alternate translation: [Joseph said to him] or [Joseph replied]
48:9	ycj4			בָּנַ֣⁠י הֵ֔ם אֲשֶׁר־נָֽתַן־לִ֥⁠י אֱלֹהִ֖ים	1	Alternate translation: [They are my sons whom God gave to me]

48:9	tbew		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youdual	קָֽחֶ⁠ם־נָ֥א אֵלַ֖⁠י	1	Some languages have a dual pronoun that works well to refer to Joseph’s two sons here (and throughout [chapter 48](../48/01.md)).
48:9	tqwb			וַ⁠אֲבָרֲכֵֽ⁠ם	1	Alternate translation: [so that I can ask God to prosper them]
48:10	w5i2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	וְ⁠עֵינֵ֤י יִשְׂרָאֵל֙ כָּבְד֣וּ	1	Consider whether or not it is natural in your language to use a conjunction (**Now**) to begin this clause that gives background information about Israel. Also, the word **heavy** is used here as an idiom that means Israel’s eyesight was getting bad, but he could still see some (as indicated in [verses 8](../48/08.md) and [11](../48/11.md)). Many languages have a similar idiom. A translation of [verse 10](../48/10.md) should not imply that Israel was completely blind. Alternate translation: [Israel had very bad eyesight]
48:10	nhh8			מִ⁠זֹּ֔קֶן	1	Alternate translation: [because he was very old]
48:10	igr4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	לֹ֥א יוּכַ֖ל לִ⁠רְא֑וֹת	1	For some languages it is more natural to switch the order of the clauses in this sentence and say, “Now Israel was very old, so his eyesight was failing and he was not able to see very well.” Alternate translation: [so that he could not see very well]
48:10	m3l9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יַּגֵּ֤שׁ אֹתָ⁠ם֙ אֵלָ֔י⁠ו	1	Make sure it is clear in your translation whom is being referred to at each point in this sentence. Alternate translation: [So Joseph brought his sons near to his father] or [So he had his sons stand near to his father]
48:10	xi1y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וַ⁠יִּשַּׁ֥ק לָ⁠הֶ֖ם	1	It may be helpful to read this sentence aloud in your translation to make sure the use of nouns and pronouns is natural and accurate in your language. Alternate translation: [and Israel kissed them on the cheeks] or [and his father kissed …]
48:10	yxhu			וַ⁠יְחַבֵּ֥ק לָ⁠הֶֽם	1	Consider again how you translated the word **embraced** in the book of Genesis. See [29:13](../29/13.md); [33:4](../33/04.md); [48:10](../48/10.md). Also compare that to how you translated an idiom (“fell on … neck”) that has a similar meaning in Genesis [33:4](../33/04.md); [45:14](../45/14.md), [46:29](../46/29.md). It may be necessary to translate these terms in different ways, depending on the context.
48:11	joqe			רְאֹ֥ה פָנֶ֖י⁠ךָ לֹ֣א פִלָּ֑לְתִּי	1	Alternate translation: [I did not think I would ever see you again]

48:11	w75i			הֶרְאָ֥ה אֹתִ֛⁠י אֱלֹהִ֖ים גַּ֥ם אֶת־זַרְעֶֽ⁠ךָ	1	Alternate translation: [God has allowed me to see even your offspring] or [God has also allowed me to see your offspring]
48:12	wvkp			וַ⁠יּוֹצֵ֥א יוֹסֵ֛ף אֹתָ֖⁠ם	1	Alternate translation: [Then Joseph took his sons away] or [Then Joseph had his sons step away]
48:12	agib		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	מֵ⁠עִ֣ם בִּרְכָּ֑י⁠ו	1	Joseph’s sons (who were in their 20s) were near Israel’s knees, so that he could hug them; they were not sitting on his knees or lap. Also make sure your translation of **his** refers to Joseph’s father (Israel/Jacob), not Joseph. Alternate translation: [from near his father]
48:12	kz74			וַ⁠יִּשְׁתַּ֥חוּ	1	Alternate translation: [and he prostrated himself before him]
48:12	jfto		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	לְ⁠אַפָּ֖י⁠ו אָֽרְצָ⁠ה	1	Joseph bowed to the ground to show thankfulness and respect to his father and possibly also to God. If necessary, you could make that information explicit in your translation or put it in a footnote. Alternate translation: [with his face toward the ground in thankfulness and respect]
48:13	ixv8			וַ⁠יִּקַּ֣ח יוֹסֵף֮	1	Alternate translation: [Then he took]
48:13	wvf8			אֶת־שְׁנֵי⁠הֶם֒	1	Alternate translation: [both of his sons]

48:13	o7vq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	וַ⁠יַּגֵּ֖שׁ אֵלָֽי⁠ו	1	For some languages it may be clearer or more natural to put this clause first in this verse and say, “Then he took/brought his sons close to his father again. He had Ephraim stand in front of Israel’s left hand/side, and he had Manasseh stand in front of Israel’s right hand/side.” Alternate translation: [and he took them close to his father again]
48:14	vklj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	וְ⁠אֶת־שְׂמֹאל֖⁠וֹ עַל־רֹ֣אשׁ מְנַשֶּׁ֑ה שִׂכֵּל֙ אֶת־יָדָ֔י⁠ו	1	In the Hebrew culture, the right side was the place of highest honor and using the right hand to bless someone was symbolic of giving greater honor to that person. The oldest son was also the one who normally received the greater blessing. Israel reverses that here and gives Joseph’s younger son the greater blessing. It may be important to include a footnote in your translation that gives this information.
48:14	jxo4			כִּ֥י	1	Make sure that the way you translate **because** fits with the fact that Israel wanted to place his right hand on Ephraim (to give him the greater blessing), even though Manasseh was the firstborn (who would normally receive the greater blessing in that culture). Alternate translation: [in spite of the fact that]
48:15	llyx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠יְבָ֥רֶךְ אֶת־יוֹסֵ֖ף וַ⁠יֹּאמַ֑ר	1	By **he blessed Joseph**, the author means Israel blessed Joseph by blessing Joseph’s sons ([verses 15-16](../48/15.md), [19-20](../48/19.md)). You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [Then Israel blessed Joseph by blessing his sons and saying]
48:15	gsdn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-blessing	הָֽ⁠אֱלֹהִ֡ים	1	Jacob is asking God to bless the his son Joseph. In your translation, use a form that people would recognize as a blessing in your language. You might express this as a prayer if that would be more natural in your language. Consider whether or not it is better in your language to break up the long sentence in [verses 15-16](../48/15.md) into shorter sentences. Alternate translation: [May God bless your sons, the God] or [I ask God to bless your sons. He is the God]
48:15	iwxf			אֲשֶׁר֩ & אֲבֹתַ֤⁠י & אַבְרָהָ֣ם וְ⁠יִצְחָ֔ק	1	Alternate translation: [whom my forefathers Abraham and Isaac]
48:15	r8jy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	הִתְהַלְּכ֨וּ & לְ⁠פָנָי⁠ו֙	1	See how you translated the idiom “walk/live before” in Genesis [17:1](../17/01.md) and [24:40](../24/40.md). You may need to translate it differently in different contexts. Alternate translation: [walked with according to his will] or [lived obediently in the presence of] or [obeyed]
48:15	bi81		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הָֽ⁠אֱלֹהִים֙ הָ⁠רֹעֶ֣ה אֹתִ֔⁠י	1	The word **shepherding** includes guiding, protecting, and providing food and water, such as a shepherd would do for his sheep. Here it is used as a image that refers to God’s complete care of Israel throughout his life. Consider whether or not it is best in your language to use a similar image here. Alternate translation: [the same God who has watched over me]
48:15	dt5m			מֵ⁠עוֹדִ֖⁠י עַד־הַ⁠יּ֥וֹם הַ⁠זֶּֽה	1	Alternate translation: [from the beginning of my life until the present day]
48:16	hkqg			יְבָרֵךְ֮ אֶת־הַ⁠נְּעָרִים֒	1	Since Joseph’s sons were probably in their 20s, make sure your translation of this phrase does not sound like they were little **boys**. The Hebrew word for “boy” here can also be translated as “lad,” “servant,” or “young man,” depending on the context and who is speaking to whom. With that in mind, consider again how you translated this word in the book of Genesis. See [14:24](../14/24.md); [18:7](../18/07.md); [19:4](../19/04.md); [21:12](../21/12.md), [17-20](../21/17.md); [22:3](../22/03.md), [5](../22/05.md), [12](../22/12.md), [19](../22/19.md); [25:27](../25/27.md); [34:19](../34/19.md); [37:2](../37/02.md); [41:12](../41/12.md); [43:8](../43/08.md); [44:22](../44/22.md), [30-34](../44/30.md); [48:16](../48/16.md).

Alternate translation: [In fact, the descendants of your firstborn son will also become a ethnic group, and he will be a great man] or [In fact, your firstborn son will also be a important man, and he will be the ancestor of a people group]
48:19	d8w8			וְ⁠אוּלָ֗ם אָחִ֤י⁠ו הַ⁠קָּטֹן֙ יִגְדַּ֣ל מִמֶּ֔⁠נּוּ	1	Alternate translation: [However, his younger brother Ephraim will be even greater than he will be]

48:21	yses		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	וְ⁠הָיָ֤ה אֱלֹהִים֙ עִמָּ⁠כֶ֔ם	1	The pronouns **you** and **your** are plural throughout this verse and probably refer to all Israel’s family, including Joseph, his brothers, and their descendants. Alternate translation: [but God will always stay with all of you and help you] or [but God will always stay with you and your brothers and all your descendants and help you]
48:21	ydkc			וְ⁠הֵשִׁ֣יב אֶתְ⁠כֶ֔ם	1	Alternate translation: [He will also bring you back]

48:22	xrzo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	וַ⁠אֲנִ֞י נָתַ֧תִּֽי לְ⁠ךָ֛	1	The pronouns **you** and **your** shift to singular in [verse 22](../48/22.md), so use the singular form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.. Alternate translation: [And I bequeath to you as part of your inheritance]
48:22	cazk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	שְׁכֶ֥ם	1	Here, **Schechem** could refer to: (1) the city of Shechem. (2) a mountain ridge. This second interpretation comes from the meaning of the Hebrew word “shekem” (“shoulder”), which can be used as an image to refer to a mountain slope or ridge.
48:22	peu5			אַחַ֖ד עַל־אַחֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1	Alternate translation: [which is more land than I am giving to your brothers and]

This is more land than I am giving to your brothers.” Also consider again how you translated **Amorites** in the book of Genesis. See [10:16](../10/16.md); [14:7](../14/07.md), [13](../14/13.md); [15:16](../15/16.md), [21](../15/21.md); [48:22](../48/22.md). Alternate translation: [the Amorites in battle using my sword and my bow]
49:1	i8ic			וַ⁠יִּקְרָ֥א יַעֲקֹ֖ב אֶל־בָּנָ֑י⁠ו	1	The events in [chapter 49](../49/01.md) may have occurred on the same day as the events in [chapter 48](../48/01.md), or not very long after that. Consider again how you translated **called for** in the book of Genesis. See [12:18](../12/18.md); [14:14](../14/14.md); [20:2](../20/02.md), [8-9](../20/08.md); [24:57–58](../24/57.md); [26:9](../26/09.md); [27:1](../27/01.md), [42](../27/42.md); [28:1](../28/01.md); [31:4](../31/04.md); [39:14](../39/14.md); [41:8](../41/08.md), [14](../41/14.md); [46:33](../46/33.md); [47:29](../47/29.md); [49:1](../49/01.md).
49:1	l6m5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	הֵאָֽסְפוּ֙	1	Much of what Jacob says to his sons in [verses 1-27](../49/01.md) is Hebrew poetry, which is characterized by the use of parallelisms and metaphors to emphasize important points. Many translations put these verses in poetry format (starting here); many others use regular paragraph formatting. For a complete list of verses that some translations treat as poetry in the book of Genesis, see the introduction to the book. Alternate translation: [Gather yourselves together before me]
49:1	upew			וְ⁠אַגִּ֣ידָה לָ⁠כֶ֔ם	1	Alternate translation: [and I will declare to you] or [so that I can inform you]
49:1	gmu9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֵ֛ת אֲשֶׁר־יִקְרָ֥א אֶתְ⁠כֶ֖ם	1	Much of what Jacob prophesies in this chapter about his sons also applies to their descendants. Some translation teams may prefer to put that information in a footnote rather than make it explicit in the text. Also see how you translated **meet** in Genesis [42:4](../42/04.md), [38](../42/38.md).
49:1	xg3p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	בְּ⁠אַחֲרִ֥ית הַ⁠יָּמִֽים	1	In this context, this phrase refers to a period of years in the future. Consider what is the best way to communicate that in your language. Alternate translation: [in the days ahead] or [in future days]
49:2	j5co		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	הִקָּבְצ֥וּ וְ⁠שִׁמְע֖וּ בְּנֵ֣י יַעֲקֹ֑ב	1	Make sure it is clear in your translation of this verse that Jacob is talking to his own sons and is referring to himself as both Jacob and as Israel. Also, for some languages it is more natural to put the address **sons of Jacob** first in [verse 2](../49/02.md), or even first in the quote (which begins in [verse 1](../49/01.md)).
49:2	xh8b			וְ⁠שִׁמְע֖וּ אֶל־יִשְׂרָאֵ֥ל אֲבִי⁠כֶֽם	1	This clause forms a parallelism with the previous clause to emphasize that Jacob wants his sons to listen to him carefully. Try to keep both halves of this parallelism in your translation, since each half has a slightly different focus. Alternate translation: [Pay attention to me, your father Israel]
49:3	tmwk			רְאוּבֵן֙ בְּכֹ֣רִ⁠י אַ֔תָּה	1	Consider again how you translated **firstborn** in the book of Genesis. See [4:4](../04/04.md); [10:15](../10/15.md); [19:31](../19/31.md), [33-34](../19/33.md), [37](../19/37.md); [22:21](../22/21.md); [25:13](../25/13.md), [27](../25/27.md); [27:19](../27/19.md), [32](../27/32.md); [29:26](../29/26.md); [35:23](../35/23.md); [36:15](../36/15.md); [38:6–7](../38/06.md); [41:51](../41/51.md); [43:33](../43/33.md); [46:8](../46/08.md), [14](../46/14.md); [48:18](../48/18.md); [49:3](../49/03.md). It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context.
49:3	wp60		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	כֹּחִ֖⁠י וְ⁠רֵאשִׁ֣ית אוֹנִ֑⁠י	1	This phrase is used here as a euphemistic idiom that refers to Jacob’s ability to have children. Other languages may have a similar idiom. Translate this in a way that will not embarrass or offend listeners. Alternate translation: [the result of my fertility, and the first child I had as a young man] or [You are the first sign of my manhood and strength]
49:3	zu3n			יֶ֥תֶר שְׂאֵ֖ת וְ⁠יֶ֥תֶר עָֽז	1	Alternate translation: [You had higher honor and authority than all your brothers]
49:4	ngg3			פַּ֤חַז	1	Alternate translation: [However, you are uncontrollable] or [However, you are reckless]
49:4	m3c3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כַּ⁠מַּ֨יִם֙	1	Here Jacob compares Reuben’s reckless, uncontrolled sexual behavior to turbulent water that is out of control and destructive. Consider whether or not you have a similar comparison in your language that would fit well here. Alternate translation: [like a flood of water]
49:4	ht6q			אַל־תּוֹתַ֔ר	1	Alternate translation: [so you will no longer have your high position in our family] or [so you will no longer be first among your brothers]
49:4	s4lx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	כִּ֥י עָלִ֖יתָ מִשְׁכְּבֵ֣י אָבִ֑י⁠ךָ אָ֥ז חִלַּ֖לְתָּ	1	This clause, along with the rest of the verse, is a euphemistic way of referring to Reuben committing adultery by sleeping with his father’s concubine (secondary wife) Bilhah (Genesis [35:22](../35/22.md)). Alternate translation: [because you got into my bed with my wife and dishonored me!] or [because you dishonored me by getting into my bed and committing adultery with my concubine]
49:4	u62z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	יְצוּעִ֥⁠י עָלָֽה	1	Here Jacob repeats part of what he said in the previous clause, in order to emphasize Reuben’s sin against him and to communicate how upset he is about it. He may have still been talking to Reuben (switching from second to third person), or he may have been exclaiming about Reuben to himself and the rest of his sons.
49:5	jadm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	שִׁמְע֥וֹן וְ⁠לֵוִ֖י	1	In [verses 3-27](../49/03.md), Jacob sometimes refers to his sons using second person (“you”), and sometimes (as here) he uses third person (“they” or “he”). Consider whether or not it is better in your language to use second person throughout these verses, especially since Jacob is talking to his sons who are right there with him. Also, some languages have dual pronouns that fit well in [verses 5-7](../49/05.md). Alternate translation: [As for Simeon and Levi, they]
49:5	lnz6			אַחִ֑ים	1	This phrase is used here as an idiom that emphasizes the fact that Simeon and Levi thought alike and acted together to do evil things. Alternate translation: [are close brothers] or [are partners in crime] or [do evil things together]
49:5	hpdj			כְּלֵ֥י חָמָ֖ס מְכֵרֹתֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	Make sure in your translation that the pronouns you use here (and in [verses 6-7](../49/06.md)) fit with the way you translated the beginning of this verse. Alternate translation: [They use their weapons to do violent things together]
49:6	sbst		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	אַל־תָּבֹ֣א נַפְשִׁ֔⁠י	1	Here Jacob uses the phrase **my soul** to refer to himself and to emphasize how strongly he feels about what he is saying. Consider what is the best way to communicate that in your language. Alternate translation: [Do not ever let me] or [May I never]
49:6	h9hm			בְּ⁠סֹדָ⁠ם֙ אַל־תָּבֹ֣א	1	In [verses 5-7](../49/05.md), Jacob is probably referring to the time when Simeon and Levi killed all the males in the city of Shechem out of revenge (Genesis [34:25–26](../34/25.md), [30](../34/30.md)). Jacob was very upset that they did that. Alternate translation: [take part in their evil plans] or [participate with them when you plan evil things!]
49:6	z996		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	בִּ⁠קְהָלָ֖⁠ם אַל־תֵּחַ֣ד כְּבֹדִ֑⁠י	1	This clause forms a parallelism with the previous clause and emphasizes that Jacob is upset and does not want to participate with these two sons in their evil behavior. Consider what is the best way to translate that in your language. Alternate translation: [Do not let my honor be associated with your evil plans] or [I never want to be linked with their evil plans]
49:6	ckzx			כִּ֤י בְ⁠אַפָּ⁠ם֙ הָ֣רְגוּ אִ֔ישׁ	1	The phrase **a man** probably refers collectively here to all the men whom these two sons killed in the city of Shechem (Genesis [34:25–26](../34/25.md), [30](../34/30.md)). Alternate translation: [because you became angry and murdered many men]
49:6	z1y0			וּ⁠בִ⁠רְצֹנָ֖⁠ם עִקְּרוּ־שֽׁוֹר	1	This may have happened during the time that Simeon and Levi took revenge on the people of Shechem. Alternate translation: [and just to please yourselves, you crippled some oxen so they could not walk] or [and you cut the leg tendons of some oxen just for the fun of it]
49:7	cb28		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	אָר֤וּר אַפָּ⁠ם֙ כִּ֣י עָ֔ז וְ⁠עֶבְרָתָ֖⁠ם כִּ֣י קָשָׁ֑תָה	1	Consider what is the best way to translate this parallelism in your language. Also, consider again how you translated “cursed” in the book of Genesis. See [3:14](../03/14.md) (and note), 17; [4:11](../04/11.md); [5:29](../05/29.md); [8:21](../08/21.md); [9:25](../09/25.md); [12:3](../12/03.md); [27:12–13](../27/12.md), [29](../27/29.md); [49:7](../49/07.md). Alternate translation: [May God curse them for your intense anger and your malicious fury!] or [I ask God to punish them for being so intensely angry and malicious!]
49:7	ykq9			אֲחַלְּקֵ֣⁠ם	1	The last half of [verse 7](../49/07.md) specifies how Jacob is asking God to curse Simeon and Levi. Alternate translation: [I ask God to disperse them and their descendants] or [May he cause them and their descendants to be spread out]
49:7	f5mw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠יַעֲקֹ֔ב	1	In this context, the name **Jacob** refers to his family and especially his descendants. Alternate translation: [among the family of Jacob]
49:7	b95x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	וַ⁠אֲפִיצֵ֖⁠ם	1	The clauses “I will divide …” and “I will scatter …” form a parallelism that emphasizes the way Jacob is asking God to curse Simeon and Levi. If possible, it is best to keep both parts of a parallelism in your translation. Alternate translation: [Yes, I will]
49:7	e9qw			וַ⁠אֲפִיצֵ֖⁠ם	1	Consider again how you translated **scatter** in the book of Genesis. See [10:18](../10/18.md), [32](../10/32.md); [11:4](../11/04.md), [8-9](../11/08.md); [49:7](../49/07.md). It may be necessary to translate this term in different ways, depending on the context. If the pronoun “you” is used here in your translation, it should be plural. Alternate translation: [disperse you] or [cause them to be spread out]
49:7	ih68			בְּ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	Jacob’s prophecy in [verse 7](../49/07.md) came true many years later: the tribe of Simeon was absorbed by the tribe of Judah ([Joshua 19:1](../../jos/19/01.md)), and the tribe of Levi never had its own territory, but rather lived in cities scattered throughout the other tribes of Israel ([Joshua 21:1–42](../../jos/21/01.md)). You could put this information in a footnote. Alternate translation: [throughout the descendants of Israel]
49:8	mfza			יְהוּדָ֗ה אַתָּה֙ יוֹד֣וּ⁠ךָ אַחֶ֔י⁠ךָ	1	In the Hebrew text, the pronoun **you** is emphatic, and it has an emphatic position in the sentence. Consider what is the best way to communicate that emphasis in your language.

49:8	lhkv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	יָדְ⁠ךָ֖ בְּ⁠עֹ֣רֶף	1	Consider what is the best way to translate this Hebrew idiom in your language.

For some languages it is better to use second person references (“you, your”) throughout [verses 8-12](../49/08.md). Alternate translation: [You are like a lion that stretches out and lies down to rest after eating]
49:9	tf30		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וּ⁠כְ⁠לָבִ֖יא מִ֥י יְקִימֶֽ⁠נּוּ	1	This sentence forms a parallelism with the previous sentence to emphasize Judah’s authority. Also, Jacob uses a rhetorical question here to emphasize the respect that people will have for Judah. Some languages must use a statement here instead. Alternate translation: [Yes, you are like a lion that no one dares to awaken] or [No one dares to disrespect that lion]

49:10	f9a1			עַ֚ד כִּֽי־יָבֹ֣א שִׁיל֔וֹ	1	Jacob is probably prophesying here about the coming of the Messiah/Christ. This fits with the fact that Jesus was a descendant of the tribe of Judah and is now ruling as the true King over heaven and earth. You could put some of that information in a footnote. Alternate translation: [until the highest king arrives] or [until the One whom the scepter belongs to comes]
49:10	jg91			וְ⁠ל֖⁠וֹ יִקְּהַ֥ת עַמִּֽים	1	Alternate translation: [and the nations of the earth obey him] or [and all people obey him] or [All people will obey him]

To make that clear, you could make that explicit here and then use plural pronouns “they” and “their” throughout the verse. Or if you are using the second person throughout this section, you could say, “You and your descendants …” and use plural pronouns “you” and “your” after that. Alternate translation: [Judah and his descendants]

Alternate translation: [He will be so rich that he will tie his donkey to his grapevines and let it eat the valuable fruit]

The phrase **blood of grapes** is an idiom that refers to red wine made from the juice of grapes. Alternate translation: [They will still have so much wine from other vines that you could even use the wine like water to wash your robes and other clothes]

49:12	cm3s			חַכְלִילִ֥י & מִ⁠יָּ֑יִן	1	The Hebrew text is ambiguous here. It could mean: (1) “will be bright from drinking abundant wine,” or (2) “will be darker than wine,” In both interpretations the emphasis is that Judah’s descendants will be blessed with an abundance of the best foods, including wine and milk, which are examples of the most valuable foods that were produced in the land.

It may be necessary to translate these terms in different ways, depending on the context. Alternate translation: [and their sheep and cattle]
50:8	redu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	עָזְב֖וּ	1	The children and animals were probably left with servants who took care of them during the funeral. For some languages it may be better to change the order of the phrases in this sentence and say, “They left behind only their children and their livestock in Goshen Province.” Alternate translation: [they left behind] or [were left behind with servants]

It was most likely on the west side of the Jordan River, since that is where the cave was located and that is where the Canaanites would have been most likely to observe Joseph’s family and the Egyptians mourning ([verse 11](../50/11.md)). However, since its location is not certain, it is best to translate **beyond the Jordan** in a general way (like the Hebrew text is). Alternate translation: [which was located across the Jordan River]

50:21	qnh9			אָנֹכִ֛י אֲכַלְכֵּ֥ל אֶתְ⁠כֶ֖ם וְ⁠אֶֽת־טַפְּ⁠כֶ֑ם	1	In the Hebrew text here, **I** is an emphatic pronoun. Consider what is the best way to translate that in your language.
