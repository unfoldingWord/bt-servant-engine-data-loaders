The outline above offers one possible way of outlining this book.\n\n### What is the Song of Songs about?\n\nThe Song of Songs is a poem or a series of poems that celebrate love and intimacy between a man and a woman. Jews traditionally have interpreted the book as a picture of God’s love for his people Israel. Until the 1800’s the main view among Christians was that this book is primarily a picture of the love between Christ and his bride, the Church. Since the 1800’s the more common view has been that it is a poem or a series of poems that give a beautiful picture of love between a man and a woman. Many Christians also think that, even though the main meaning of this poem is to give a beautiful portrayal of romantic love between a man and a woman, this book also contains lessons about God’s love for his bride, the Church.\n\n### Who wrote the Song of Songs?\n\nThe first verse of the book (“The Song of Songs, which is of Solomon”) gives the idea that King Solomon of Israel wrote it. However, there are several possible ways to interpret the meaning of this title. A translation note for this verse discusses the possible meanings.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nThis book is traditionally titled “Song of Songs,” which means the very best song, or “Song of Solomon.” It may also be called “Songs of Love,” “Great Poems of Love,” or “The Love Songs of Solomon.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What place do the descriptions of sexual behavior have in the Song of Songs?\n\nThe Song of Songs approves of sexual behavior which expresses love between a husband and his wife.\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### How many characters are in the Song of Songs?\n\nThe two main characters in this book are the man and the woman, two people who love each other. In [8:8–9](../08/08.md) the woman’s brothers speak among themselves. In different places throughout the book, a group of women called the “daughters of Jerusalem” speak or are spoken to. However, it is possible that the group of women is not real but imagined. They may have been written into the poem for poetic effect.\n\nSome interpreters believe there may be more characters than these, but this is not certain. The ULT and UST versions recognize only the man, the woman, the group of women (and possibly a group of friends in some parts), and the woman’s brothers.\n\n### What are the lines in the UST about people speaking?\n\nThe Song of Songs is a poem that shows the words and thoughts of a man, a woman, the woman’s friends, and the woman’s brothers. Throughout the poem, the author does not identify the speakers and their audience. To help readers understand the poem, some translations attempt to identify the speaker and the audience. Since it is not always certain who is speaking, translations sometimes disagree about the identity of the speaker.\n\nThe UST places a header before each speech to identify the speaker and the audience. For example: “The woman speaking to the women of Jerusalem,” “The woman speaking to the man,” “The man speaking to the woman,” or “The woman speaking to herself.” Translators are encouraged to include these ways of identifying the speaker and the audience. Be careful to format them differently from the scripture text. The translators should also include an initial note to their readers indicating that these explanations are not part of the scripture text.\n\nThere are different views among Bible scholars about who the man is―a shepherd boy or King Solomon. Some think that both speak at various times in this book and compete for the woman’s love. The headers in the UST indicate when a man is speaking or being spoken to, as in “The man speaking to the woman he loves” and “The woman speaking to the man she loves.” The headers do not indicate the identity of the man.\n\n### How should one translate the Song of Songs if the readers would view certain terms as coarse, vulgar, or improper?\n\nReaders might consider many images or forms in the Song of Songs as socially improper when translated. Whenever possible, the translator should try to avoid offensive language by using expressions that will not cause offense. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism]])\n\n### How do I translate metaphors and similes in this book?\n\nBecause the author uses images throughout this book to express things in a beautiful and captivating way, it is recommended that you maintain these images or select images from your culture and language that communicate the same concepts.\n\nThe many metaphors and similes in this book are used to add poetic beauty and emotional effect; however, their meaning is sometimes unclear. Sometimes the reader does not know whether a sexual meaning is intended. At times the wording carries both a literal and a sexual meaning. However, though meanings are often unclear, it is not always necessary to clarify the meaning; often ambiguity in translation is best. You could translate the words as they are written to avoid committing to a specific meaning. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Translating terms of endearment\n\nThe word which the ULT translates as “my beloved” occurs 26 times in this book. Each time it occurs the woman uses it to refer to the man she loves. You should translate this term consistently throughout this book. The word which the ULT translates as “my darling” appears nine times in this book. Each time it occurs the man uses it to refer to the woman he loves. Be sure to translate this term consistently throughout the book.
1:intro	xrm2				0	# Song of Songs 1 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Metaphors\n\nIn the ancient Near East, it was common to describe a woman by using metaphors involving animals. In many cultures today, such metaphors could be considered offensive. Cultures vary in the metaphors of beauty they use to describe women. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### The lines indicating who is speaking and who is being spoken to\n\nThroughout the poem, the author does not identify the speakers or their audience. To help readers understand the poem, some translations attempt to identify the speaker and the audience. It is not always certain who the speaker is, so sometimes translations disagree about the identity of the speaker. Before each speech, the UST places a header to identify the speaker and the audience. You may wish to do the same in your translation.\n\n### “I am black”\n\nIn the ancient Near East, wealthy people usually had lighter skin because they did not need to work outside, where the sun darkened their skin. Because this young woman had to work outside in the sun, her skin became dark. This is why she says “I am black” in [1:5–6](../01/05.md).

You may be able to use the same construction in your language to express the meaning here. Alternatively, your language may have another way of showing the emphasis. Alternate translation: [Let him kiss me again and again with the kisses of his mouth] or [Let him cover my face with the kisses of his mouth] or [I wish he would kiss me passionately with his mouth]
1:2	d9mu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	דֹּדֶ֖י⁠ךָ	1	In this book every occurrence of the words **you** and **your** is singular. Your language may require you to mark these forms.

Your language may have a way of indicating speech that is expressed toward a person who is not present to hear what is being said. If your language has a way to indicate that, you could use it here.
1:3	j5ka			לְ⁠רֵ֨יחַ֙	1	The Hebrew word which the ULT translates as **As for** could: (1) indicate reference, in which case it should be translated with an equivalent phrase or as the ULT translates it.

1:3	si36		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	שְׁמָנֶ֣י⁠ךָ טוֹבִ֔ים	1	Here, **oils** refers to colognes or perfumes. The author is assuming the reader knows that pleasant-smelling spices were mixed into olive oil in order to make a pleasant-smelling perfume, which was then applied to the skin.

1:3	pj62		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	עַל־כֵּ֖ן	1	The Hebrew words translated as **Therefore** indicate that what follows is a result of what came before.

1:4	ty2p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	נָּר֑וּצָה	1	The word **us** refers to the young woman and the man that she is addressing, so use the inclusive form of that word if your language marks that distinction. Alternate translation: [let you and me run]
1:4	xpoe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	נָּר֑וּצָה	1	Here the woman uses **run** as a poetic way of expressing her desire that she and the man she loves should quickly go away together.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [He whom I love is like a king to me and] or [He who is like a king to me]
1:4	ieqb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-declarative	הֱבִיאַ֨⁠נִי הַ⁠מֶּ֜לֶךְ	1	The original language word which the ULT translates as **The king has brought me** could be describing: (1) a request or wish that the woman has.

1:4	ku0t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	נָגִ֤ילָה וְ⁠נִשְׂמְחָה֙	1	The terms **be glad** and **rejoice** mean similar things. The author is using the two terms together for emphasis.

1:4	geq4			נַזְכִּ֤ירָה	1	Alternate translation: [Let us proclaim]

1:5	jpj9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	וְֽ⁠נָאוָ֔ה	1	Here the word **but** is introducing a contrast between what was expected and what follows.

The woman is comparing her skin to these tents. The phrase **the curtains of Solomon** refers to the beautiful curtains in Solomon’s palace. The point of the first comparison is that the woman’s skin was **black**. The second indicates that the woman was also **lovely**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use equivalent comparisons from your culture, or you could state that explicitly.

1:6	nqqb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	שֶׁ⁠אֲנִ֣י שְׁחַרְחֹ֔רֶת	1	Solomon assumes that his readers will understand that here, **I am black** means “my skin is black” or “my skin is very dark,” as it did in [1:5](../01/05.md). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could include this information. Alternate translation: [that my skin is black] or [that my skin is very dark]
1:6	im6w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	שֶׁ⁠שֱּׁזָפַ֖תְ⁠נִי הַ⁠שָּׁ֑מֶשׁ	1	The word **that** indicates that what follows is a reason for what came before. Use a connector in your language that makes it clear that what follows is a reason for what came before. Alternate translation: [because the sun scorched me]
1:6	thz7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	שֶׁ⁠שֱּׁזָפַ֖תְ⁠נִי הַ⁠שָּׁ֑מֶשׁ	1	The author assumes that his readers will understand that **the sun scorched me** means “the sun made my skin color turn very dark.” You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [that the sun darkened my skin]
1:6	v86f			נֹטֵרָ֣ה אֶת־הַ⁠כְּרָמִ֔ים כַּרְמִ֥⁠י שֶׁ⁠לִּ֖⁠י לֹ֥א נָטָֽרְתִּי	1	Alternate translation: [as caretaker of the vineyards— I have not taken care of my own vineyard]
1:6	w18k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	כַּרְמִ֥⁠י שֶׁ⁠לִּ֖⁠י לֹ֥א נָטָֽרְתִּי	1	The woman is probably using the phrase **my vineyard** to refer to her skin. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [my skin I have not protected from the sun] or [I have not protected my complexion from the sun]
1:7	f9hi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	שֶׁ֤⁠אָהֲבָה֙ נַפְשִׁ֔⁠י	1	The woman is using one part of herself, her **soul**, to represent all of her. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [you, the man whom I love]
1:7	mpbu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	אֵיכָ֣ה תִרְעֶ֔ה	1	The woman is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need to be complete. You could supply these words from the context if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: [where do you graze your flock] or [where do you graze your sheep]
1:7	v54w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	שַׁ⁠לָּ⁠מָ֤ה אֶֽהְיֶה֙ כְּ⁠עֹ֣טְיָ֔ה עַ֖ל עֶדְרֵ֥י חֲבֵרֶֽי⁠ךָ	1	Here the woman is not asking for information but is using the question form for emphasis. If you would not use a rhetorical question for this purpose in your language, you could translate her words as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: [I do not want to be like a woman who covers herself beside the flocks of your companions] or [Tell me so that I will not be like a woman who covers herself beside the flocks of your companions]
1:7	f5eb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	כְּ⁠עֹ֣טְיָ֔ה עַ֖ל עֶדְרֵ֥י חֲבֵרֶֽי⁠ךָ	1	The author assumes that his readers will understand that **covers herself** means “covers herself with a veil.” The phrase **your companions** refers to the other shepherds who pastured their animals near the flocks of the man; they were probably his friends. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [like a woman who covers herself with a veil beside the flocks of the other shepherds]
1:7	v6rs		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	שַׁ⁠לָּ⁠מָ֤ה אֶֽהְיֶה֙ כְּ⁠עֹ֣טְיָ֔ה עַ֖ל עֶדְרֵ֥י חֲבֵרֶֽי⁠ךָ	1	The woman does not want to look **like a woman who covers herself** because in her culture, prostitutes often covered their faces with a veil so that people would not recognize them. She did not want to be mistaken for a prostitute while attempting to find him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: [For why should I be like a prostitute who covers herself with a veil and wanders around among the flocks of your companions]
1:8	lc64		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	אִם־לֹ֤א תֵדְעִי֙ לָ֔⁠ךְ הַ⁠יָּפָ֖ה בַּ⁠נָּשִׁ֑ים צְֽאִי־לָ֞⁠ךְ	1	If it would help your readers to see that this is a conditional statement, you could supply a word like “then” in your translation. Alternate translation: [If you do not know, most beautiful among women, then go out]
1:8	fu4f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	אִם־לֹ֤א תֵדְעִי֙ לָ֔⁠ךְ הַ⁠יָּפָ֖ה בַּ⁠נָּשִׁ֑ים	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could begin this verse with the phrase **most beautiful among women**. Alternate translation: [Most beautiful among women, if you do not know]
1:8	sy7k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	צְֽאִי־לָ֞⁠ךְ	1	Your language may say “come” rather than **go** in contexts such as these. Use whichever is more natural. Alternate translation: [come out]

(2) the man saying that the beauty of the woman is like the beauty of one of Pharaoh’s mares. The horses of the king of Egypt, the Pharaoh, were known to be the best in the world and very beautiful. This is the second option because, normally, only stallions, not mares, pulled the chariots. Alternate translation: [Your beauty is like the beauty of Pharaoh’s chariot horses] or [I compare your beauty to the beauty of Pharaoh’s chariot horses]
1:9	zyj5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠רִכְבֵ֣י פַרְעֹ֔ה	1	Here, **the chariots** represents “the horses that pull the chariots.” Chariots were normally drawn by pairs of male horses (stallions).

2:intro	u8uv				0	# Song of Songs 2 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### The woman and man compliment each other by using metaphors and similes\n\nIn [2:1](../02/01.md) the woman uses a metaphor to tell the man she loves that she thinks she is common, like a flower that grows on the plains or a lily that grows in the valleys. The man responds in [2:2](../02/02.md) by using a simile to tell her how special she is when compared to other women. She then uses a simile in [2:3](../02/03.md) to tell him how special he is compared to other men. When translating these verses, pay close attention to the translation notes and the UST in order to understand the meaning.\n\n### Chiasm\n\nHebrew poetry sometimes uses a literary device called a “chiasm” (sometimes called “chiasmus”). A chiasm is when words or phrases are ordered in an AB-BA sequence. In [Song of Songs 2:14](../02/14.md) the author uses a chiasm. The ULT follows the Hebrew order and translates this verse as “show me your appearance, make me hear your voice, for your voice {is} sweet, and your appearance {is} lovely.” Notice that the phrases “your appearance” and “your voice” are repeated in an AB-BA sequence: “your appearance … your voice … your voice … your appearance.”

If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [I am as common as a wildflower of Sharon or a lily of the valleys] or [My beauty is as common as a wildflower of Sharon or a lily of the valleys]
2:1	ps9x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	חֲבַצֶּ֣לֶת	1	The original word which the ULT translates as **wildflower** refers to a specific type of flower which grows on the ground. The exact type of flower that the original word refers to cannot be known with certainty, so you could use the name of a pretty wildflower in your area, or you could use a more general term.
2:1	gh6w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֲנִי֙ חֲבַצֶּ֣לֶת הַ⁠שָּׁר֔וֹן	1	The writer assumes that the reader will know that **Sharon** was the name of a specific plain (a flat area) and that the word itself refers to a flat, wide area. Here the woman is probably referring to “plains” in general and expressing that she is like a wildflower that grows on the plains. You could include this information if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [I am a flower that grows on the plain of Sharon] or [I am a flower that grows on the plains]

The second phrase emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine the phrases into one. Alternate translation: [I am a wildflower that grows in the plains and the valleys]

If it would be helpful in your language, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: [As apple trees are more pleasant than other trees, so you, my beloved, are more pleasant than other men] or [As apple trees are more delightful than other trees, so you, my beloved, are more delightful than other men]

2:3	yr6x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	כְּ⁠תַפּ֨וּחַ֙	1	An **apple tree** is a tree that produces apples, a round, pleasant-tasting fruit. Bible scholars are not certain that the word the ULT translates as **apple** refers to what we now call an apple. It could refer to an apricot or another type of fruit.

The word **shadow** refers to the shade of the apple tree which gives protection from the sun. **I sat** represents being near or in the presence of the man. Here the woman speaks of her pleasurable feelings as if they were **his fruit** which is **sweet to my palate**. If it is possible in your language, you should try to retain the images used here or substitute a comparable image. However, if it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [He provides me with refreshment and protection when I am in his presence; he gives me great pleasure] or [I sit in his presence, and he refreshes and protects me. Like sweet fruit, he is delightful to me]

The phrase does not necessarily mean a house, so here it could be referring to the private location that the couple used as their meeting place, (described in [1:17](../01/17.md)). You could include this information if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [the place where wine is drunk] or [the place where wine is served] or [our meeting place]
2:4	hxuz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	בֵּ֣ית הַ⁠יָּ֔יִן	1	The woman is referring to a private meeting place, one in which they could enjoy expressing their love for each other.

In the author’s culture both raisins and **apples** were believed to give people strength for love. The second clause emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the clauses with a word that shows that the second clause is repeating the first one, not saying something additional, or you could combine these two clauses into one. Alternate translation: [Sustain me with raisin cakes; yes, refresh me with apples] or [strengthen me with fruit] or [strengthen me for love with fruit]
2:5	ukb7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	סַמְּכ֨וּ⁠נִי֙ & רַפְּד֖וּ⁠נִי	1	The phrases **Sustain me** and **refresh me** are plural imperative forms in the original language. The woman is addressing the man using plural forms to show the intensity of her feelings. The ULT indicates this intensity by placing an exclamation point at the end of this verse. Your language may allow you to use a plural form for this purpose, or you could use the singular form and show the intensity of emotion in another way.

(2) a request or wish that the woman has, and not something which has already happened. Alternate translation: [I hope he puts his left arm under my head and holds me close with his right arm] or [I want him to put his left arm under my head and hold me close with his right arm]

If your language would not use the possessive form for this, you could explain the meaning of the phrase **of the field** in your translation. Alternate translation: [by the wild female gazelles and does] or [by the wild female gazelles or the wild does] or [by the female gazelles or the does that live in the wild]
2:7	sz5c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	בִּ⁠צְבָא֔וֹת	1	A gazelle is a small type of antelope, that looks and moves like a deer and is similar in size.

The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word other than “and” in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: [gazing through the windows, yes, looking through the lattices]

(2) be used with singular meanings here, indicating the multiple openings of a single window and lattice. Alternate translation: [the window … the lattice]
2:9	s9xt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	הַֽ⁠חֲרַכִּֽים	1	The **lattices** are vertical and horizontal strips found inside a window frame. They have spaces between them through which a person could look. If your readers would not be familiar with lattices, you could use the name of something similar in your area, or you could use the wording of the UST. Alternate translation: [the screen]

2:11	asu3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ה⁠סתו עָבָ֑ר הַ⁠גֶּ֕שֶׁם חָלַ֖ף	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word other than “and” in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: [the winter has gone; yes, the rain has passed]
2:11	qxz4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	עָבָ֑ר	1	Your language might not say **has gone** in a context such as this. Alternate translation: [is finished] or [is over]

2:13	mk2y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	הַ⁠תְּאֵנָה֙ חָֽנְטָ֣ה פַגֶּ֔י⁠הָ	1	In this verse, the word **fig tree** is in singular form but refers to all the fig trees as a group.

He then tells her the way in which she is like a dove. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state this meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [O my one who is like a dove. You are like a gentle and timid dove which hides in the clefts of the rock and in the hiding places of the cliff] or [You are like a dove, like a gentle and shy dove which hides in the clefts of the rock and in the hiding places of the cliff] or [You are like a dove, far away in the clefts of the rock, in the hiding places of the cliff]

The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word such as “yes” in order to show that the second phrase is repeating a similar idea to the first one, not saying something additional. You could also combine the two lines as modeled by the UST. Alternate translation: [in the clefts of the rock, yes, in the hiding places of the cliff]

This is called a chiasm. Biblical Hebrew sometimes uses this literary device. If possible, try to follow this AB-BA sequence of presenting the information here. See the chapter introduction for more information regarding chiasms.
2:14	be0w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-imperative	הַרְאִ֨י⁠נִי֙ אֶתּ־מַרְאַ֔יִ⁠ךְ הַשְׁמִיעִ֖י⁠נִי	1	The phrases **show me** and **make me hear** are imperatives, but they communicate a polite request rather than a command. Use a form in your language that communicates a polite request. It may be helpful to add an expression such as “please” or “let” to make this clear. Alternate translation: [please let me see your appearance, please let me hear] or [let me see you, let me hear]

Catching **the foxes** represents removing or protecting against them. The **vineyards** represent the love the man and woman have for each other. The phrase **our vineyards {are in} blossom** means that their love is growing, like a plant blossoms and grows. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [Get rid of the harmful things that hinder and damage our relationship, for our relationship is blossoming] or [Remove the little things that threaten our growing relationship] or [There are other men who are like little foxes that ruin vineyards; do not allow those men to attack me]
2:15	dac9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	לָ֨⁠נוּ֙ שֽׁוּעָלִ֔ים שֽׁוּעָלִ֥ים קְטַנִּ֖ים	1	It is possible that the word that the ULT translates as **foxes** could, instead, refer to jackals.

2:15	ueuw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	לָ֨⁠נוּ֙ שֽׁוּעָלִ֔ים שֽׁוּעָלִ֥ים קְטַנִּ֖ים	1	Both **foxes** and jackals are land animals that are similar to small dogs and would ruin vineyards by digging up roots and eating the budding blossoms. If your readers would not be familiar with these animals and their habits, you could use the name of something similar in your area, or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: [the dog-like animals for us, the little dog-like animals]
2:15	v31m		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	לָ֨⁠נוּ֙ & וּ⁠כְרָמֵ֖י⁠נוּ	1	Here the words **us** and **our** refer to the woman and the man, so use the inclusive forms of these words if your language marks that distinction.

2:16	zb2r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	דּוֹדִ֥⁠י לִ⁠י֙ וַ⁠אֲנִ֣י ל֔⁠וֹ	1	The woman is speaking about the man in the third person even though she is most likely speaking directly to the man. This is common in Hebrew poetry. If this would not be natural in your language, you can translate this in a way that indicates that the woman is speaking directly to the man. Alternate translation: [My beloved, you belong to me, and I belong to you]
2:16	lxy4			הָ⁠רֹעֶ֖ה בַּ⁠שּׁוֹשַׁנִּֽים	1	The phrase **the man grazing among the lilies** could mean: (1) that the man himself is grazing among the lilies. (2) that the man grazes his flock of animals among the lilies. Alternate translation: [the man grazing his flock among the lilies]

She is using **lilies** to represent herself as she did in [2:1](../02/01.md). Here, **the lilies** probably represent the woman’s lips. The meaning here is that the man finds sustenance and enjoyment through being with the woman and kissing her lips. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [my beloved gets pleasure grazing among the lilies] or [my beloved gets pleasure as he grazes among the lilies]
2:16	x5db		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	בַּ⁠שּׁוֹשַׁנִּֽים	1	See how you translated “lily” (the singular form of **lilies**) in [2:1](../02/01.md).
2:17	p2uq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	שֶׁ⁠יָּפ֨וּחַ֙ הַ⁠יּ֔וֹם וְ⁠נָ֖סוּ הַ⁠צְּלָלִ֑ים	1	The phrases **the day breathes** and **the shadows flee** mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this type of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. Together, they both either refer to: (1) the evening time, when the evening breeze blows (**breathes**) and the shadows cast by the sun disappear (**flee**). Alternate translation: [the evening time when the breeze blows and the shadows cast by the sun disappear] or (2) the morning time, when the light from the sun dawns and the morning breeze blows (**breathes**). Alternate translation: [dawn tomorrow morning, when the darkness disappears]
2:17	h2b1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וְ⁠נָ֖סוּ הַ⁠צְּלָלִ֑ים	1	Here the author is leaving out the word **Until** that in many languages this sentence would need in order to be complete. You could supply this word from earlier in the sentence if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: [and until the shadows flee]
2:17	scgd			סֹב֩ דְּמֵה־לְ⁠ךָ֨ דוֹדִ֜⁠י	1	Alternate translation: [turn; my beloved, and be like]

2:17	iwlq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate	הָ֥רֵי בָֽתֶר	1	The word **Bether** is a word borrowed from the Hebrew that means “cleft” or “divided.” You will need to decide if you will borrow it into your language or if you will translate the meaning. Either approach has broad support. Here it could: (1) be a proper name that refers to a specific place in Israel. If you choose this option, then in your translation you could spell it the way that it sounds in your language and then put the meaning in a footnote. (2) be a description of **the mountains**. Alternate translation: [the cleft mountains] or [the rugged mountains] or [the mountain gorges]
3:intro	t72h				0	# Song of Songs 3 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Longing\n\nVerses [3:1–3](../03/01.md) describe the feeling of longing that the woman has for the man she loves, and it describes her diligently seeking him. Verse [3:4](../03/04.md) describes the woman finding the man she loves, holding onto him, and bringing him to her mother’s house.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Whether verses [3:1–4](../03/01.md) describe a dream, a real event, or something imagined\n\nBible scholars do not know for certain whether the events described in [3:1–4](../03/01.md) are real events or something that the woman dreamed or imagined. Many Bible scholars think that verses [3:1–4](../03/01.md) describe a dream. You may wish to explain this in a footnote, or you could indicate in a section header whether you think this is a dream, a real event, or something she imagined. You could also use a general section header such as “The woman searches for the man she loves and finds him,” which does not indicate whether this was a dream, a real event, or something imagined.
3:1	gagz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	עַל־מִשְׁכָּבִ⁠י֙ בַּ⁠לֵּיל֔וֹת	1	Because Bible scholars do not know if the events described in [3:1–4](../03/01.md) describe real events, dreams, or things imagined, you should not expand on or explain the phrase **On my bed in the night** in the text. However, you may wish to make reference to these possibilities in a header or footnote. See the section “Translation Issues in This Chapter” in the chapter introduction for more information.
3:1	eds0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-plural	בַּ⁠לֵּיל֔וֹת	1	In the original language, the phrase **in the night** uses a plural form of **night** and could mean that the woman: (1) sought the man during the night.

Hebrew poetry often uses repetition for emphasis. You may be able to use the same construction in your language to show the emphasis here. Alternatively, your language may have another way of showing the emphasis. Alternate translation: [I desperately sought him whom my soul loves] or [I earnestly sought him whom my soul loves]

4:intro	r3aw				0	# Song of Songs 4 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Beauty\n\nThe man describes the woman he loves as the epitome of beauty and attractiveness in [4:1–5](../04/01.md) and in [4:7](../04/07.md).\n\n### Feelings of longing to be with one’s lover who seems distant and temporarily inaccessible\n\nIn [4:8](../04/08.md) the man speaks of the woman he loves as if she were far away from him, and he invites her to “come with” him and “descend from” the height of three high places and be with him. The woman is not actually dwelling in these places, but rather the man is using imaginative and poetic language to describe how he feels about being separated from her and to describe his desire to be with her. In [4:12](../04/12.md) the man uses poetic language to describe the fact that the woman he loves is temporarily inaccessible.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### The garden metaphor\n\nIn this chapter, [4:12–5:1](../04/12.md) is an extended metaphor. This metaphor is a conversation between the man and the woman he loves in which he first compares her to “a locked garden” ([4:12–4:15](../04/12.md)) where many delightful things grow. She responds by inviting him to come to her garden in [4:16](../04/16.md). The man then responds to her invitation in [5:1](../05/01.md). The term “garden” is used as a metaphor for the woman in [4:12](../04/12.md), [4:16](../04/16.md) (two times), and [5:1](../05/01.md). You should be consistent in how you translate the term “garden.” In [4:13](../04/13.md), the man speaks of the woman’s body as “an orchard of pomegranate trees with delicious fruits,” and then in [4:16](../04/16.md) she invites the man to “come to his garden and eat its delicious fruit.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])\n\n### The “sister” metaphor\n\nThe phrase “my sister” is used in [4:9](../04/09.md), [4:10](../04/10.md), [4:12](../04/12.md), [5:1](../05/01.md), and [5:2](../05/02.md). The man uses this phrase as a term of endearment for the woman he loves. She is not actually his sister. You should translate this phrase the same way each time it occurs here, because the author uses it with the same meaning each time. See the note at the first occurrence of this phrase in [4:9](../04/09.md) for more information.

The original readers would have understood this to mean that the woman’s hair was black since goats in Israel were also black. Seen from a distance, a flock of black goats descending from the heights of Mount Gilead would have created a majestic visual effect because the goats would have looked like one long flowing mass of black. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: [Your black hair moves in graceful waves like a flock of black goats moving down the slopes of Mount Gilead] or [Your long black hair flows in graceful waves like a flock of black goats coming down the slopes of Mount Gilead]

She has not lost any of her teeth. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: [As a flock of female sheep that has born twin lambs without losing any, so your mouth has its teeth, each with a match, and none of them are missing]

4:3	j2a3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כְּ⁠פֶ֤לַח הָֽ⁠רִמּוֹן֙ רַקָּתֵ֔⁠ךְ	1	The writer could be comparing: (1) the shape of the woman’s **cheeks** to the shape of a **pomegranate** which has been sliced in half and to the red outside color of a pomegranate. Alternate translation: [Your cheeks are red and rounded like a slice of pomegranate] or [Your cheeks resemble the color and shape of a slice of pomegranate] or (if you decided that the term **cheeks** refers to the woman’s temples) [Your temples are red like a slice of pomegranate]; (2) the way the woman’s cheeks looked through the inside of the veil to the color and pattern of a **pomegranate** which has been sliced in half.

A long neck was considered beautiful in the writer’s culture. King David built some of his towers of beautiful marble rock. It is probable that this tower was made from marble since it is compared to the beauty of the woman’s neck. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: [Your neck is long and beautiful like the tower of David] or [Your neck is beautiful like the tower of David]
4:4	gvns		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	כְּ⁠מִגְדַּ֤ל דָּוִיד֙	1	The **tower of David** was a tall building built for defense. Towers were significantly taller than other buildings and often were not wide.

Here the man compares the beauty of the woman’s neck with **shields hanging on** the **tower of David**. This comparison probably included the decorations of the woman’s necklaces which probably went around her neck many times. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: [The beauty of your neck jeweled in necklaces is like a thousand warriors‘ shields hanging from a tower]
4:4	byh2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-numbers	אֶ֤לֶף	1	In the writer’s culture, the number **a thousand** was often used to represent a very large, but not precise, amount. This is how the number is being used here. Alternate translation: [with many]

Hebrew poetry often used this kind of parallel statement, in which the second line gives additional information, so it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect these two parallel phrases with “each of which” or “each one” in order to show that the second phrase is not repeating the first one but rather saying something additional. Alternate translation: [a thousand shields hanging on it, each of which belongs to the warriors] or [a thousand shields hanging on it, each one belonging to the warriors]

The context does not explicitly indicate how exactly the woman’s breasts are like young gazelles so it would be best if you leave the point of comparison unstated and simply express the simile as the author of this book has done.

The man is discreetly indicating that his bride’s breasts are pleasant smelling and that he wants to enjoy them. It would be good to retain this discreet and beautiful poetic imagery if possible. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly or use a comparison. Alternate translation: [I myself will go to your breasts, which are like two sweet-smelling mountains] or [I myself will be close to your breasts, which are like two pleasant-smelling hills]

This is poetry and the writer is not literally indicating that the woman is in the mountains and in danger. Rather, he is using this metaphor to express his feelings regarding the distance between them and his strong desire to have her near him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly.
4:8	h4yw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	אִתִּ֤⁠י & תָּב֑וֹאִי	1	Your language may say “go” rather than **come** in a context such as this. Use whichever is more natural. Alternate translation: [Go with me … go]

The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if it would be helpful for your readers, you could combine these two phrases into one as modeled by the UST.

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could also add the word “yes” to show that the phrase **You have enchanted my heart** is repeated in order to add emphasis. Alternate translation: [My sister, my bride; you have enchanted my heart. Yes, you have enchanted my heart]
4:9	d7n7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	לִבַּבְתִּ֖⁠נִי & לִבַּבְתִּ֨י⁠נִי֙	1	The phrase translated as **You have enchanted my heart** is an idiom which could mean: (1) to steal or capture a person’s heart. In Jewish thinking, the heart was the center of a person’s thinking. This phrase probably also meant that he was so in love that he could not think clearly. If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable phrase from your language that does have that meaning, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [You have captured my heart … you have captured my heart] or [It is as though you have captured my heart … it is as though you have captured my heart] or [You have made me feel so in love with you that it is as if I have lost my mind … you have made me feel so in love with you that it is as if I have lost my mind]; (2) the woman had made the man’s heart beat faster. Alternate translation: [You have caused my heart to beat fast … you have caused my heart to beat fast]; (3) that the woman had encouraged the man’s heart. Alternate translation: [You have encouraged my heart … you have encouraged my heart] or [You have given me heart … you have given me heart]
4:9	vdf7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֲחֹתִ֣⁠י	1	Here the man is speaking of the woman as if she were his **sister**. This is a term of endearment which expresses affection, close companionship, and a deep emotional bond between the lovers. The woman is not actually his sister.

Alternate translation: [Your kisses are so pleasant that it is as if your lips drip with nectar] or [Your kisses are delightfully sweet] or [Being kissed by you is as enjoyable as eating honey]
4:11	l8xe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	נֹ֛פֶת	1	The word translated as **nectar** refers specifically to honey which drips or flows from a honeycomb. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly by translating it as “honey”.

The man means that the woman’s body is beautiful and inaccessible like a locked spring or a sealed fountain. You could explain this comparison if it would be helpful to your readers. If you used the alternate translation, “You are like a locked garden, my sister, my bride”, then you should use the alternate translation which follows. Alternate translation: [you are like a locked spring; you are like a sealed fountain]

The word **shoots** is used here to refer to the woman so if it would be helpful to your readers, you could translate the phrase **Your shoots** as “You”. Alternately, you could translate it with a more general term that your language uses to speak of what grows out of plants and trees. Alternate translation: [Your sprouts are]

These plants and trees would not normally grow in the same garden because they have different growing requirements, but because this is poetry the author places these plants in one garden to create a poetic comparison for how wonderful the woman is. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate in a footnote that the author is using plants and trees from different areas to create an image of how wonderful the woman is.

If you translated [4:12–14](../04/12.md) using the words “You are like”, you should do that here also. See how you translated the word “garden” in [4:12](../04/12.md). Alternate translation: [you are like a fountain of gardens, like a well of living waters, and like flowing streams from Lebanon]
4:15	bj5a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מַעְיַ֣ן גַּנִּ֔ים	1	The writer assumes that the readers will understand that a **fountain** refers to a spring or underground well that is dug in order to be used as a water source.

She is doing this to communicate her strong desire that the pleasant smell of her body will flow through the air and attract the man she loves so that he will come to her. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate these words as a wish or desire.

The woman calls to the wind to blow on her **garden** so that **its spices flow** into the air and attract the man she loves. She invites him to **come to his garden** (a poetic way of inviting him to come and enjoy her body). You should translate the term **garden** here the same way you did in [4:12](../04/12.md) because both uses refer to the woman’s body. In [4:13](../04/13.md) the man spoke of her body as “an orchard of pomegranate trees with delicious fruits,” and here the woman invites the man to **come to his garden and eat its delicious fruit**. If you translated [4:12–15](../04/12.md) as a comparison, you should also translate the sentence **Let my beloved come to his garden and eat its delicious fruit** as a comparison.

5:intro	kdw4				0	# Song of Songs 5 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n[5:1](../05/01.md) The conclusion of the garden metaphor\n\n[5:2–8](../05/02.md) The theme of longing and searching\n\n[5:9](../05/09.md) The women of Jerusalem ask the young woman why she thinks the man she loves is special\n\n[5:10–16](../05/10.md) The woman responds to the question the young women of Jerusalem asked her\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### The attractiveness of the man\n\nThe woman describes the man as the epitome of male attractiveness in [5:10–16](../05/10.md).\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Metaphors\n\nAs the author has done throughout this book so far, he continues to use metaphors to describe feelings and events that are common to romantic relationships. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Order of events\n\n[5:2–8](../05/02.md) seems to describe events that would have chronologically and logically occurred before the events described in [3:6–5:1](../03/01.md). The solution to this seeming problem is to understand that this book is poetry and because the author is using poetry to describe the couple’s romantic relationship and its associated feelings, he does not need to follow the conventions of chronological story telling.\n\n### Whether [5:2–8](../05/02.md) describes events that really happened or that happened in a dream.\n\nThere are two main views among Bible scholars regarding the events described in [5:2–8](../05/02.md). One view is that the events which [5:2–8](../05/02.md) describe happened in a dream. The other view is that the events that [5:2–8](../05/02.md) describe happened after the man awakened the women from sleeping or from being nearly asleep. The vast majority of Bible scholars think that the first view is correct and that the events described in [5:2–8](../05/02.md) happened in a dream.\n\n### The “sister” metaphor\n\nThe phrase “my sister” is used in [4:9](../04/09.md), [4:10](../04/10.md), [4:12](../04/12.md), [5:1](../05/01.md), and [5:2](../05/02.md). The man uses this phrase as a term of endearment for the woman he loves. The woman is not actually his sister. You should translate this phrase in [5:1](../05/01.md) and [5:2](../05/02.md) the same way you translated it in [4:9](../04/09.md), [4:10](../04/10.md), and [4:12](../04/12.md), because the author uses it with the same meaning here. See the note at the first occurrence of this phrase in [4:9](../04/09.md) for more information.\n\n### An alternate translation possibility for the word the ULT translates as “towers of” in [5:13](../05/13.md)\n\nIn [verse 13](../05/13.md), the ULT follows the standard Hebrew text by saying “towers of.” However, as a footnote in the ULT indicates, many biblical scholars believe that the original reading was more likely “yielding.” Consider using that reading in your translation. If “yielding” is used in place of “towers of” then the first portion of [5:13](../05/13.md) in the ULT would read “His cheeks {are} like a bed of spices, yielding herbal spices” (and The UST would read “His cheeks are like a garden where spices grow that produce sweet-smelling perfume”). The phrase “yielding herbal spices” would then be further describing the phrase “a bed of spices.” The point of the comparison would be that the man’s cheeks smell like a garden bed of spices which yields herbal spices. If you choose to use the word “yielding” in your translation, you could explain the comparison if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [His cheeks smell like a bed of spices that produce herbal spices] or [His cheeks smell like a bed of spices that yield herbal spices]

He accepts the woman’s invitation (that she gave in the previous verse) to enjoy her body. The lines **I have plucked my myrrh with my spice** and **I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey** and **I have drunk my wine with my milk** are all metaphors for the man enjoying the woman’s body.

(See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]])\n\n### The meaning of [6:12](../06/12.md)\n\n[6:12](../06/12.md) is very difficult to understand, and its meaning is uncertain. Therefore, Bible scholars have different opinions on the exact meaning of this verse, and of some of the words in context, and on how the words and phrases relate to each other. Published versions of the Bible differ significantly from one another in their rendering of it. The ULT seeks to offer a reasonable translation of this verse. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, it may differ from the ULT in the way that it translates this verse. In that case, you may wish to use the rendering that it uses. If not, you may wish to follow the rendering of the ULT.\n\n### The meaning of the phrase “like the dance of two armies” in [6:13](../06/13.md)\n\nThe meaning of the phrase “like the dance of two armies” is uncertain and Bible scholars have different opinions on the exact meaning of this verse. The ULT offers one possible translation of this verse. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, it may differ from the ULT in the way that it translates this verse. In that case, you may wish to use the translation that it uses. If not, you may wish to follow the reading of the ULT.

This question is asked twice, in slightly different ways, for emphasis and poetic effect. This type of repetition is a common feature of Hebrew poetry, and it would be good to retain this repetition if possible. However, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine the phrases into one. Alternate translation: [Where did he go, your beloved, most beautiful woman among women? Let us seek him with you] or [Most beautiful woman among women, where did he turn your beloved? Let us seek him with you]
6:1	tgqz			אָ֚נָה הָלַ֣ךְ דּוֹדֵ֔⁠ךְ & אָ֚נָה פָּנָ֣ה דוֹדֵ֔⁠ךְ	1	Alternate translation: [Where did your beloved go … Where did your beloved turn]

The phrase **graze in the gardens** and **glean lilies** are both metaphors for the man enjoying the woman’s body. If you used the word “like” to translate [4:12–5:1](../04/12.md), you should continue to use it here, or if it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [My beloved went to me. I am like a garden where beds of spices grow. He came to me in order to enjoy my body like a gazelle enjoys grazing in gardens and like a person enjoys gleaning lilies]

These lines are parallel, and both mean basically the same thing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state that explicitly. Alternately, you could combine the lines if it would be helpful to your readers.

6:4	ydky		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	אֲיֻמָּ֖ה כַּ⁠נִּדְגָּלֽוֹת	1	The man is saying that the woman is **awe-inspiring like bannered armies** because looking at her causes the man to feel a sense of awe that is comparable to seeing an army with its banners above it. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: [and the awe I feel when looking at you is like the awe I would feel if I were to see armies with their banners] or [and the awe I feel when looking at you is like the awe I feel when I see armies with their banners above them]

The man is using the 3, 4 pattern that was commonly used at that time, and for emphasis he multiples the numbers 3 and 4 by the number 20. This gives the numbers **Sixty** and **eighty** that he uses to make his point. If your language has a way to indicate poetry, you could use it here.

6:8	vks6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	וַ⁠עֲלָמ֖וֹת אֵ֥ין מִסְפָּֽר	1	Here, **without number** is an idiom that means “more than can be counted.” If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [and too many marriageable women to count] or [and more marriageable women than can be counted]
6:8-9	v080		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	שִׁשִּׁ֥ים הֵ֨מָּה֙ מְּלָכ֔וֹת וּ⁠שְׁמֹנִ֖ים פִּֽילַגְשִׁ֑ים וַ⁠עֲלָמ֖וֹת אֵ֥ין מִסְפָּֽר׃ אַחַ֥ת הִיא֙ יוֹנָתִ֣⁠י תַמָּתִ֔⁠י אַחַ֥ת הִיא֙ לְ⁠אִמָּ֔⁠הּ בָּרָ֥ה הִ֖יא לְ⁠יֽוֹלַדְתָּ֑⁠הּ	1	This is a comparison that expresses that the woman is superior to women in a king’s royal court. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could add words that explicitly indicate that this is a comparison. Alternate translation: [When compared to sixty queens, eighty concubines, and marriageable women without number, none of them are as special as my dove; my perfect one who is special to her mother and pure to the woman who bore her] or [Even if compared to sixty queens, eighty concubines, and marriageable women without number, still none of them would be as special as my dove; my perfect one who is special to her mother and pure to the woman who bore her]
6:9	ue94		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אַחַ֥ת הִיא֙	1	Here the phrase **One is she** means “She is special” (the number **One** is used in contrast to the large numbers of other women described in the previous verse). If it would be helpful to your readers, you could include this information. Alternate translation: [She is special] or [She is unique] or [She is special in comparison to other women]

6:9	tej6			אַחַ֥ת הִיא֙ לְ⁠אִמָּ֔⁠הּ	1	The phrase **one is she to her mother** could mean: (1) that the woman the man loves is special to her mother (in contrast to the large numbers of other women described in the previous verse). Alternate translation: [she is special to her mother] or [her mother thinks she is special] or [her mother thinks she is unique]; (2) that the woman was the only child or the only daughter of her mother. Alternate translation: [she is the only child of her mother] or [her mother’s only daughter]
6:9	wmx6			בָּרָ֥ה הִ֖יא לְ⁠יֽוֹלַדְתָּ֑⁠הּ	1	The phrase **pure is she to the woman who bore her** could mean: (1) that the woman was her mother’s favorite child or favorite daughter. Alternate translation: [the favorite child of the woman who bore her] or [the favorite daughter of the woman who bore her]; (2) that the woman was pure or flawless in some way. Alternate translation: [flawless is she to the woman who bore her]

The second line emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition. It would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine these two lines into one. Alternate translation: [her mother thinks that she is very special] or [she is very special to her mother]
6:9	al8y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בָנוֹת֙	1	Here the word **daughters** could refer to: (1) the “marriageable women” in the previous verse.

Alternate translation: [The young women]

However, if you are using section headers, the speaker or speakers could be: (1) the man speaking to the woman he loves. You can follow the example of the UST and include this verse under the section heading for [6:4–10](../06/04.md) that indicates the man is speaking. (2) the “daughters,” the “queens,” and the “concubines” mentioned in the previous verse. You can use a phrase for the section header such as “The daughters, the queens, and the concubines praise the woman” or “The other women praise the woman” or something comparable.

If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation and communicate the emphasis in another way.

6:10	qk20		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	הַ⁠נִּשְׁקָפָ֖ה כְּמוֹ־שָׁ֑חַר	1	Here the man speaks of the woman and compares her to the sun as it dawns in the morning.

He then says that her beauty is like the beauty of **the moon**. He then compares the woman’s radiance to the radiance of **the sun**. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state these comparisons explicitly.

Because the author does not say, you should not indicate who is speaking in the text of your translation. However, if you are using section headers, the speaker could be: (1) the man in both verses. If you decide the man is speaking, you can include these two verses under the section heading for [6:4–11](../06/04.md). (2) the woman in both verses. If you decide the woman is speaking, you can put a section header at the top of [6:11](../06/11.md).

Because the author does not say who is speaking here, you should not indicate a speaker in the text of your translation. However, if you are using section headers, the speaker could be: (1) the young women of Jerusalem. If you decide this is who is speaking, you can indicate that with a section header. (2) friends of the man and woman. If you decide that this is who is speaking, you can place a section header indicating that. (3) the man.

If your language can repeat words for emphasis, it would be good to do that here. If not, your language may express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: [Return Shulammite, return and let us look at you] or [Please return Shulammite, and let us look at you]

Because the author does not say who is speaking here, you should not indicate this in the text of your translation. However, if you are using section headers to indicate who is speaking, the speaker could be: (1) the man. If you decide that the man is speaking here, you can indicate this with a section header above this part of the verse. (2) the woman speaking of herself in the third person. If you decide that the woman is speaking here, you can place a section header indicating this.

6:13	rd4z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כִּ⁠מְחֹלַ֖ת הַֽ⁠מַּחֲנָֽיִם	1	This phrase could be translated as: (1) **like the dance of two armies** which refers to a dance that is performed as entertainment for armies. Alternate translation: [like a dance performed before armies]; (2) “like the dance of Mahanaim” (3) “like two rows of dancers” or “like two companies of dancers” and mean “as you like to watch two rows of people dancing.” See the section in the Chapter 6 introduction for more information about how to translate this phrase.
7:intro	hqv7				0	# Song of Songs 7 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Beauty\n\nIn [7:1–7](../07/01.md) the man describes the woman as the epitome of female beauty and attractiveness using various comparisons.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Comparisons\n\nThere are many comparisons in this chapter. Their purpose is to describe the beauty of the woman and to describe romantic love between a man and a woman. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile]]) and (See:[[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### An alternate translation possibility for the word the ULT translates as “love” in [7:6](../07/06.md)\n\nIn [verse 6](../07/06.md) the ULT follows the standard Hebrew text by saying “love.” However, as a footnote indicates, many biblical scholars believe that the original reading was more likely “one who is loved.” Consider using that reading in your translation. If “one who is loved” is used instead of “love,” then the portion of [7:6](../07/06.md) that the ULT translates as “love with delights!” would instead be translated “one who is loved with all your delights!”\n\n### An alternate translation possibility for the words that the ULT translates as “the lips of those who sleep” in [7:9](../07/09.md)\n\nIn [verse 9](../07/09.md) the ULT follows the standard Hebrew text by saying “the lips of those who sleep.” However, as a footnote indicates, many biblical scholars believe that the original reading was more likely “lips and teeth.” The translators of the Septuagint (the ancient Greek translation of the Old Testament) thought this and translated this phrase as “my lips and my teeth.” If a Bible translation exists in your region that translates this phrase with the word “teeth” instead of “those who sleep,” consider using “lips and teeth” instead of “the lips of those who sleep” in your translation.

The man begins speaking directly to the woman in this verse and continues speaking to her until part way through [7:9](../07/09.md).

The phrase **that never lacks spiced wine** describes what is inside the rounded bowl. It probably means that, as **spiced wine** excites the man and gives him joy, so her navel excites him and gives him joy. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the comparison. Alternate translation: [Your navel is beautifully rounded and causes me to feel excited] or [Your navel is beautifully rounded like a wine bowl, and it causes me to feel excited like drinking spiced wine] or [Your navel is beautifully rounded like a bowl and gives me joy and excitement like when I drink spiced wine]

He compares her **belly** to **a heap of wheat**, a food that satisfies hunger just as the woman satisfies him. The comparison extends to her shape which is soft and curved just like a heap of wheat. He also compares the color of her belly to wheat since a **heap of wheat** is a golden beige or tan color. The phrase **encircled with the lilies** describes the heap of wheat and probably means that, just as **a heap of wheat encircled with the lilies** looks beautiful, so her belly is beautiful. If it would be helpful in your language, you could explain these comparisons. Alternate translation: [Your belly is as beautiful as a heap of wheat that is encircled with lilies, and it satisfies me] or [The shape and color of your belly is beautiful] or [Your belly is beautiful and satisfying]

It may be that the woman’s eyes sparkle or shine in the light like when light shines on water, that her eyes look mysterious and deep (and possibly dark) like a deep pool of water, or that her eyes reflect light like a pool of water.

She is comparing herself to Solomon’s vineyard (discussed in [8:11](../08/11.md)) and saying that Solomon and his vineyard keepers can keep the profits from that vineyard. (2) that the woman is speaking of herself as a vineyard but saying that she chooses to give herself freely to the man whom she loves and calls Solomon. (3) that the man is speaking of the woman he loves as a vineyard and is comparing his vineyard to Solomon’s vineyard. He feels wealthier than Solomon because he has the woman he loves as his vineyard, and so Solomon and Solomon’s keepers can keep their portion of the profits from that vineyard.

The meaning could be: (1) that they would make an effort to protect her virginity. Alternate translation: [We will protect her virginity like we would enclose a door with boards of cedar]; (2) that her chest was flat because her breasts were not fully formed, and so they would try to make her more attractive for the man she was going to marry by adorning her the way they would decorate a door with cedar wood. (The word the ULT translates as **enclose** is identical in form to another word which means “decorate” so “decorate” could be the intended meaning here.)
