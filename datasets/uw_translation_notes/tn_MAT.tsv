The crucifixion of Jesus, his death, and his resurrection ([26:1–28:19](../26/01.md))\n\n### What is Matthew about?\n\nThe Gospel of Matthew is one of four books in the New Testament that describe some of the life of Jesus Christ. These books are called “Gospels,” which means “good news.” Their authors wrote about different aspects of who Jesus was and what he did. Matthew wrote much about how Jesus fulfilled passages from the Old Testament. Also, he focused on Jesus’ teaching by presenting some of what Jesus said in five separate speeches, or “discourses.” Many Christians think that Matthew expected his first readers to be Jewish people. However, Matthew also intended his Gospel to be read by all Christians.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nTranslators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “The Gospel of Matthew,” or “The Gospel According to Matthew.” Or they may choose a different title, such as, “The Good News About Jesus that Matthew Wrote.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])\n\n### Who wrote the book of Matthew?\n\nThe book does not give the name of the author. However, since early Christian times, most Christians have thought that the author was the Apostle Matthew. This man named Matthew was a tax collector who became one of Jesus’ 12 closest disciples. In this book, Matthew appears in [9:9–10](../09/09.md) and [10:3](../10/03.md). (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/names/matthew]])\n\n## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### What does the phrase “the kingdom of the heavens” mean?\n\nWhile the other Gospels frequently use the phrase “the kingdom of God,” Matthew only uses that phrase four times (see [12:28](../12/28.md); [19:24](../19/24.md); [21:31](../21/31.md); and [21:43](../21/43.md)). Instead, Matthew frequently uses the phrase “the kingdom of the heavens.” There are two primary issues to consider when translating this phrase: (1) whether “of the heavens” means the same thing as “of God,” and (2) what the word “kingdom” describes.\n\nFirst (1), does “of the heavens” mean the same thing as “of God”? Some scholars think that Matthew chose to refer to God politely by using the phrase “the heavens,” which would mean that “the kingdom of the heavens” is simply another way to say “the kingdom of God.” However, since Matthew does use the phrase “the kingdom of God” occasionally, it is more likely that the phrase “the kingdom of the heavens” means something slightly different than “the kingdom of God.” It probably refers to the place where the “kingdom” is already present: the heavens. The plural form “heavens” indicates that Matthew is referring to all of heavenly space. The UST expresses the idea of “of the heavens” with the adjective “heavenly.”\n\nSecond (2), what does the word “kingdom” describe? In general, the word refers to a monarch ruling over a group of people in a specific area. In various contexts, the word can primarily emphasize the area, the people, or the ruling. However, the term usually refers to all three of these elements, even if one is emphasized more than the others. Consider how you might express the idea of “kingdom” in your language. Some translations emphasize the idea of ruling and express the idea with a clause like “God ruling as king” or “God’s reign.” Other translations emphasize the idea of the people who are ruled and express the idea with a clause like “belonging to God’s people.” However, both of these options do not fully express the idea of “kingdom.” If you have a word or phrase that describes a situation in which a king rules over people in a specific area, you could use it here. Since that word in English is “kingdom,” the ULT and UST both use “kingdom.” (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/kingdom]], [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/heaven]], and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/kingdomofgod]])\n\n### What were “disciples” in Jesus’ culture?\n\nIn both Jewish culture and in Greco-Roman culture, teachers had “disciples” who learned from them and were committed to them. Sometimes these disciples would go wherever their teacher went and imitate what the teacher did. Jesus’ disciples similarly were committed to him and learned from him. Some of his closest disciples traveled and lived with Jesus, particularly those whom Matthew refers to as The Twelve. Other disciples would go to see Jesus and learn from him, but they did not always travel or live with him. Consider how you might refer to these kinds of relationships in your language. The ULT expresses the idea with the word “disciple,” and the UST uses the word “apprentice.” (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/disciple]])\n\n### Why does Jesus refer to himself as the “Son of Man”?\n\nIn the Gospels, Jesus calls himself the “Son of Man.” This phrase can express two primary ideas:\n\n1. It can refer to someone who is a human. This meaning for the phrase appears frequently in the book of Ezekiel (for example, see [Ezekiel 2:1](../../ezk/02/01.md) or [Ezekiel 47:6](../../ezk/47/06.md)). So, Jesus uses the phrase to refer to himself in the third person while identifying himself as a human being.\n2. It can refer more specifically to a specific person who appears in [Daniel 7:13–14](../../dan/07/13.md). This person approaches God, who gives him dominion and authority. So, when he uses the phrase, Jesus is identifying himself with this person. Scholars are not sure whether people in Jesus’ culture used the title “Son of Man” to refer to the Messiah. However, Jesus is probably using the title to implicitly claim a special role, perhaps that of the Messiah.\n\nThere are three primary issues to consider when translating the phrase “the Son of Man”:\n\n1. When Jesus uses the phrase, he is referring to himself in the third person. If your readers would not understand this, you may need to express the idea in the first person. See the notes on the phrase “the Son of Man” throughout the book for ways to do this.\n2. The phrase figuratively refers to someone who is human by identifying that person’s father as a “man.” If that figure of speech does not make sense in your language, you could refer to someone who is human in another way. Some translations use a phrase like “the human one” to express the idea.\n3. The phrase refers to the specific figure from the book of Daniel. If you have a translation of the book of Daniel, you could translate the phrase as it is expressed there. If you do not have a translation of the book of Daniel, you could consider translating the phrase as a title that refers to a special person, implicitly the Messiah. You could make this clear by capitalizing the phrase (for example, “the Human One”) or by using a different form that indicates that this is a title (for example, “the one called Son of Man”).\n\nA note related to translating the idea of “Son of Man” appears at its first occurrence. After that, if possible express the idea consistently throughout the rest of the book. Notes providing translation options for expressing the idea in first person instead of third person appear at every occurrence. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]])\n\n## Part 3: Important Translation Issues\n\n### What are the Synoptic Gospels?\n\nThe Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke are called the Synoptic Gospels because they have many similar passages. The word “synoptic” means to “see together.”\n\nThe texts are considered “parallel” when they are the same or almost the same among two or three Gospels. The ULT represents these parallels by using the same words whenever the parallel passages are exactly the same. When the parallel passages are slightly different, the ULT represents the differences as much as possible by using different words. Make sure that your translation represents these similarities and differences as closely as possible.\n\n### What do “crowd” and “crowds” refer to in Matthew?\n\nMatthew uses the words “crowd” and “crowds” about 50 times. In most cases, the words refer to the “crowds” that gather where Jesus is. Some of the people in these crowds were disciples. Others were curious about who Jesus was and what he taught. Others wanted Jesus to heal them or give them food. The difference between the singular “crowd” and the plural “crowds” is small. Most likely, the singular refers to all the people viewed together as one group, while the plural refers to multiple different groups of people. Consider how you might best refer to large groups of people who are gathered together for some specific purpose.\n\n### What does Matthew mean when he writes that a quotation from the Old Testament was “fulfilled”?\n\nMatthew consistently indicates that things happen to “fulfill” passages from the Old Testament. He means that the event or situation he is describing somehow matches what the Old Testament passage or passages say. Sometimes the Old Testament passage includes a prediction that comes true during Jesus’ life. Sometimes the Old Testament passage uses words or phrases that match the words or phrases Matthew uses to tell his story. Sometimes the Old Testament passage is completed or explained by something Jesus says or does. Consider how you might indicate that an event, situation, or spoken or written words fit with or match a passage from an important text. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/fulfill]])\n\n### When is “you” singular, and when is “you” plural?\n\nAs he is telling his story, Matthew uses both singular and plural forms of “you.” These were distinct in his language, but in English both singular and plural are expressed with the word “you.” So, in the introduction to each chapter, there is a section stating whether Matthew uses the singular or plural form of “you” more frequently in that chapter. Then, notes throughout the chapter will indicate whenever Matthew uses the less frequent form of “you.” Look for this section in each chapter introduction if your language distinguishes between singular and plural forms of “you.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### What are the major issues in the text of the book of Matthew?\n\nSome versions of the Bible include some verses in Matthew that other versions do not include. This is because some ancient manuscripts include these verses. However, the best ancient manuscripts do not include them. Here are the verses:\n  * “Evening having come, you say, ‘It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.’ And in early morning, ‘Today will be stormy, for the sky is red, being overcast.’ You know to interpret the face of the sky, but the signs of the times you are not able” ([16:2b–3](../16/02.md)).\n  * “But this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting” ([17:21](../17/21.md)).\n  * “For the Son of Man came to save the one that has been lost” ([18:11](../18/11.md)).\n  * “But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour the houses of widows, also for a pretext praying at length. For this reason, you will receive greater judgment” ([23:14](../23/14.md)).\n\nIt is recommended that you do not include these passages. However, if in your region, there are older versions of the Bible that include one or more of these passages, you may include them. If they are included, they should be put in footnotes or inside square brackets to indicate that they were probably not originally part of Matthew.\n\nFurther, there are at least two different versions of the parable of the two sons in [21:28–31](../21/28.md). See the introduction to [chapter 21](../21/01.md) for more information.\n\nFinally, in the following verses, ancient manuscripts do not all have the same words. The ULT uses the words that are found in most of the earliest manuscripts. When you translate these verses, you should compare the ULT with any translations with which your readers may be familiar to see what your readers may expect. Unless there is a good reason to use the alternate words, you should follow the ULT. See the footnotes and notes at each of these verses for more information. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])\n\n  * “say every evil thing against you, lying, because of me” ([5:11](../05/11.md)).

1:intro	y7kk				0	# Matthew 1 Chapter Notes\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. The birth of Jesus Christ and the beginning of his ministry ([1:1–4:25](../01/01.md))\n      * The genealogy of Jesus ([1:1–17](../01/01.md))\n      * Jesus’ parents and birth ([1:18–25](../01/18.md))\n\nSome translations set a quotation from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this in [1:23](../01/23.md) with the quote from [Isaiah 7:14](../../isa/07/14.md).\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Genealogy\n\nA genealogy is a list that records a person’s ancestors or descendants. Genealogies were important to the Jewish people because family lineage is how they decided how someone functioned in society. For instance, if someone was a descendant of Aaron, they were able to become priests. Similarly, if someone was a descendant of King David, they were able to become a king. This genealogy shows that Jesus was clearly a descendant of King David, and therefore, was able to become king.\n\n### The word “fathered”\n\nWhen Matthew uses the word “fathered,” he only means that the older man was an ancestor of the younger man. In most cases, the older man is the direct father of the younger man. However, sometimes the older man is a grandfather (for example, Josiah is the grandfather of Jechoniah) or a more distant ancestor (for example, Joram is the great-great-grandfather of Ozias). If possible, use a word that indicates that the older man is the ancestor of the younger man without stating that the older man is the father of the younger man. If you need to be more specific, the UST provides one way to do so.\n\n### Three groups of 14\n\nMatthew concludes the genealogy by dividing it up into three groups of 14 generations. He divides the groups by using two key events in Israel’s history: David starting his dynasty and the Babylonians capturing Jerusalem. In order to count 14 generations from Abraham until David, both Abraham and David need to be included. To count 14 generations from David until the Babylonian deportation, David needs to be excluded but Jechoniah needs to be included. To count 14 generations from the Babylonian deportation until the Christ, both Jechoniah and Christ need to be included. The ULT and UST divide the section into paragraphs based on the divisions. Consider how you might show these divisions in your translation.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nAll of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in instructions that an angel gives to Joseph. Because of that, all forms of “you” in this chapter are singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### Stating that Mary became pregnant\n\nIn [1:18](../01/18.md), [1:20](../01/20.md), and [1:23](../01/23.md), Matthew refers to a woman becoming pregnant, but he excludes the involvement of a man in the process. He uses the phrases “to have in the womb” and “having been conceived in her” to avoid referring to the male role in conception. In your translation, you should not identify the Holy Spirit as the one who performed the normal male role, since the Holy Spirit did not have sex with Mary. Instead, the Holy Spirit performed a miracle. So, use a form that does not refer to the male role in conception or a form that denies that a man was involved.\n\n### Translating names\n\nIn the genealogy, Matthew uses specific Greek spellings of names. These spellings do not always match the Hebrew spellings of the names that you can read in the Old Testament. The ULT and UST spell out how these names sound as Matthew wrote them in Greek. In contrast, some translations spell out these names as they appear in the Old Testament. Consider spelling these names as do other translations that your readers might be familiar with. Otherwise, consider whether your team wishes to spell names in the same way throughout the Bible or whether you will spell them differently in different places. If you do spell them differently in different places, you may need to include footnotes that provide other spellings.

1:6	msbw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐκ τῆς τοῦ Οὐρίου	1	**Uriah** was one of the leaders of the Israelite army, a leader whom **David** trusted. However, David saw Uriah’s wife, named Bathsheba, and wanted her for himself. He had Uriah killed and took Uriah’s wife for himself. You can read about this story in [2 Samual 11:1–27](../../2sa/11/01.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could include some extra information if your readers would not know this story. Alternate translation: [by Bathsheba the wife of Uriah, whom he had killed]

In the list of kings in [1 Chronicles 3](../../1ch/03/01.md), however, there are four names between **Joram** and **Jotham** (see [1 Chronicles 3:11–12](../../1co/03/11.md)), not one. So, Matthew has not mentioned three of these kings, and the word translated as **fathered** only requires the older person to be an ancestor of the younger person, who could be a son, grandson, great-grandson, or even great-great-grandson. It is unclear exactly where in the list Matthew leaves out the three kings. He could be using the name **Ozias**: (1) to refer to the king that 1 Chronicles names “Azariah.” In this case, **Ozias** is the great-great-grandson of **Joram** and the father of **Jotham**. Alternate translation: [and Joram was the great-great-grandfather of Ozias, and Ozias fathered Jotham]; (2) to refer to the king that 1 Chronicles names “Ahaziah.” In this case, **Ozias** is the son of **Joram** and the great-great-grandfather of **Jotham**.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that **Josiah** was the grandfather of **Jechoniah**. Alternate translation: [Josiah fathered the father of Jechoniah]
1:11	vzs3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς αὐτοῦ	1	If you must specify whether these **brothers** were older or younger, it is more likely that they were younger brothers. Alternate translation: [his younger brothers]
1:11	v2im		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐπὶ τῆς μετοικεσίας Βαβυλῶνος	1	Matthew refers to how the Babylonians conquered Jerusalem and took most of the people away to the country of Babylon.

1:12	y7cx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μετὰ & τὴν μετοικεσίαν Βαβυλῶνος	1	Matthew refers to the same event that he referred to in [1:11](../01/11.md).

However, early Greek translations of [1 Chronicles 3:19](../../1co/03/19.md) list **Salathiel** as the father of **Zerubabbel**. Matthew most likely used a source like these early Greek translations, so he probably intended his readers to think of **Salathiel** as the father of **Zerubbabel** and not as his uncle. If it would be helpful in your language, you could include some of this information in a footnote.

To count 14 generations **from David until the Babylonian deportation**, David needs to be excluded but Jechoniah needs to be included. To count 14 generations **from the Babylonian deportation until the Christ**, both Jechoniah and Jesus need to be included. Consider how you might express the calculations so that they match with the list. Alternate translation: [from Abraham up to and including David were 14 generations, and after David and until the Babylonian deportation were 14 generations, and starting with the Babylonian deportation and counting up to and including the Christ were 14 generations]

1:18	gnl6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	τοῦ δὲ Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ ἡ γένεσις οὕτως ἦν	1	Here, the word **Now** introduces a new section in this book that focuses on **the birth of Jesus Christ**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a new section, or you could leave **Now** untranslated. Alternate translation: [As for the birth of Jesus Christ, it happened thus]
1:18	cqt1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	μνηστευθείσης & τῷ Ἰωσήφ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

1:18	xvk1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	πρὶν & συνελθεῖν αὐτοὺς	1	Matthew is referring in a polite way to having sex by using the phrase **came together**.

Rather, she became pregnant because the Holy Spirit caused her to be pregnant. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [by the power of the Holy Spirit] or [because of the Holy Spirit’s work]
1:19	h941		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **Now** introduces the next major event in the story. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the next event, or you could leave **Now** untranslated. Alternate translation: [Then,]
1:19	yufg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	Ἰωσὴφ & ὁ ἀνὴρ αὐτῆς	1	Matthew implies that Joseph did not know that the baby came from the Holy Spirit. Joseph thought that Mary had become pregnant after having sex with another man, which is why he wanted **to divorce her**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that Joseph did not know that the Holy Spirit had caused Mary to be pregnant. Alternate translation: [Joseph her husband thought that she had been unfaithful, so]
1:19	pu3p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ ἀνὴρ αὐτῆς & ἀπολῦσαι αὐτήν	1	As the previous verse shows (see [1:18](../01/18.md)), Mary and Joseph were not yet married. In their culture, however, being “engaged” was a promise to marry, so Matthew can refer to **Joseph** as Mary’s **husband**. He can also refer to breaking the engagement as divorce. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that Matthew is referring to an engaged man breaking the engagement. Alternate translation: [her fiancé … to break the engagement with her]

Alternate translation: [the one having been conceived in Mary is from the Holy Spirit, so you should not fear to take her as your wife]
1:20	va5e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τὸ & ἐν αὐτῇ γεννηθὲν ἐκ Πνεύματός ἐστιν Ἁγίου	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

Alternate translation: [and because he will save his people from their sins, you will call his name Jesus]
1:21	ifq8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	καλέσεις	1	Here the angel gives a command using the future tense.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could explain what Jesus’ name means or include this information in a footnote.

1:22	rlse		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	τοῦτο & ὅλον γέγονεν	1	The pronoun **this** refers to what Matthew has said about Mary becoming pregnant before she and Joseph were married (see [1:18–21](../01/18.md)). If this is not clear for your readers, you could refer more directly to these events. Alternate translation: [Jesus was born in that way] or [what I have told you happened]

1:22	e8ld		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	λέγοντος	1	In Matthew’s culture, **saying** was a normal way to introduce a quotation from an important text, in this case, the Old Testament book written by Isaiah the prophet (see [Isaiah 7:14](../../isa/07/14.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase that indicates that Matthew is quoting from an important text. Alternate translation: [who wrote in the book of Isaiah] or [who declared]
1:23	wlft		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	The word **Behold** draws the attention of the audience and asks them to listen carefully. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express behold with a word or phrase that asks the audience to listen, or you could draw the audience’s attention in another way. Alternate translation: [I tell you] or [Listen to me:]
1:23	c6yk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἡ παρθένος	1	Although the word translated as **virgin** occasionally refers to any young woman, whether she has had sex or not, the word normally refers to a young woman who has not had sex. This is what Matthew means here, so you should use a word or phrase that refers to a woman who is old enough to get married but who has not yet had sex. Alternate translation: [the marriageable woman who has not had sex]
1:23	nlp1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν γαστρὶ ἕξει	1	Here, the phrase **have in her womb** refers to a woman being pregnant.

1:23	lm6t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὅ ἐστιν μεθερμηνευόμενον, μεθ’ ἡμῶν ὁ Θεός.	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

1:25	i7p5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	οὐκ ἐγίνωσκεν αὐτὴν	1	Matthew is referring in a polite way to having sex by using the word **know**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a polite way of referring to this in your language, or you could state this plainly. See how you translated the euphemism for having sex in [1:18](../01/18.md). Alternate translation: [he did not consummate the marriage with her] or [he did not sleep with her]
1:25	v3xe		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	οὐκ ἐγίνωσκεν & ἐκάλεσεν & αὐτοῦ	1	Here, both times the pronoun **he** occurs, it refers to Joseph.

Alternate translation: [Joseph did not know … Joseph called the son’s]
1:25	mclm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	ἕως οὗ	1	Christians disagree about whether Joseph had sex with Mary after Jesus was born.

The birth of Jesus Christ and the beginning of his ministry ([1:1–4:25](../01/01.md))\n      * The visit of the learned men ([2:1–12](../02/01.md))\n      * Joseph, Mary, and Jesus escape to Egypt ([2:13–15](../02/13.md))\n      * Herod kills the baby boys in Bethlehem ([2:16–18](../02/16.md))\n      * Joseph, Mary, and Jesus settle in Nazareth ([2:19–23](../02/19.md))\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [verses 6](../02/06.md) and [18](../02/18.md), which are quotations from the Old Testament.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### “Learned men”\n\nIn this chapter, Matthew tells about how “learned men” from countries to the east of Judea visited Jesus in order to worship him. These were educated men who studied dreams and stars in the sky to try to learn about what was happening and what would happen in the future. Matthew does not present them as if they are evil. Consider how you might naturally refer to this kind of educated man. The ULT provides a general translation (“learned men”), and the UST illustrates how to use a descriptive phrase (“scholars who studied the stars”).\n\n### The star\n\nThe learned men journey to Jerusalem because they see a specific star. Matthew further describes how this star moved in the sky until it was directly above where Jesus was living. It is not clear exactly what this star was. Scholars have suggested that it was one of the planets, a shooting star, a comet, or a bright angel. If possible, use a word or phrase that refers generally to a natural source of light in the sky. If you need to be more specific, you could use a word or phrase that refers to stars, especially the kinds of stars that move or appear to move in the sky.\n\n### The journeys of Joseph, Mary, and Jesus\n\nIn this chapter, Matthew narrates several journeys that Joseph, Mary, and Jesus took. At first, they are in Bethlehem, which is a city near the capital city of Judea, Jerusalem. After the learned men visit, God warns Joseph to journey to Egypt, a country to the southwest of Judea, in order to escape from Herod, the king of Judea. After Herod dies, God tells Joseph that he can take his family back to Israel. However, he does not take his family back to Judea, because Herod’s son is now reigning in Herod’s place. Instead, he and his family travel to Nazareth, a city in the region of Galilee, which is north of Judea. When Matthew uses movement words, make sure that your translation fits with these journeys.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMost of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in direct speech to individuals. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are singular. You should assume forms of “you” are singular unless a note specifies that the form is plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])

Matthew uses this phrase because the learned men considered Jesus to be a king, but Matthew considers Jesus to be God. So, both meanings of the phrase **to worship** are included here. If possible, use a form that could be used for how one acts before both kings and God. If you must make a distinction, it is recommended that you use a form that refers to worshiping God.

2:18	k91t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	φωνὴ & ἠκούσθη	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [There was a voice] or [People heard a voice]
2:18	x062		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	κλαυθμὸς καὶ ὀδυρμὸς πολύς	1	The terms **weeping** and **great mourning** mean similar things. Matthew is using the two terms together for emphasis.

2:18	sve3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	οὐκ ἤθελεν παρακληθῆναι, ὅτι οὐκ εἰσίν	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these clauses, since the second clause gives the reason for the result that the first clause describes.

Alternate translation: [they had passed away] or [because they had died]
2:19	vupx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	δὲ	1	Here, the word **Now** introduces the next major event in the story.

2:19	o6s1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	φαίνεται	1	To call attention to a development in the story, Matthew uses the present tense in past narration.

2:20	pljv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	λέγων	1	Consider natural ways of introducing direct quotations in your language. Alternate translation: [and he commanded him]

2:22	dy6b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	χρηματισθεὶς	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

Alternate translation: [God having warned him] or [an angel of the Lord having warned him]

2:23	oxc9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κατῴκησεν	1	Matthew implies that Mary and Jesus also lived in **Nazareth** with Joseph. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [Joseph, Mary, and Jesus lived]
2:23	lax1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	λεγομένην	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [that people called] or [whose name was]
2:23	rwhw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ὅπως	1	Here, the phrase **so that** could introduce: (1) a result from Joseph and his family living in Nazareth. Alternate translation: [with the result that]; (2) a purpose for which Joseph and his family lived in Nazareth.

2:23	vxb8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	τῶν προφητῶν, ὅτι Ναζωραῖος κληθήσεται	1	It may be more natural in your language to have a direct quotation here. Alternate translation: [the prophets, “He will be called a Nazarene.”]
2:23	okmw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	τῶν προφητῶν	1	Matthew does not clarify which **prophets** he is referring to, and there is no single passage in the Old Testament that speaks about Jesus being a **Nazarene**. Because of that, you should not include any implied information here. If possible, leave the statement as general as it appears in the ULT. Alternate translation: [God’s prophets] or [prophets]
2:23	sa9k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	Ναζωραῖος κληθήσεται	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, you could use an indefinite subject. Alternate translation: [they will call him a Nazarene]
2:23	yrb7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	κληθήσεται	1	The pronoun **he** refers to the Messiah. If this is not clear for your readers, you could refer to the Messiah more directly. The **prophets** probably did not know that his name would be Jesus, so you should use a title like “Christ” or “Messiah” here. Alternate translation: [the Christ will be called]
3:intro	a6h3				0	# Matthew 3 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. The birth of Jesus Christ and the beginning of his ministry ([1:1–4:25](../01/01.md))\n      * The ministry of John the Baptist ([3:1–12](../03/01.md))\n      * John baptizes Jesus ([3:13–17](../03/13.md))\n\nSome translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this with the quotation from the Old Testament in [verse 3](../03/03.md).\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### John the Baptist\n\nIn this chapter, Matthew introduces John the Baptist, who preached in the wilderness. Matthew describes his clothing and his food in ways that resemble the prophet Elijah. John preached a message that called for repentance. He prepared the way for Jesus to begin his ministry.\n\n### Baptism\n\nThe word “baptism” refers to a ritual washing, usually with water. John’s baptism is similar to Christian baptism, but it does not mean exactly the same thing (see [Acts 18:24–26](../../act/18/24.md)). John says that his baptism is “for repentance” (see [3:11](../03/11.md)). Most likely, it symbolized the removal of the sins that people were repenting of and the beginning of a new way of living. However, even Jesus received this baptism despite the fact that he did not need to repent of any sins. In this case, the baptism may symbolize complete dedication to God. Consider how you might refer to this kind of ritual washing in your language.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Fruit tree metaphor\n\nIn [3:8](../03/08.md) and [3:10](../03/10.md), John speaks of people as if they were fruit trees. He says that people need to produce “good fruit,” just like fruit trees should. However, every fruit tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and burned. In the same way, people who do not do what is right will be judged and punished. If possible, preserve this metaphor or express it in simile form.\n\n### Wheat harvest metaphor\n\nIn [3:12](../03/12.md), John speaks of people as if they were parts of wheat plants. People who obey God are like the edible part of the wheat plant, the grain. People who disobey God are like the inedible part of the wheat plant, the chaff. Just as a farmer separates the grain from the chaff, so God will separate people into those who obey him and those who do not. Then, just as the farmer stores the grain and burns the chaff, so God will save those who obey him and punish those who do not. If possible, preserve this metaphor or express it in simile form.\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMany of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in speeches that John the Baptist delivers to groups of people. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are plural. You should assume forms of “you” are plural unless a note specifies that the form is singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
3:1	xp3z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	δὲ	1	Here, the word **Now** introduces the next major event in the story. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the next event, or you could leave **Now** untranslated. Alternate translation: [Next,]
3:1	yoaf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν & ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις	1	Here, Matthew uses the term **days** to refer to a particular period of time.

3:1	tmu9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ταῖς ἡμέραις ἐκείναις	1	Here, the phrase **those days** refers to the period of time before Jesus began his public ministry. During this time, Jesus lived in Nazareth with his family. Matthew is not referring to the period of time in which Joseph, Mary, and Jesus traveled back from Egypt to Galilee. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer more explicitly to the time period in which Jesus lived in Nazareth. Alternate translation: [the days when Jesus lived in Nazareth] or [the days before Jesus began his ministry]
3:1	ifa0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	παραγίνεται Ἰωάννης ὁ Βαπτιστὴς	1	This phrase introduces a new character into the story.

Alternate translation: [there is a man named John the Baptist] or [a man called John the Baptist appears]
3:1	bcdv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	παραγίνεται	1	To call attention to a development in the story, Matthew uses the present tense in past narration. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: [came]

3:2	u2pi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	μετανοεῖτε, ἤγγικεν γὰρ ἡ Βασιλεία τῶν Οὐρανῶν	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these clauses, since the second clause gives the reason for the command in the first clause. Alternate translation: [The kingdom of the heavens is near, so repent]
3:2	dweb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἡ Βασιλεία τῶν Οὐρανῶν	1	John the Baptist is referring to God’s **kingdom** that currently exists in **the heavens**. A **kingdom** is a situation in which a king rules over his people in a specific area. See the book introduction for more information about **the kingdom of the heavens**. Consider how you might express this idea here and throughout the rest of Matthew. Alternate translation: [God’s complete reign] or [the ability to be fully God’s people]
3:2	hvx8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἤγγικεν	1	Matthew uses this phrase in the sense of **near** in time. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [is about to begin] or [is about to happen]
3:3	et5g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γάρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a further explanation of what Matthew has said about John the Baptist. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an explanation, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: [In fact,] or [Now]
3:3	fl4v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὁ ῥηθεὶς	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [the one about whom the Lord spoke]
3:3	qt02		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	λέγοντος	1	In Matthew’s culture, **saying** was a normal way to introduce a quotation from an important text, in this case, the Old Testament book written by Isaiah the prophet (see [Isaiah 40:3](../../isa/40/03.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase that indicates that Matthew is quoting from an important text. Alternate translation: [who wrote in his book] or [who declared]
3:3	s62r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	φωνὴ βοῶντος	1	Isaiah is using **voice** to represent a person speaking.

If you do, you will need to delete the single quotation mark at the end of this quotation. Alternate translation: [the wilderness that people must make ready the way of the Lord, that they must make his paths straight]
3:3	n7lh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ἑτοιμάσατε τὴν ὁδὸν Κυρίου; εὐθείας ποιεῖτε τὰς τρίβους αὐτοῦ	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a connecting word in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: [Make ready the way of the Lord; yes, make his paths straight]
3:3	j99i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἑτοιμάσατε τὴν ὁδὸν Κυρίου; εὐθείας ποιεῖτε τὰς τρίβους αὐτοῦ	1	Here Isaiah speaks as if people should build and maintain roads for **the Lord** to travel on as he comes to visit his people. He means that people need to be living and acting in the proper ways when **the Lord** appears to his people.

Alternate translation: [Live and behave in a way that pleases God, as if you were making a road ready for him to travel on]
3:4	j647		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	αὐτὸς δὲ ὁ Ἰωάννης	1	Matthew uses the word **Now** to introduce background information that will help readers understand what happens next. The word does not introduce another event in the story. This background information is found in [3:4–6](../03/04.md). Use a natural form in your language for introducing background information. Alternate translation: [Concerning this John, he]
3:4	su9d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	εἶχεν τὸ ἔνδυμα αὐτοῦ ἀπὸ τριχῶν καμήλου	1	The phrase **had his clothing from the hair of a camel** means that he wore clothes made from camels’ hair.

3:5	ncp6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-simultaneous	τότε	1	Here, the word **Then** refers to the period of time in which John was preaching in the wilderness (see [3:1](../03/01.md)).

3:7	c4cl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τίς ὑπέδειξεν ὑμῖν φυγεῖν ἀπὸ τῆς μελλούσης ὀργῆς?	1	John is using the question form to rebuke the Pharisees and Sadducees for coming to be baptized by him when they really do not believe that they need to **flee from the coming wrath**. In other words, they want to be baptized, but they do not think that they need to repent of anything. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: [I realize that you do not really think that you need to flee from the coming wrath!] or [You do not actually believe that you must flee from the coming wrath.]

Every person who does not repent and do what is right is like a **tree** that does not produce **good fruit**. Just as someone chops down these trees and burns them, so God will punish these people. If possible preserve the metaphor here. You could use simile form, or if necessary, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [already it is as if the ax is set against the root of the trees. Every person who does not repent and obey is like a tree that does not produce good fruit. It is chopped down and thrown into a fire] or [already God is ready to judge people. So, anyone who does not repent and obey will be declared guilty and punished]

Just as that farmer separates the grain from the chaff, so the one who comes after John will separate those who obey from those who do not. Just as that farmer saves the grain and burns up the chaff, so the one who comes after John will save those who obey and punish those who do not. If possible, preserve this metaphor. If necessary, you could use simile form or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [who is like a farmer with a winnowing fork in his hand.

3:12	b5m4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὸ πτύον	1	A **winnowing fork** is a tool for tossing wheat into the air to separate the wheat grain from the chaff. The heavier grain falls back down, and the wind blows away the unwanted chaff. This tool is similar to a pitchfork. If you have a similar tool in your culture, you can use the word for it here. Otherwise, you can use a phrase that would express the meaning. Alternate translation: [tool for winnowing grain] or [tool for tossing seeds]
3:12	r2ua		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τὴν ἅλωνα αὐτοῦ	1	The **threshing floor** was the place where harvested wheat was processed to separate the grain from the chaff.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer to where **threshing** happens in your culture, or you could use a descriptive phrase. Alternate translation: [the place where he separates the grain from the chaff]
3:13	vl93		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	τότε	1	Here, the word **Then** introduces the next major event in the story.

4:intro	hgw2				0	# Matthew 4 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n1. The birth of Jesus Christ and the beginning of his ministry ([1:1–4:25](../01/01.md))\n      * The devil tempts Jesus ([4:1–11](../04/01.md))\n      * Jesus begins his public ministry ([4:12–17](../04/12.md))\n      * Jesus calls four of his disciples ([4:18–22](../04/18.md))\n      * Summary of Jesus’ early ministry ([4:23–25](../04/23.md))\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [4:15–16](../04/15.md), which are words from the Old Testament.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### The Devil\n\nThe devil, also named Satan, is an evil spiritual being. In this chapter, he tempts Jesus to disobey God. He even quotes the Bible to try to convince Jesus to disobey. Consider how you might naturally refer to a powerful and evil spiritual being.\n\n### Temptation\n\nIn [4:1–11](../04/01.md), Matthew tells the story of how Jesus was tempted by the devil. The devil tried to convince Jesus to do things that would be disobedient. Jesus already knew how he was supposed to live his life and how he was supposed to die on the cross. The devil tempted Jesus to act in a different way. In response, Jesus quotes the Bible and does not do what the devil tempts him to do.\n\n### Fishermen\n\nFour of Jesus’ first disciples (Peter, Andrew, James, and John) were fishermen. In their culture, fishermen usually stood on the shore or in a boat and threw a net into the water. The edges of the net had weights on it, so the net sank into the water and trapped any fish beneath it. Then, fishermen would pull on a rope to close the net and haul it to shore or onto the boat. If people in your culture do not fish or do not fish in that way, consider how much information you need to provide to help your readers understand the story.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMost of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in dialogue between Jesus and the devil. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are singular. You should assume forms of “you” are singular unless a note specifies that the form is plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])

5:intro	awz8				0	# Matthew 5 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n2. Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount ([5:1–7:28](../05/01.md))\n      * The Beatitudes ([5:1–12](../05/01.md))\n      * Salt and light ([5:13–16](../05/13.md))\n      * The law and righteousness ([5:17–20](../05/17.md))\n      * Moses’ law and Jesus’ commands ([5:21–48](../05/21.md))\n        * Murder and anger ([5:21–26](../05/21.md))\n        * Adultery and divorce ([5:27–32](../05/27.md))\n        * Oaths and promises ([5:33–37](../05/33.md))\n        * Punishment and retaliation ([5:38–42](../05/38.md))\n        * Loving everyone ([5:43–48](../05/43.md))\n\nMany people call the words in Matthew 5–7 “the Sermon on the Mount.” This is one long lesson that Jesus taught. Bibles divide this lesson into three chapters, but this can sometimes confuse the reader. If your translation divides the text into sections, be sure that the reader understands that the whole sermon is one large section.\n\nMatthew [5:3–10](../05/03.md), known as the Beatitudes, or the Blessings, has been set farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. This way of placing the words on the page highlights the poetic form of this section.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### The “Beatitudes”\n\nIn [5:3–12](../05/03.md), Jesus speaks nine blessings, or “Beatitudes.” He uses poetic form, repetition, and contrasting statements. Use forms in your language that people would recognize as poetry. See the notes on these verses for translation options.\n\n### “You have heard that it was said”\n\nWhen Jesus quotes commands that his audience would be familiar with, he uses a phrase like “you have heard that it was said.” Usually when he uses this phrase, he is quoting or summarizing commands directly from the Old Testament law. However, in [5:43](../05/43.md), he quotes a command from the Old Testament (“love your neighbor”) and then includes what some people would add to that command (“hate your enemy”). You may need to clarify that only the clause “love your neighbor” is from the Old Testament law. See the notes on each verse for information about what commands Jesus is quoting or summarizing.\n\n### Jesus and the law\n\nThroughout this chapter, Jesus quotes commands that his audience would be familiar with. Then he introduces his response to these commands with a phrase like “but I say to you.” In each case, Jesus is not contradicting or annulling the commands from God that he quotes. Instead, Jesus is correcting misunderstandings about what these commands mean. He wants his disciples to apply the commands properly. Use a form that indicates that Jesus is clarifying the commands, not contradicting them.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Salt metaphor\n\nIn [5:13](../05/13.md), Jesus describes his disciples as if they were salt that seasons the world. He means that, just as salt preserves food and makes it taste better, so his disciples help save people in the world and make the world a better place. If possible, preserve the metaphor or express the idea in simile form. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Light metaphor\n\nIn [5:14–16](../05/14.md), Jesus describes his disciples as if they together were a lamp that gives light. He means specifically that their good deeds function together like a light that shines on other people, which allows these people to learn what is true and to praise God. If possible, preserve the metaphor or express the idea in simile form. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Hyperbole\n\nIn [5:29–30](../05/29.md), Jesus commands his disciples to cut off body parts that cause them to sin. He uses this extreme example of resisting sin in order to show his disciples how serious sin really is. He does not mean that believers should always cut off body parts when they sin. Jesus intends his commands to be shocking, however, so you should preserve the extreme language. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that indicates that Jesus’ commands are extreme language.\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nIn this chapter, Jesus is talking to a large crowd of his followers. Throughout the chapter, Jesus switches between using you in the singular and you in the plural while he is talking to the same people. When he uses the singular, he is speaking about specific situations that each person in the crowd might experience. When he uses the plural, he is speaking generally to the crowd as a whole. You should assume that Jesus is using plural forms of “you” unless a note specifies that the forms are singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]] and [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-crowd]])

5:26	l1xl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐ μὴ	1	The words translated as **certainly not** are two negative words. In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative.

So instead you might use the name of the least valuable coin in your culture, or a general expression. Alternate translation: [the last penny] or [every bit of money that your creditor demands]
5:27	jxg5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐρρέθη	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

5:28	o6w7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐγὼ & λέγω ὑμῖν, ὅτι	1	Jesus uses the clause **I say to you** to emphasize what he is about to say and to contrast it with the command he quoted in the previous verse ([5:27](../05/27.md)).

5:28	z70s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἤδη ἐμοίχευσεν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **adultery**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [has already become an adulterer] or [has already done what is adulterous]
5:28	glg9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν τῇ καρδίᾳ αὐτοῦ	1	In Matthew’s culture, the **heart** is the place where humans think and feel.

5:29	v6jr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ἔξελε αὐτὸν καὶ βάλε ἀπὸ σοῦ	1	Here Jesus provides the most extreme response to sinning.

If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: [Even the tax collectors do the same.] or [Even tax collectors do that very thing!]
5:47	qpvk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς ὑμῶν	1	Jesus is using the term **brothers** to mean people who share the same faith. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [fellow disciples] or [other believers]
5:47	ebw3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τοὺς ἀδελφοὺς	1	Although the term **brothers** is masculine, Jesus is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If you retain the metaphor in your translation, and if it would be helpful in your language, you could say “brothers and sisters” to indicate this.
5:47	ba6e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	τί περισσὸν ποιεῖτε?	1	Jesus uses this question to show that people who **greet** only their **brothers** do not do anything **more**.

Alternate translation: [you do nothing more.] or [you have not done anything more!]
5:47	ah5w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	περισσὸν	1	Here Jesus implies that they are not doing anything **more** than people who do not know God do. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [more than anyone else] or [more than people who do not know God]

Alternate translation: [Even the Gentiles do the same thing.] or [Even Gentiles do that very thing!]
5:47	hayf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	οἱ ἐθνικοὶ	1	Many ancient manuscripts read **the Gentiles**. The ULT follows that reading.

If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
5:48	x9xh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1	Here, the word **Therefore** introduces the conclusion to what Jesus has been telling his disciples about how to live. He could be concluding everything he said in [5:21–47](../05/21.md), or he could be concluding only what he said in [5:43–47](../05/43.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a conclusion. Alternate translation: [So then] or [In summary]
5:48	l6pa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	Πατὴρ ὑμῶν ὁ οὐράνιος	1	This is a figurative expression. God is not the **Father** of humans in the same actual way that he is the Father of Jesus. Even so, it would probably be best to translate **Father** with the same word that your language would naturally use to refer to a human father. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that this means God. Alternate translation: [God your heavenly Father]
6:intro	jrj2				0	# Matthew 6 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n2. Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount ([5:1–7:28](../05/01.md))\n      * Giving alms ([6:1–4](../06/01.md))\n      * Praying to God ([6:5–15](../06/05.md))\n      * Fasting ([6:16–18](../06/16.md))\n      * Storing up treasure ([6:19–21](../06/19.md))\n      * The eye and the body ([6:22–23](../06/22.md))\n      * Two masters ([6:24](../06/24.md))\n      * Being anxious ([6:25–34](../06/25.md))\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the prayer in [6:9–13](../06/09.md).\n\nJesus spoke about many different subjects in this sermon, so you may wish to help the reader by putting an empty line into the text whenever Jesus changed the subject.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Giving alms\n\nGiving alms was an important practice for religious people in Jesus’ culture. To give alms, a person would offer money or possessions to other people who were poor or in need. Sometimes they would give the money or possessions directly to poor people. Other times, they would give it to the priests, who would give to poor people. Make sure that your translation refers to this kind of practice.\n\n### “The Lord’s Prayer”\n\nIn [6:9–13](../06/09.md), Jesus speaks a prayer that he wants his disciples to imitate when they pray. The prayer is very poetic, and it is sometimes called “the Lord’s Prayer.” Many churches use this prayer during their meetings, and the form that churches use is often not the same form that Matthew wrote down. If churches already use a form of this prayer in your language, you could use the same words. However, you should follow the form of the prayer as Mathew wrote it down, and you should not include any extra lines or pieces of the prayer beyond what Matthew included.\n\n### Fasting\n\nIn [6:16–18](../06/16.md), Jesus gives instructions related to fasting. Just as with giving alms, fasting was an important practice for religious people in Jesus’ culture. Fasting usually required avoiding all food and drink, but some kinds of fasting only required avoiding certain kinds of food. Also, some fasts were public (that is, many people fasted on these set days) and some fasts were private (that is, individuals would choose to fast for certain reasons). Many fasts lasted part of a day or a full day. Jesus does not condemn fasting; instead, he gives instructions for how to behave while fasting. Make sure that your translation refers to these kinds of practices.\n\n### Storing up treasures\n\nIn [6:19–21](../06/19.md), Jesus speaks about storing up treasures either on earth or in heaven. He is speaking not only of possessions or money but also of anything that one considers to be valuable. Jesus points out that valuable things in heaven cannot be ruined like valuable things on earth can. Also, he states that a person’s “heart” is where they store their treasures. If possible, use a word for “treasure” that can refer to money, possessions, and any other valuable things.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### The lamp and light metaphor in [6:22–23](../06/22.md)\n\nIn these verses, Jesus speaks about eyes as if they were lamps for the body. This figure of speech has two pieces to it. First, Jesus speaks of how bodies work using the metaphor of lamps and light. Second, Jesus speaks of Christian living using the metaphor of how bodies work. It is important to consider both of these pieces as you translate these verses.\n\nFirst, Jesus speaks of how bodies work using the metaphor of lamps and light. There are two major options for understanding what Jesus means when he refers to an eye as the lamp of the body. First, in Matthew’s culture, some people thought that eyes worked by sending out a form of light that would shine on what they saw. In this case, eyes are like lamps because they have light inside them that shines out. So, the whole body is light or dark inside based on whether the eyes shine properly. Second, the eyes could be like windows that let light into the body. Since they let light into a place, they are like lamps. So, the whole body is light or dark inside based on whether the eyes let light in. Consider how you might best express one of these meanings while maintaining the light and dark language, which is very important for understanding the figure of speech.\n\nSecond, Jesus speaks of Christian life using the metaphor of how bodies work. Scholars debate what Jesus means when he talks about a “healthy eye” and “light” in contrast to an “evil eye” and “darkness.” He might mean devotion to God in contrast to evil desires. He might mean generosity in contrast to greed and selfishness. He might mean paying attention to what he is saying in contrast to ignoring his instructions. Since Jesus most likely intended this figure of speech to be like a riddle or puzzle, you should retain the body metaphor. If necessary, you could indicate that this is a figure of speech without stating exactly what it means.\n\n### Rhetorical questions\n\nIn [6:25–28](../06/25.md) and [6:30](../06/30.md), Jesus uses rhetorical questions. He asks these questions to include the disciples in what he is arguing, not because he is looking for information. If your language does not use questions in this way, you could include answers to the questions or you could express them as statements or exclamations. See the notes on these verses for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nIn this chapter, Jesus is talking to a large crowd of his followers. Throughout the chapter, Jesus switches between using “you” in the singular and “you” in the plural while he is talking to the same people. When he uses the singular, he is speaking about specific situations that each person in the crowd might experience. When he uses the plural, he is speaking generally to the crowd as a whole. You should assume that Jesus is using plural forms of “you” unless a note specifies that the forms are singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])

6:2	g834		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	μὴ σαλπίσῃς ἔμπροσθέν σου	1	Here Jesus could be referring to: (1) how people actually had someone with a **trumpet** announce that they were giving **alms**.

6:17	c20j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd	σὺ & σου & σου	1	Even though Jesus is speaking to many disciples, he is addressing an individual situation, so **you** and **your** are singular throughout this verse.

Alternate translation: [by your Father, whom no one can see]; (3) the disciple should fast **in secret**. Alternate translation: [in secret by your Father]
6:18	m56a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τῷ Πατρί σου & ὁ Πατήρ σου	1	This is a figurative expression.

7:intro	bz7e				0	# Matthew 7 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n2. Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount ([5:1–7:28](../05/01.md))\n      * Making judgments ([7:1–6](../07/01.md))\n      * Asking and receiving ([7:7–12](../07/07.md))\n      * Narrow and wide gates ([7:13–14](../07/13.md))\n      * Obeying God is what matters ([7:15–27](../07/15.md))\n        * Fruits metaphor ([7:15–20](../07/15.md))\n        * Judgment day ([7:21–23](../07/21.md))\n        * House metaphor ([7:24–27](../07/24.md))\n      * The people are amazed ([7:28–29](../07/28.md))\n\nJesus spoke about many different subjects in this sermon, so you may wish to help the reader by putting an empty line into the text whenever Jesus changed the subject.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Judging\n\nIn [7:1–6](../07/01.md), Jesus warns his disciples about judging others. More specifically, he warns them against mentioning or dealing with someone else’s fault or sin when they themselves have an even more significant fault or sin. Jesus does want his disciples to make choices and decisions about other people, as [7:6](../07/06.md) makes clear. That verse requires people to be careful what they do with holy and valuable things. However, the general message is to avoid making judgments about others, especially when one has one’s own faults and sins.\n\n### Words and deeds\n\nIn [7:15–27](../07/15.md), Jesus teaches about the importance of doing what is right, not just saying the right things. He says that his disciples can recognize false prophets by what they do, that he himself will honor and acknowledge his disciples based on what they do, and that only those who do what is right will survive difficult experiences.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### The speck of wood and the log\n\nIn [7:3–5](../07/03.md), Jesus refers to small faults and sins as if they were specks of wood in people’s eyes. He refers to larger faults and sins as if they were logs in people’s eyes. Jesus speaks in this way to contrast how significant these sins and faults are. He also speaks in this way to indicate that larger sins and faults make people spiritually unobservant, just as a log in someone’s eye makes that person unable to see. If possible preserve the metaphor or express the idea in simile form. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Dogs and pigs\n\nIn [7:6](../07/06.md), Jesus speaks of how his disciples should behave as if they were interacting with holy things, pearls, dogs, and pigs. He could be speaking of the gospel as the holy and pearls. In this case, the dogs and pigs represent people who reject the gospel. Or, Jesus could be speaking of his disciples’ possessions and skills as the holy and pearls. In this case, the dogs and pigs represent worthless tasks and goals. Or, Jesus could be speaking of fellow disciples as the holy and pearls. In this case, the dogs and pigs represent unbelievers. Since Jesus speaks these words as a saying or proverb, you should avoid choosing one option. Instead, you should express the idea in a way that allows for all these and other interpretations. If if it would be helpful to your readers, you could use a form that you would normally use for a proverb or saying. See the notes on this verse for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Gates and roads\n\nIn [7:13–14](../07/13.md), Jesus speaks of how people live as if they were traveling on a road or passing through a gate. He says that the gate and road that lead to eternal life are narrow and difficult, and only a few people travel that way. On the other hand, the gate and road that lead to destruction are wide and easy, and many people travel that way. He means that it is very easy to live in ways that will end in destruction, and it is hard to live in ways that will end in eternal life. If possible preserve the metaphor or express the idea in simile form. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Trees and fruits\n\nIn [7:16–20](../07/16.md), Jesus speaks of people as if they were plants. Just as you can tell what kind of plant it is by what fruit the plant produces, so you can tell whether people are really Jesus’ disciples based on what they do. If possible preserve the metaphor or express the idea in simile form. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Building houses\n\nIn [7:24–27](../07/24.md), Jesus compares obedient people to wise people who build their homes on a solid foundation. When bad things happen, they will be safe and secure, just like those homes will be safe and secure through storms and floods. In contrast, Jesus compares disobedient people to foolish people who build their homes on an insecure foundation. When bad things happen, they will be destroyed, just like those homes will collapse when storms and floods come. If possible preserve the metaphor or express the idea in simile form. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nIn this chapter, Jesus is talking to a large crowd of his followers. Throughout the chapter, Jesus switches between using “you” in the singular and “you” in the plural while he is talking to the same people. When he uses the singular, he is speaking about specific situations that each person in the crowd might experience. When he uses the plural, he is speaking generally to the crowd as a whole. You should assume that Jesus is using plural forms of “you” unless a note specifies that the forms are singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])

7:3	ctb3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	βλέπεις τὸ κάρφος τὸ ἐν τῷ ὀφθαλμῷ τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου, τὴν δὲ ἐν τῷ σῷ ὀφθαλμῷ δοκὸν οὐ κατανοεῖς	1	Here Jesus refers to small faults and mistakes as if they were a **speck of wood** in a person’s **eye**. He speaks of large faults and mistakes as if they were a **log** in a person’s **eye**.

Alternate translation: [do you focus on your brother’s small fault, which is like a speck of wood in his eye, but you do not notice your own large fault, which is like a log in your eye] or [do you look at the small mistakes your brother makes, but you do not notice your own large mistakes]

7:3	d2qc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου	1	Jesus is using the term **brother** to mean a person who shares the same faith. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [of your fellow disciple]
7:3	mo6n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ σου	1	Although the term **brother** is masculine, Jesus is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women.

7:3	xdcg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	τὴν & δοκὸν	1	A **log** could not literally go into a person’s **eye**.

This was a poetic form in his culture. If your readers would not recognize this as poetry and misunderstand which animals Jesus is speaking about in the last two clauses, you could rearrange the clauses. Alternate translation: [You should not give the holy to the dogs. Otherwise, having turned, they will tear you to pieces. Nor should you throw your pearls in front of the pigs.

See the chapter introduction for some possible interpretations of this figure of speech. You should express the idea in a way that allows for many interpretations. If it is necessary for you to indicate that Jesus is using a figure of speech here, you could introduce the verse with a form that usually introduces a saying or proverb. Alternate translation: [Think about what this means for your life: You should neither give the holy to the dogs, nor should you throw your pearls in front of the pigs.

If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might think that what Jesus is saying is uncertain, then you could translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: [since]
7:11	n98d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	πονηροὶ ὄντες	1	Here, the phrase **being evil** states something that is unexpected of people who **know how to give good gifts**.

7:11	z8zr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὁ Πατὴρ ὑμῶν	1	This is a figurative expression. God is not the **Father** of humans in the same actual way that he is the Father of Jesus. Even so, it would probably be best to translate **Father** with the same word that your language would naturally use to refer to a human father. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that this means God. Alternate translation: [your Father, God,]
7:11	t3p4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ ἐν τοῖς οὐρανοῖς	1	Here, the phrase **in the heavens** identifies the location in which God the Father is specially present and from which he rules.

7:12	g8c7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	οἱ ἄνθρωποι	1	Although the term **men** is masculine, Jesus is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women.

7:12	cywd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γάρ	1	Here, the word **for** introduces a reason for the command that Jesus has just given.

7:12	y4f6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὗτος & ἐστιν ὁ νόμος καὶ οἱ προφῆται	1	Here, the clause **this is the Law and the Prophets** means that Jesus’ command summarizes what **the Law and the Prophets** require.

7:12	b1x2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	οἱ προφῆται	1	Here, the word **Prophets** represents what the prophets said and wrote.

7:13	dgr2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	εἰσέλθατε διὰ τῆς στενῆς πύλης; ὅτι πλατεῖα ἡ πύλη καὶ εὐρύχωρος ἡ ὁδὸς ἡ ἀπάγουσα εἰς τὴν ἀπώλειαν, καὶ πολλοί εἰσιν οἱ εἰσερχόμενοι δι’ αὐτῆς	1	Here Jesus speaks of how people live as if they were walking on a **road** and of what happens when they die as if it were entering through a **gate**. When a **gate** is **narrow**, that means that it is difficult to go through and that not many people go through it. When a **gate** is **wide** and a **road** is **broad**, that means that they are easy to travel on or go through and that many people travel on or through them. Since these are important images that Jesus uses in the following verse as well, you should preserve the figure of speech or express the idea in simile form. Alternate translation: [You should live like a traveler who enters through a narrow gate. Many people live like travelers who enter through a wide gate and travel on a broad road, but this path leads to destruction]
7:13	g4be		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ὅτι	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a reason why people should enter through the **narrow gate**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a reason for a command, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: [That is because]
7:13	zv24		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εἰς τὴν ἀπώλειαν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **destruction**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [to being destroyed] or [to God destroying you]
7:13	mulg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	πολλοί	1	Jesus is using the adjective **many** as a noun to mean many people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: [many travelers]

Alternate translation: [Enter through the narrow gate. For the gate {is} narrow and the way has been made narrow that is leading to life, and there are few finding it. But wide {is} the gate and broad {is} the road that is leading to destruction, and there are many entering through it]
7:14	aj95		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	ὅτι στενὴ ἡ πύλη καὶ τεθλιμμένη ἡ ὁδὸς	1	Many ancient manuscripts read **For the gate is narrow and the road has been made narrow**. The ULT follows that reading. Other ancient manuscripts read “How narrow is the gate and having been made narrow the road.” If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
7:14	mvfv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ὅτι	1	Here, the word **For** introduces another reason why people should enter through the narrow **gate**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a reason for a command, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: [Enter through the narrow gate because]
7:14	krug		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor	στενὴ ἡ πύλη καὶ τεθλιμμένη ἡ ὁδὸς ἡ ἀπάγουσα εἰς τὴν ζωήν, καὶ ὀλίγοι εἰσὶν οἱ εὑρίσκοντες αὐτήν	1	Here Jesus continues to speak of how people live as if they were walking on a **way** and of what happens when they die as if it were entering through a **gate**. When a **gate** is **narrow** and a **way** has been made **narrow**, that means that they are difficult to go through and that not many people go through them. Express the idea as you did in [7:13](../07/13.md). Alternate translation: [only a few people live like travelers who find the narrow gate and travel on the road that has been made narrow, and this road leads to life]
7:14	jish		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	τεθλιμμένη ἡ ὁδὸς	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

7:14	gdji		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ὀλίγοι	1	Jesus is using the adjective **few** as a noun to mean few people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: [few travelers]

By the **false prophets** wearing **sheep’s clothing**, he means that the **false prophets** pretend to be part of God’s people. However, Jesus says that **inwardly** they are **ravenous wolves**. He means that they hurt and take advantage of God’s people, which is acting just like **wolves** that eat **sheep**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in simile form or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [who pretend to be part of your group, as if they were dressed in sheep’s clothing. However, inwardly they want to harm you, as if they were ravenous wolves]

Just as thorny plants do not produce **fruits**, so evil people who do not trust God do not do what is right. Jesus uses this metaphor for several verses, so you should preserve the figure of speech or use simile form. Alternate translation: [You will know who people are by what they do, just as you know what plants are by their fruits. They do not gather grapes from a thornbush or figs from thistles, do they? Similarly, evil people do not do what is right, do they]
7:16	jvxv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἀπὸ τῶν καρπῶν αὐτῶν ἐπιγνώσεσθε αὐτούς	1	The pronouns **their** and **them** refer to any people, but particularly people like the “false prophets” Jesus mentioned in the previous verse.

7:16	vqnd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τριβόλων	1	Here, the word **thistles** refers generally to plants that have points or spikes on their stems or leaves. These plants do not produce fruit. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of plant, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term.

Just as a **good tree** produces **good fruits**, so people who follow God do what is right. Just as a **rotten tree** produces **rotten fruits**, so people who do not follow God do what is wrong. Jesus uses this metaphor for several verses, so you should preserve the figure of speech or use simile form. Alternate translation: [In the same way, every good tree produces good fruits, but the rotten tree produces bad fruits. Similarly, believers do what is right, but unbelievers do what is wrong]
7:17	vy6i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	τὸ & σαπρὸν δένδρον & ποιεῖ	1	The phrase **the rotten tree** represents rotten trees in general, not one particular rotten tree.

8:intro	f33a				0	# Matthew 8 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n3. Jesus illustrates the kingdom of God through acts of healing ([8:1–9:34](../08/01.md))\n      * Healing a leper ([8:1–4](../08/01.md))\n      * Healing the centurion’s servant ([8:5–13](../08/05.md))\n      * Healing Peter’s mother-in-law and many others ([8:14–17](../08/14.md))\n      * The cost of following Jesus ([8:18–22](../08/18.md))\n      * Calming the storm ([8:23–27](../08/23.md))\n      * Casting demons out of two men ([8:28–34](../08/28.md))\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Healings\n\nIn this chapter, Matthew narrates how Jesus heals a leper, the paralyzed servant of a centurion, Peter’s mother who had a fever, and many other people who were sick. In every case where Matthew describes what happened, Jesus speaks words, or he touches the sick person, or he does both. These stories show how powerful Jesus is. He does not need to use medicine or magic to heal people. Instead, he can just command the sickness to go away or simply touch the person.\n\n### Casting out demons\n\nMatthew clearly distinguishes sick people from people who are controlled by demons. Demons are evil spiritual beings who can control people. They usually use these people to hurt themselves or others. Matthew briefly mentions that Jesus drives demons out of people in [8:16](../08/16.md). At the end of the chapter, he includes a longer story about how Jesus drives demons out of two men ([8:28–34](../08/28.md)). The demons use the two men to speak, but they say what the demons want them to say. The demons know that Jesus is the Son of God, and they plead with Jesus not to punish them too much. Jesus agrees to do what they ask, but he is the one who is in charge. Again, the story shows how powerful Jesus is.\n\n### Feasting in the kingdom of heaven\n\nIn [8:11–12](../08/11.md), Jesus speaks about how many people will feast with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of the heavens. However, some people who are expected to be part of the feast will be cast outside and punished. It is likely that Jesus is referring to a feast that will eventually happen, so do not express the idea as if it were a metaphor.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Rhetorical Questions\n\nIn [8:26](../08/26.md) and [8:29](../08/29.md), characters in the story use rhetorical questions. They ask these questions to make strong points, not because they are looking for information. If your language does not use questions in this way, you could include answers to the questions or you could express them as statements or exclamations. See the notes on these verses for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMost of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in dialogue between Jesus and other people. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are singular. You should assume forms of “you” are singular unless a note specifies that the form is plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])

9:intro	tg41				0	# Matthew 9 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n3. Jesus illustrates the kingdom of God through acts of healing ([8:1–9:34](../08/01.md))\n      * Healing a paralytic ([9:1–8](../09/01.md))\n      * Calling Matthew and eating with sinners ([9:9–13](../09/09.md))\n      * Jesus brings something new ([9:14–17](../09/14.md))\n      * Healing a woman and resurrecting a girl ([9:18–26](../09/18.md))\n      * Healing two blind men ([9:27–31](../09/27.md))\n      * Casting a demon out of a mute man ([9:32–34](../09/32.md))\n4. Jesus teaches about mission and the kingdom ([9:35–10:42](../09/01.md))\n      * More laborers for the harvest ([9:35–38](../09/35.md))\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Healings\n\nIn this chapter, Matthew narrates how Jesus heals a paralyzed man, a woman with a disease that caused bleeding, two blind men, and many other people who were sick. In every case where Matthew describes what happened, Jesus speaks words, or he touches the sick person, or he does both. These stories show how powerful Jesus is. He does not need to use medicine or magic to heal people. Instead, he can just command the sickness to go away or simply touch the person.\n\n### Casting out demons\n\nMatthew clearly distinguishes sick people from people who are controlled by demons. Demons are evil spiritual beings who can control people. They usually use these people to hurt themselves or others. In [9:32–34](../09/32.md), Matthew briefly describes how Jesus drove out a demon who caused the man it controlled to be mute, that is, unable to speak. In response, both the crowds and the Pharisees realize that Jesus is powerful.\n\n### Resurrecting the dead\n\nIn [9:18–19](../09/18.md) and [9:23–26](../09/23.md), Matthew narrates how Jesus raised a girl from the dead. While Jesus describes her as only “sleeping,” he uses this word to indicate that the girl will “wake up” from being dead. The story clearly indicates that the girl had died and that Jesus raises her from the dead by touching her.\n\n### “Sinners”\n\nWhen Matthew uses the word “sinners,” he is describing a group of people whom many Jewish religious groups would have considered to be living in ways that were improper for those who were part of God’s people. Some of these people may have committed significant sins, while others may have disagreed with many of the Jewish religious groups about how Jews could properly behave. If possible, use a word or phrase that identifies people who are not living as many religious groups think that people should live. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### The short parables in [9:15–17](../09/15.md)\n\nIn these verses, Jesus gives three short parables that describe how certain things do not go well together. Fasting does not happen during a wedding celebration. An unshrunk piece of cloth does not make a good patch for an old garment. Old wineskins do not make a good container for fresh wine that still needs to ferment. Jesus tells these parables to illustrate how his ministry and preaching do not match well with how people had previously done things. In other words, Jesus wants people to expect what he does to be new, and this may require thinking and doing many new things. You should preserve these parables, since they are not direct metaphors. If necessary, you could introduce them in such a way that your readers recognize that they are parables or illustrations. See the notes on each verse for possible translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])\n\n### The harvest metaphor\n\nIn [9:37–38](../09/37.md), Jesus speaks of people who will believe as if they were a harvest of grain, and he speaks of those who preach the gospel as the laborers who work to harvest the grain. Just as when there is a large harvest but only a few laborers, so there are many people who will believe, but only a few people who are preaching the gospel. If possible, preserve the metaphor or express the idea in simile form. See the notes on these verses for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exmetaphor]])\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMost of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in dialogue between Jesus and other people. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are singular. You should assume forms of “you” are singular unless a note specifies that the form is plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])

9:4	n4yl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ἵνα τί ἐνθυμεῖσθε πονηρὰ ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ὑμῶν?	1	Jesus is using the question form to rebuke the scribes. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation.

9:4	e936		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	ἐνθυμεῖσθε & ὑμῶν	1	Here, the words **you** and **you** are plural because Jesus is speaking to the scribes.
9:4	jpg1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	πονηρὰ	1	Jesus is using the adjective **evil** as a noun to mean evil thoughts. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: [evil thoughts]
9:4	d499		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐν ταῖς καρδίαις ὑμῶν	1	In Matthew’s culture, **hearts** are the places where humans think and feel.

If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. He could mean: (1) that saying **‘Your sins have been forgiven’** is **easier** than saying **‘Get up and walk’**. This is because it is easy to show that someone is lying when they fail to heal a paralytic, but it is not easy to show that someone is lying when they claim to forgive sins. Alternate translation: [it is easier to say, ‘Your sins have been forgiven,’ than to say, ‘Get up and walk.]; (2) that both things are equally easy to say.

Alternate translation: [I primarily desire mercy, and only then, sacrifice] or [I desire mercy much more than sacrifice]
9:13	wil7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἔλεος & καὶ οὐ θυσίαν	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **mercy** and **sacrifice**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: [people to be merciful and not to sacrifice to me]

10:intro	m5iu				0	# Matthew 10 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n4. Jesus teaches about mission and the kingdom ([9:35–10:42](../09/01.md))\n      * The 12 disciples ([10:1–4](../10/01.md))\n      * Instructions about behavior and travel ([10:5–15](../10/05.md))\n      * Teaching on persecution ([10:16–39](../10/16.md))\n        * Expecting persecution ([10:16–23](../10/16.md))\n        * Motivation to persevere ([10:24–33](../10/24.md))\n        * Purpose during persecution ([10:34–39](../10/34.md))\n        * How to treat fellow disciples ([10:40–42](../10/40.md))\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Jesus’ instructions on how to travel\n\nJesus instructs the disciples not to bring money, sandals, staff, or extra clothing with them when they travel and preach the good news. Instead, he wants the disciples to rely on the hospitality of people they visit. So, he instructs them to find someone who is “worthy” to host them, and he tells them to stay at that person’s house until they leave the area. Make sure that your translation indicates that the disciples should not pack money or extra clothing because they will be staying with people who welcome them and their message.\n\n### The coming of the Son of Man\n\nIn [10:23](../10/23.md), Jesus tells the disciples that they will not complete their work in the towns of Israel before “the Son of Man comes.” Jesus often uses the phrase “Son of Man” to refer to himself as an important representative of God. In this verse, it is not clear what it means for this important figure, Jesus himself, to “come.” Christians have understood this “coming” in several ways:\n\n1. It could describe Jesus’ second coming, but it seems like the disciples probably did finish their work in the towns of Israel before Jesus’ second coming.\n2. It could describe the time when the Romans destroyed Jerusalem, which was Jesus “coming” to judge and punish.\n3. It could describe Jesus’ ascension to be enthroned in heaven. In this case, “coming” refers going into heaven, not coming to earth.\n4.It could describe Jesus’ appearances to the disciples after his resurrection.\n\nSince Christians have understood this verse in at least these different ways, if possible, your translation should allow for all these options. See the notes on [10:23](../10/23.md) for translation options.\n\n### Persecution and conflict\n\nThroughout this chapter, Jesus speaks about the persecutions and troubles his disciples will face, even from members of their own families. He motivates them to persevere during these persecutions and troubles in several ways. First, he reminds them that people persecute him, and so they will definitely persecute his disciples. That means that persecution is a sign that the disciples are following Jesus. Second, he encourages them that God knows and cares about them and their suffering. Third, he tells them that God will show them what to say when people are accusing them. In the end, Jesus wants to teach his disciples to expect persecution, how to think about it, and how to persevere during it.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### The 12 disciples\n\nThe following are the lists of the 12 disciples in Matthew, Mark, and Luke:\n\nIn [Matthew 10:2–4](../10/02.md):\n\nSimon (Peter), Andrew, James son of Zebedee, John son of Zebedee, Philip, Bartholomew, Thomas, Matthew, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot and Judas Iscariot.\n\nIn [Mark 3:16–19](../../mrk/03/16.md):\n\nSimon (Peter), James son of Zebedee, John son of Zebedee, Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddaeus, Simon the Zealot, and Judas Iscariot.\n\nIn [Luke 6:14–16](../../luk/06/14.md):\n\nSimon (Peter), Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Simon the Zealot, Judas son of James, and Judas Iscariot.\n\nThese lists do not always follow the same order or use the same names for the disciples. In that culture, people often had two or three names. For example, it is likely that that Thaddaeus was also named Judas or Jude. So, do not harmonize these lists by using the same sequence or names in each case. You should translate Matthew’s list as Matthew presents it.\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nIn this chapter, Jesus is giving instructions to the 12 disciples. Because of that, all forms of “you” in this chapter are plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])

If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: [by no means]

10:24	l7eg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τὸν & αὐτοῦ	1	Although the term **his** is masculine, Jesus is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women.

He applies this proverb to his disciples to show them that they should be content to be like Jesus. Translate this proverb in such a way that it will be recognized as a proverb and will be meaningful in your language and culture.

10:25	a49b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	τῷ μαθητῇ & ὁ δοῦλος	1	The phrases **the disciple** and **the slave** represent any disciples or slaves, not one particular disciple or slave.

He speaks of himself as **the master of the house** and his disciples as **the members of his household**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use simile form or include the meaning of the figure of speech. Alternate translation: [I am like the master of the house, and you are like the members of my household. If they called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much worse the members of his household] or [If they called me, the master of the house, Beelzebul, how much worse you, the members of the household]
10:25	pu5y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-fact	εἰ	1	Jesus speaks as if this were a hypothetical situation, but he means that it is true. If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might think that what Jesus is saying is uncertain, then you could translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: [Given that] or [Because]
10:25	sj3w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	ἐπεκάλεσαν	1	The pronoun **they** refers to any person who called Jesus **Beelzebul**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that refers to any person who does that. Alternate translation: [some people called] or [his enemies called]
10:25	y5md		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	πόσῳ μᾶλλον	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You could supply these words from earlier in the sentence if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: [how much worse names will they call]
10:25	mhjn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	αὐτοῦ	3	Since Jesus applies this proverb in such a way that he is the **master of the house**, the word **his** refers specifically to Jesus. Jesus is not using the word generically here. Preserve the reference to a specific man. Alternate translation: [the master’s]
10:26	v8wb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτούς	1	The pronoun **them** refers to the people mentioned in the previous verse who called the master of the house and his household names. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea as you did in the previous verse. Alternate translation: [that kind of person] or [those enemies]
10:26	taoq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γάρ	1	The word **for** introduces a reason why the disciples should not **fear them**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a reason or basis for a claim, or you could leave **for** untranslated. Alternate translation: [since]
10:26	cnzb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs	οὐδὲν & ἐστιν κεκαλυμμένον ὃ οὐκ ἀποκαλυφθήσεται, καὶ κρυπτὸν ὃ οὐ γνωσθήσεται	1	Jesus uses or invents a proverb in order to teach that things that appear to be **concealed** or **hidden** will eventually be **revealed** or **made known**. Translate this proverb in such a way that it will be recognized as a proverb and be meaningful in your language and culture. Jesus could be applying this proverb: (1) to things that people do in secret to hurt or harm his disciples, things that will be made known to everyone. Alternate translation: [everything that people conceal will be revealed, and everything that people hide will be made known]; (2) to the gospel message, that was or is concealed but that will be made known to everyone. Alternate translation: [the message that is concealed will be revealed, and the message that is hidden will be made known]
10:26	x4o8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	οὐδὲν & ἐστιν κεκαλυμμένον ὃ οὐκ ἀποκαλυφθήσεται, καὶ κρυπτὸν ὃ οὐ γνωσθήσεται	1	These two clauses mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the clauses with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternatively, you could combine the two clauses into one. Alternate translation: [there is nothing concealed that will not be revealed; yes, there is nothing hidden that will not be made known] or [there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed]
10:26	xqs4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐδὲν & ἐστιν κεκαλυμμένον ὃ οὐκ ἀποκαλυφθήσεται, καὶ κρυπτὸν ὃ οὐ γνωσθήσεται	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use positive expressions to translate these double negatives that consist of the negative word **nothing**, which is implied in the second clause, and the negative particle **not**. Alternate translation: [everything that is concealed will be revealed, and everything that is hidden will be made known]
10:26	j86e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οὐδὲν & ἐστιν κεκαλυμμένον ὃ οὐκ ἀποκαλυφθήσεται, καὶ κρυπτὸν ὃ οὐ γνωσθήσεται	1	If your language does not use these passive forms, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who does the action, Jesus could be implying: (1) that people do the concealing and hiding and God does the revealing and making known. This fits with the view that the proverb refers to how people persecute the disciples. Alternate translation: [there is nothing that people conceal that God will not reveal, and there is nothing that people hide that God will not make known]; (2) that God does both the concealing and hiding and the revealing and making known. This fits with the view that the proverb refers to preaching the gospel. Alternate translation: [there is nothing that God has concealed that he will not reveal, and there is nothing that God has hidden that he will not make known]
10:27	fa1s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ὃ λέγω ὑμῖν ἐν τῇ σκοτίᾳ, εἴπατε ἐν τῷ φωτί; καὶ ὃ εἰς τὸ οὖς ἀκούετε, κηρύξατε ἐπὶ τῶν δωμάτων	1	These two clauses mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the clauses with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: [What I tell you in the darkness, say in the light. Again, what you hear in your ear, proclaim upon the housetops]
10:27	kw75		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν τῇ σκοτίᾳ	1	Jesus uses the image of **darkness** to represent the idea of concealment or secrecy. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [secretly]
10:27	rw53		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῇ σκοτίᾳ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **darkness**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [in a dark place]
10:27	kih1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἐν τῷ φωτί	1	Jesus uses the image of **light** to represent the idea of no concealment or secrecy. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [openly]
10:27	fc49		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ὃ εἰς τὸ οὖς ἀκούετε	1	The phrase **what you hear in your ear** refers to something that a person told **you** quietly.

10:27	v1b7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἐπὶ τῶν δωμάτων	1	Houses in Israel had flat roofs that were reached by stairs or ladders, so people could easily go up and stand on top of them. If houses are different in your culture and you think your readers might wonder how people would get up onto housetops and stand there, you could translate this with a general expression. Alternate translation: [from a high place from which everyone will be able to hear]
10:28	l2uy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῶν ἀποκτεννόντων	1	The phrase **the ones** refers to humans in general. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [humans, the ones killing]
10:28	c4nu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸ σῶμα, τὴν & ψυχὴν & καὶ ψυχὴν καὶ σῶμα	1	Jesus uses the words **body** and **soul** to distinguish between the physical and non-physical parts of a person. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use words that describe the physical and non-physical parts of a person, or you could use more general expressions. Alternate translation: [your physical parts … your non-physical parts … both your physical and non-physical parts]
10:28	pk7k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ μᾶλλον	1	Matthew contrasts fear of people with fear of God by using the phrase **But instead**. People are only able to kill our physical bodies, but God is **the one being able** to destroy both our physical bodies and our spiritual souls. Use a natural way in your language for introducing a contrast. Alternate translation: [But rather]
10:28	x3y1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸν δυνάμενον	1	The phrase **the one** refers to God. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [God, who is able]
10:28	w5rq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	Γεέννῃ	1	Jesus uses the name **Gehenna** to refer to hell. The valley named **Gehenna** was outside the city of Jerusalem and was a place where people threw out and burned garbage. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a simile or state the meaning plainly. See how you translated this name in [5:22](../05/22.md). Alternate translation: [a place like the valley of Gehenna] or [hell, which is like Gehenna]
10:29	tm3s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	οὐχὶ δύο στρουθία ἀσσαρίου πωλεῖται? καὶ ἓν ἐξ αὐτῶν οὐ πεσεῖται ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, ἄνευ τοῦ Πατρὸς ὑμῶν	1	Jesus applies what he says here about **sparrows** to his disciples in [10:31](../10/31.md). So, you do not need to include any implied information in this verse.
10:29	glbl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	οὐχὶ δύο στρουθία ἀσσαρίου πωλεῖται?	1	Jesus is using the question form to show the disciples how inexpensive **sparrows** are. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: [Two sparrows are sold for an assarion.] or [You know that two sparrows are sold for an assarion!]
10:29	zayd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	οὐχὶ δύο στρουθία ἀσσαρίου πωλεῖται	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [Do people not sell two sparrows for an assarion]
10:29	q22l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	στρουθία	1	The word **sparrows** refers to small, seed-eating birds. If your readers would not know what sparrows are, you could use a general expression instead. Alternate translation: [small birds]
10:29	i399		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney	ἀσσαρίου	1	An **assarion** was a small copper coin equivalent to about half an hour’s wage. You could try to express this amount in terms of current monetary values, but that might cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate since those values can change over time. So instead, you might state something more general or give the equivalent in wages. Alternate translation: [for a small copper coin] or [for half an hour’s wage]
10:29	wxt4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	ἓν ἐξ αὐτῶν οὐ πεσεῖται ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν, ἄνευ τοῦ Πατρὸς ὑμῶν	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative phrase **apart from**. Alternate translation: [each one of them falls to ground in the presence of your Father]
10:29	id3c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	πεσεῖται ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν	1	The phrase **fall to the ground** refers politely to the sparrow dying. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that politely refers to an animal dying, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [will pass away] or [will perish]
10:29	us0e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἄνευ τοῦ Πατρὸς ὑμῶν	1	The phrase **apart from your Father** could indicate that something happens: (1) without the Father’s knowledge. Alternate translation: [apart from the knowledge of your Father]; (2) without the Father’s will. Alternate translation: [apart from the will of your Father]; (3) without the Father’s care or interest. Alternate translation: [apart from the care of your Father]
10:29	fe8z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τοῦ Πατρὸς ὑμῶν	1	This is a figurative expression. God is not the **Father** of humans in the same actual way that he is the Father of Jesus. Even so, it would probably be best to translate **Father** with the same word that your language would naturally use to refer to a human father.

11:intro	puf4				0	# Matthew 11 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n5. Jesus teaches about the gospel of the kingdom of God, and opposition to Jesus begins ([11:1–12:50](../11/01.md))\n      * Jesus and John the Baptist ([11:1–19](../11/01.md))\n        * John asks about who Jesus is ([11:1–6](../11/01.md))\n        * Jesus teaches about John ([11:7–15](../11/07.md))\n        * Jesus speaks about himself and John ([11:16–19](../11/16.md))\n      * Judgment on Galilean cities ([11:20–24](../11/20.md))\n      * Jesus speaks about his ministry ([11:25–30](../11/25.md))\n\nSome translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this with the quotation from [Malachi 3:1](../../mal/03/01.md) in [11:10](../11/10.md).\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### “Elijah”\n\nIn [11:14](../11/14.md), Jesus says that John the Baptist is “Elijah, the one being about to come.” Here Jesus refers to a prophecy in [Malachi 4:5–6](../../mal/04/05.md) that indicates that God will send “Elijah” to prepare the way before God comes to judge his enemies and reward his people. Malachi is referring to a prophet who lived even earlier. This prophet, named Elijah, performed many miracles and spoke messages from God (see [1 Kings 17–19](../../1ki/17/01.md) and [2 Kings 2:1–17](../../2ki/02/01.md)). So, when Jesus says that John is “Elijah,” he means that John fulfills the prophecy in Malachi that someone like the prophet Elijah will prepare the way before God comes to judge and reward people. If your readers would not know the prophecy in Malachi or the stories about the prophet Elijah, you may need to include some of this information in your translation or in a footnote.\n\n### The day of judgment\n\nIn [11:21–24](../11/21.md), Jesus refers to “the day of judgment.” He says that, on that day, it will be more tolerable for wicked people who lived in cities like Tyre, Sidon, and Sodom than it will be for people who reject Jesus’ ministry in cities like Chorazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum. The phrase “day of judgment” refers to a specific time in the future when God will judge everyone, punish those who disobey him, and reward those who believe in and obey him. What Jesus means is that even wicked people who lived in cities like Tyre, Sidon, and Sodom will receive less punishment than people who reject him and his message. See the notes on these verses for translation options.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### The comparison with children in [11:16–19](../11/16.md)\n\nIn these verses, Jesus compares how people treat him and John with how children play in the marketplace. There are two primary ways to understand the comparison. First, Jesus and John could be like the children who play flutes or sing funeral songs. In this case, Jesus is saying that people reject both John’s mournful ministry and Jesus’ joyful ministry. Second, the people whom Jesus is speaking about could be like the children who play flutes or sing funeral songs. In this case, Jesus is saying that these people are upset that John and Jesus do not behave as they want them to behave. Since both of these options have similar meanings, and because Jesus does not clearly explain which option he intended, if possible express the comparison in such a way that either interpretation could make sense.\n\n### Jesus rebuking cities in [11:20–24](../11/20.md)\n\nIn these verses, Jesus speaks to specific cities as if they were among the crowds who were listening to him. He speaks in this way to express his attitude towards these cities. Further, when Jesus refers to the cities, he uses their names to refer to the people who live in those cities. So, when Jesus speaks directly to Chorazin, Bethsaida, and Capernaum, he is expressing his attitude toward the people who live in those cities. See the notes on these verses for translation strategies and options.\n\n### The yoke and burden metaphor in [11:28–30](../11/28.md)\n\nIn these verses, Jesus promises rest, an easy yoke, and a light burden to those who are laboring and heavy-burdened. There are several ways to understand these images. First, Jesus could be referring to how people struggle and suffer for many reasons, and he promises to make these things better. Second, Jesus could be referring to how people struggle to obey what the religious leaders say to do, and he promises to give them better and easier commands. Third, Jesus could be referring to how people suffer under the Roman empire, and he promises to be a better leader and ruler. Since Jesus is speaking to a crowd of people, most likely he used the images of yokes and burdens so that what he was saying would be relevant to all the people, no matter what they were struggling with. So, if possible preserve the figure of speech or express the idea in a general way that could refer to many different difficult or hard things.\n\n### The meaning of [11:12](../11/12.md)\n\nThis verse contains two clauses, and both clauses can be interpreted in several ways. First, there are several options for understanding the meaning of the clause “the kingdom of the heavens suffers violence”:\n\n1. The “kingdom” could be what experiences the “violence.” In this case, the violence could come from:\n      * people who hate and attack the kingdom\n      * people who want to make the kingdom stronger by using violence\n2. The “kingdom” could be what performs the “violence.” In this case, the kingdom advances or becomes stronger in forceful and powerful ways.\n\nSecond, there are also several options for understanding the meaning of the clause “violent men take it by force”:\n\n1. The “men” could be evil or wicked. In this case, they could be trying to:\n      * attack and destroy the kingdom\n      * take the kingdom away from Jesus and his disciples\n2. The “men” could be trying to do what is right. In this case, they are trying to become part of the kingdom in forceful or powerful ways.\n\nAlmost any combination of these options is possible for understanding the meaning of the verse. However, the most common interpretations are these:\n\n1. The kingdom experiences violence, and violent people attack it and try to destroy it\n2. The kingdom advances forcefully, and forceful people want to be part of it\n3. The kingdom advances forcefully, but violent people attack it and try to destroy it\n4. Violent people want to make the kingdom stronger by violence, and they try to take the kingdom away from Jesus and his disciples\n\nSee the translation notes on this verse for possible ways to express the ideas. Since there are many ways to understand the verse, if possible make your translation general enough to allow for several or all of these interpretations.\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMost of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in speeches that Jesus gives to many people around him. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are plural. You should assume forms of “you” are plural unless a note specifies that the form is singular.

11:1	dr3u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	τοῦ διδάσκειν καὶ κηρύσσειν	1	The terms **teach** and **preach** mean similar things. Matthew is using the two terms together for emphasis.

Since Matthew narrates this story in [14:4–5](../14/04.md), you do not need to explain it to your reader here. If it would be helpful in your language, you could clarify that John is **in the prison** when he hears about **the deeds of Christ**. Alternate translation: [John, who was in prison, having heard about]
11:2	zy7z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὰ ἔργα τοῦ Χριστοῦ	1	Matthew is using the possessive form to describe **deeds** that **Christ** did. If this is not clear in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: [the deeds that Christ had done]
11:2	k1a8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	πέμψας διὰ τῶν μαθητῶν αὐτοῦ	1	Matthew means that John **sent** his **disciples** to Jesus and had them speak to Jesus for him.

11:3	isix		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	σὺ	1	Since John’s disciples are talking to Jesus, the word **you** in this verse is singular.
11:3	w2im		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ ἐρχόμενος	1	John uses the phrase **the one coming** to refer to a special person whom God promised would come and help God’s people. People sometimes called this special person “the Messiah.” If it would be helpful to your readers, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: [the special person whom God said would come] or [the Messiah whom God said would come]
11:3	q89t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	ἕτερον προσδοκῶμεν	1	John is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You could supply these words from earlier in the sentence if it would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: [should we expect another person to be the coming one]
11:4	w03k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	ἀποκριθεὶς ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἶπεν	1	Together the words **answering** and **said** mean that Jesus responded to the question that John’s disciples had asked him. Consider natural ways of introducing direct quotations in your language. Alternate translation: [Jesus responded]
11:5	dyxy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τυφλοὶ ἀναβλέπουσιν, καὶ χωλοὶ περιπατοῦσιν, λεπροὶ καθαρίζονται, καὶ κωφοὶ ἀκούουσιν, καὶ νεκροὶ ἐγείρονται, καὶ πτωχοὶ εὐαγγελίζονται	1	When he answers John’s disciples, Jesus lists many things that he has done. John’s disciples would have known that this list is similar to the lists found in [Isaiah 35:5–6](../../isa/35/05.md) and [Isaiah 61:1](../../isa/61/01.md) that describe what will happen when God acts to help his people. Jesus does not directly quote either of these lists, but he wants John’s disciples to know that what he has done is what God promised would happen when the Messiah came. If it would be helpful in your language, you could include a footnote that refers to the lists in Isaiah, or you could include a small amount of explanatory information. Alternate translation: [Just as God promised, the blind are seeing again, and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised, and the poor are being told the gospel]
11:5	tjuc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	τυφλοὶ & χωλοὶ & κωφοὶ & νεκροὶ & πτωχοὶ	1	Jesus is using the adjectives **blind**, **lame**, **deaf**, **dead**, and **poor** as nouns in order to describe groups of people.

Alternate translation: [lepers become clean … the dead come back to life, and the poor hear the gospel]
11:5	gnt2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	λεπροὶ καθαρίζονται	1	Much as in [10:8](../10/08.md), Jesus speaks of ceremonially cleansing lepers, but he implies that the lepers are healed of their skin diseases, since these are what make lepers unclean. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [lepers are healed from their unclean diseases]
11:5	v274		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	νεκροὶ ἐγείρονται	1	The phrase **the dead are raised** refers to people who have died becoming alive again. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [the dead live again]

11:6	yyuo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	μὴ σκανδαλισθῇ ἐν ἐμοί	1	Jesus speaks as if he were a lump or rock that people could **stumble on**. He means that some people will reject and desert him because of what he does and because of what will happen to him. However, those who do not reject or desert him will be **blessed**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [does not desert me because of what I do] or [does not run away from me]
11:7	vt51		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	The word **Now** introduces the next event in the story. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the next event, or you could leave **Now** untranslated. Alternate translation: [Then]
11:7	d4lo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	τούτων	1	The pronoun **these** refers to John’s disciples. If this is not clear for your readers, you could refer more directly to these people. Alternate translation: [John’s disciples]

If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or exclamations. Alternate translation: [Surely you did not go out into the wilderness to see a reed shaken by the wind!] or [I know what you went out into the wilderness to see. It was not a reed shaken by the wind.]
11:7	f3f1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τί ἐξήλθατε εἰς τὴν ἔρημον θεάσασθαι	1	Jesus implies that the people went out to see and hear John the Baptist.

11:7	ydn2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	κάλαμον ὑπὸ ἀνέμου σαλευόμενον	1	The phrase **a reed being shaken by the wind** could describe: (1) a person who changes his or her mind or message whenever there is any trouble or difficulty, just like a **reed** moves whenever the **wind** blows. Alternate translation: [a man who changes his message whenever it is convenient] or [a man who changes his mind as easily as a reed is shaken by the wind]; (2) something or someone ordinary, just like **a reed being shaken by the wind** was a common or normal sight in Matthew’s culture. Alternate translation: [something ordinary, like a reed being shaken by the wind]
11:7	w269		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	κάλαμον ὑπὸ ἀνέμου σαλευόμενον	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [a reed that the wind shakes]
11:8	fn2f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλὰ	1	The word **But** introduces a contrast with the possibility that Jesus asked about in the previous verse.

11:8	y24r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἄνθρωπον ἐν μαλακοῖς ἠμφιεσμένον	1	Matthew assumes that readers will know that John wore crude, rugged clothing. Like his residence in the desert, his clothing was a symbolic protest against the established order. As such, it would have been offensive rather than attractive. So no one would have gone out just to see a person dressed that way. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: [A man wearing splendid clothing? You would not have gone to hear John if that was what you wanted to see.]
11:8	nrdy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐν & ἠμφιεσμένον	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [who had put on]
11:8	by2l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μαλακοῖς & τὰ μαλακὰ	1	The term **soft clothing** refers to luxurious or expensive clothes, since normal clothing was rough. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [splendid clothing … splendid clothing] or [expensive clothing … expensive clothing]
11:8	n2k6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	The word **behold** draws the attention of the audience and asks them to listen carefully.

Alternate translation: [Listen] or [As you know]
11:9	msgi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	ἀλλὰ	1	Here, much as in [11:8](../11/08.md), the word **But** introduces a contrast with the possibility that Jesus asked about in the previous verse.

11:9	lfls		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	τί ἐξήλθατε? προφήτην ἰδεῖν?	1	Here the two questions could be divided so that the phrase **To see** goes with: (1) **a prophet**. See the ULT. (2) **go out**. Alternate translation: [what did you go out to see? A prophet?]
11:9	gm97		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ἀλλὰ τί ἐξήλθατε? προφήτην ἰδεῖν	1	Jesus is using the question form to teach the crowds about John. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate these questions as statements or exclamations.

11:9	iytz			λέγω ὑμῖν	1	Jesus uses the clause **I say to you** to emphasize what he is telling the crowds. Use a natural form in your language for emphasizing the truth and importance of a statement. Alternate translation: [I want you to know]
11:9	fb75		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	καὶ περισσότερον	1	Jesus is leaving out some of the words that a sentence would need in many languages to be complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply these words from the context. Alternate translation: [and he was more than]
11:9	rp94		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	περισσότερον προφήτου	1	Jesus means that John was indeed a prophet, but that he was even **more** than a typical prophet. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [not just an ordinary prophet] or [greater than the other prophets]
11:10	ttv5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	οὗτός	1	The pronoun **This** refers to John the Baptist. If this is not clear for your readers, you could use the person’s name here. Alternate translation: [John]
11:10	ts9k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	γέγραπται	1	In Matthew’s culture, **it is written** was a normal way to introduce a quotation from an important text, in this case, the book of Malachi (see [Malachi 3:1](../../mal/03/01.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase that indicates that Jesus is quoting from an important text. Alternate translation: [you can read in the Scriptures] or [it says in the book of Malachi]
11:10	de17		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	γέγραπται	1	If your language does not use the passive form, you can state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [Malachi wrote in the Scriptures]
11:10	jc00		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	The word **Behold** draws the attention of the audience and asks them to listen carefully. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express **Behold** with a word or phrase that asks the audience to listen, or you could draw the audience’s attention in another way.

11:10	fi5e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	πρὸ προσώπου σου	1	The phrase **before your face** means before or in front of the person.

11:10	mzmx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	σου	-1	The words **your**, **your**, and **you** are singular because God is speaking to the Messiah individually in this quotation.
11:10	kva7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	κατασκευάσει τὴν ὁδόν σου ἔμπροσθέν σου	1	The author of the quotation speaks of helping people to get ready for the coming of the Messiah as if the messenger were preparing the **way** or road for the Messiah. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [will help people get ready for you to arrive]
11:11	z5yq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν γεννητοῖς γυναικῶν	1	The phrase **those born of women** refers to all people who have lived.

11:11	r9ws		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐν γεννητοῖς γυναικῶν	1	If you would like to retain the idiom but your language does not use the passive form in this way, you could state this in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [among those whom women have borne]
11:11	c093		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litotes	οὐκ ἐγήγερται & μείζων	1	Jesus is using a figure of speech here that expresses a strongly positive meaning by using a negative word, **not**, together with an expression that is the opposite of the intended meaning, **greater**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the positive meaning. Alternate translation: [there have only arisen ones lesser than]
11:11	jm5o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	οὐκ ἐγήγερται	1	Jesus speaks of people having lived as if they had **arisen**, or stood up. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [there has not existed] or [there has not lived]
11:11	cag4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ὁ & μικρότερος	1	Matthew is using the adjective **least** as a noun to mean people who are not very important. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this phrase with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: [the least important person]
11:11	pxbl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	μείζων αὐτοῦ ἐστιν	1	The implication is that being part of **the kingdom of the heavens** is greater than any human distinctive. So anyone who is part of **the kingdom** is greater than even John, whom Jesus said was the greatest person who had ever lived before the coming of **the kingdom**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: [is greater than John is because he or she is part of something greater than anything that is human]
11:12	c2qi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Based on how this verse is interpreted (see the following notes and the chapter introduction), the word **But** could introduce: (1) a contrast with what Jesus said in the previous verse about how great the kingdom of the heavens is.

Alternate translation: [Now,]
11:12	mb4v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τῶν ἡμερῶν	1	The word **days** refers to a specific period of time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [the time period]
11:12	ynqo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	Ἰωάννου τοῦ Βαπτιστοῦ	1	Jesus is using the possessive form to describe **days** in which **John the Baptist** preached. If this is not clear in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: [when John the Baptist ministered]

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the clauses with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: [the kingdom of the heavens suffers violence; yes, violent men take it by force]
11:12	inr2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἡ Βασιλεία τῶν Οὐρανῶν βιάζεται	1	Christians disagree about what exactly this clause means. See the chapter introduction for more information and options. Most likely, the clause could mean: (1) that people attack God’s kingdom. Alternate translation: [the kingdom of the heavens is attacked violently]; (2) that God’s kingdom triumphs forcefully in the world. Alternate translation: [the kingdom of the heavens triumphs forcefully]
11:12	qy4w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	βιάζεται	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **violence**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [is violently treated] or [is attacked violently]
11:12	rjlg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	βιασταὶ ἁρπάζουσιν αὐτήν	1	Christians disagree about what exactly this clause means. See the chapter introduction for more information and options.

Alternate translation: [violent men attack it forcefully]; (2) that the **men** are forceful and want to be part of the kingdom. Alternate translation: [forceful men take hold of it]
11:12	viv4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	βιασταὶ	1	Although the term **men** is masculine, Jesus is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that makes this clear. Alternate translation: [violent men and women]
11:12	ce88		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἁρπάζουσιν αὐτήν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **force**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [take it forcefully]
11:13	xfx5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	The word **For** introduces a further explanation of how John is an important or significant person. As the last verse showed, the kingdom of the heavens has “suffered violence” since John began his ministry, and this verse shows that **the Prophets** and **the Law** prophesied about these things up to the time when John began his ministry. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a further explanation, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: [Indeed,] or [In fact,]

Alternate translation: [all the Prophets and the Law contain what people have prophesied]
11:13	r95f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	οἱ προφῆται καὶ ὁ νόμος	1	Jesus is referring to all of God’s word that had been written up to that time. He is using the names of two of its major components to do so. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [the Scriptures]
11:13	s8h8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἕως Ἰωάννου ἐπροφήτευσαν	1	Jesus implies that the Scriptures include prophecies about the kingdom of the heavens, Jesus’ ministry, and all the things that were happening once John and then Jesus began their ministries. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. If possible, use a general phrase that could refer to many of these events and actions. Alternate translation: [have prophesied until John about what has begun to happen]
11:13	s5ij		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἕως Ἰωάννου	1	Jesus could mean that: (1) **the Prophets and the Law** contain prophecies written down only **until John** began his ministry. Alternate translation: [up to when John began his ministry]; (2) what **the Prophets and the Law** prophesied was a prediction about the future only **until John** began his ministry. Now these prophecies have come true. Alternate translation: [until John began his ministry, when the prophecies came true]
11:14	rdsw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	δέξασθαι, αὐτός	1	Jesus leaves out what will happen if the people are **willing to accept {it}**. He implies that, when they **accept {it}**, they will learn or understand what he is about to tell them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could include this implied idea. Alternate translation: [to accept it, you can be sure that he] or [to accept it, you will understand that he]
11:14	yg2f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	δέξασθαι	1	Jesus could be implying that they need to be willing to **accept**: (1) what Jesus says about John. Alternate translation: [to accept what I tell you]; (2) what the Law and the Prophets prophesied (see [11:13](../11/13.md)). Alternate translation: [to accept what the Law and the Prophets said]
11:14	fj3y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	αὐτός ἐστιν Ἠλείας, ὁ μέλλων ἔρχεσθαι	1	Jesus is referring to a prophecy in [Malachi 4:5–6](../../mal/04/05.md). This prophecy states that God will send **Elijah** before the day of the Lord arrives, and he will prepare people. **Elijah** was a prophet who did many powerful things a long time before Malachi wrote down this prophecy. What Jesus implies is that John the Baptist fulfills this prophecy, and so he is like **Elijah**, just as Malachi prophesied. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [he is the person about whom it is prophesied that someone like Elijah would come] or [he is the one being about to come, whom the prophets named Elijah]
11:14	kb67		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτός	1	The pronoun **he** refers to John the Baptist. If this is not clear for your readers, you could use the person’s name here. Alternate translation: [John the Baptist]

12:intro	y7z6				0	# Matthew 12 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n5. Jesus teaches about the gospel of the kingdom of God, and opposition to Jesus begins ([11:1–12:50](../11/01.md))\n      * Arguments with the Pharisees about the Sabbath ([12:1–14](../12/01.md))\n        * Picking heads of grain on the Sabbath ([12:1–8](../12/01.md))\n        * Healing a man on the Sabbath ([12:9–14](../12/09.md))\n      * Jesus fulfills a quotation from Isaiah ([12:15–21](../12/15.md))\n      * Argument with the Pharisees about casting out demons ([12:22–30](../12/22.md))\n      * Jesus teaches on words and God’s judgment ([12:31–37](../12/31.md))\n      * Jesus condemns “this generation” ([12:38–45](../12/38.md))\n      * Jesus’ true family ([12:46–50](../12/46.md))\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [12:18–21](../12/18.md), which is a quotation from [Isaiah 42:1–4](../../isa/42/01.md).\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### The Sabbath\n\nIn the law that God gave to Moses, God commanded the Israelites to rest on the seventh day, which was called the Sabbath. The Jewish religious leaders disagreed with each other about what kinds of things a person could do on the Sabbath and still rest as God had commanded. For example, they debated which emergencies were serious enough that someone could do work on the Sabbath without disobeying God’s command. In [12:1–14](../12/01.md), the Pharisees and Jesus engage in these kinds of debates about the Sabbath. Jesus disagrees with how the Pharisees understand the Sabbath, and he argues for a different view. If your readers may not understand what the Sabbath is and why Jesus and the Pharisees are debating about it, you may need to include some information in a footnote. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/sabbath]])\n\n### Casting out demons\n\nDemons are evil spiritual beings who can control people and who serve Satan. They usually use the people they control to hurt themselves or others. In [12:22](../12/22.md), Matthew briefly describes how Jesus drove out a demon who caused the man it controlled to be blind and mute, that is, unable to see or speak. In response, the crowds wonder whether Jesus is the special “Son of David.” However, the Pharisees accuse Jesus of using the power of Beelzebul, that is, Satan, to cast out demons. Jesus tells them that it does not make sense for Satan, who rules the demons, to empower someone to cast out demons.\n\n### “Blasphemy against the Spirit”\n\nIn [12:31–32](../12/31.md), Jesus speaks about “blasphemy of the Spirit” and speaking “against the Holy Spirit.” He indicates that God will forgive all kinds of sins, including speaking against Jesus himself. However, God will not forgive people who speak against the Holy Spirit. Jesus says these things because the Pharisees said that he cast out demons by the power of Beelzebul. Jesus implies that he actually cast out demons by the power of the Holy Spirit. So, since the Pharisees have called the Holy Spirit Beelzebul, they have blasphemed or spoken against the Spirit. Christians debate what counts as this kind of blasphemy and why God will not forgive people for it. In your translation, you should express the idea as generally as Jesus does. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/blasphemy]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/holyspirit]])\n\n### The sign of Jonah\n\nIn [12:39–41](../12/39.md), Jesus refers to a story about a prophet named Jonah. God told Jonah to prophesy in the city of Nineveh that God would destroy it. Jonah instead got on a boat to go the opposite direction. God sent a bad storm on the ocean, and to stop the storm Jonah had the sailors throw him into the ocean. God then had a huge fish swallow Jonah. He was inside the fish for three days and three nights, and then the fish spit Jonah out onto the shore. Jonah then did prophesy in the city of Nineveh, and the people there repented and asked God for mercy. In response, God chose not to destroy the city. You can read this story in [Jonah 1–4](../../jon/01/01.md). When Jesus refers to “the sign of Jonah,” he is speaking about this story, particularly about how Jonah was in the fish for three days and nights. Jesus indicates that he will be in his tomb for three days, just as Jonah was in the fish for three days.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### The parable about the strong man\n\nIn [12:29](../12/29.md), Jesus describes how thieves must subdue and tie up a strong man before they can steal things from his house. Jesus does not directly state how to apply this proverb. However, most Christians think that Satan is like the strong man, and the demons that Jesus casts out are like the strong man’s things. In this case, Jesus is like the thieves who tie up the strong man. Jesus is saying that, since he can cast out demons, it proves that he has subdued and conquered Satan, just as thieves can only steal things after they have subdued the strong man. You should not include this extra information in your translation, but if it would be helpful for your readers, you could include it in a footnote. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])\n\n### Demons living in people as if they were houses\n\nIn [12:43–45](../12/43.md), Jesus tells a story that describes people as if they were houses that demons could live in. When a demon is living in someone, this means that the demon is controlling that person. If possible, preserve this metaphor. If it is necessary, you could use simile form or state the meaning more plainly. See the notes on this verse for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Jesus’ mother and brothers\n\nIn [12:46–50](../12/46.md), Jesus’ mother and brothers arrive and want to talk with Jesus. In response, Jesus says that his disciples, those who do God’s will, are his mother and brothers and sisters. In other words, Jesus calls his disciples, who are those who do God’s will, his family members. He means that they are as close and important to him as his own family. This is an important metaphor that appears throughout the Bible, so preserve the metaphor or express the idea in simile form. See the notes on these verses for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMost of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in speeches that Jesus gives to many people around him. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are plural. You should assume forms of “you” are plural unless a note specifies that the form is singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### The quotation from [Isaiah 42:1–4](../../isa/42/01.md) in [12:18–21](../12/18.md)\n\nMatthew quotes a long section of Isaiah in this chapter. However, he does not quote every line, specifically leaving out parts of [Isaiah 42:4](../../isa/42/04.md). Also, in many places his quotation does not directly match the Hebrew version of Isaiah. However, since Matthew quotes these verses for a specific reason and in a different language (Greek), you should translate what Matthew wrote, not what you might find in [Isaiah 42:1–4](../../isa/42/01.md).
12:1	m2n1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	ἐν ἐκείνῳ τῷ καιρῷ	1	The phrase **At that time** introduces a new event that happened some time after the events the story has just related.

Alternate translation: [fields where grain is grown]
12:1	rgpc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	The word **but** introduces a contrast with how people were expected to behave **on the Sabbaths**, which included not picking grain or other crops.

12:2	dkze		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	The word **behold** is meant to draw the attention of Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express **behold** with a word or phrase that asks the person to listen or pay attention. Alternate translation: [Listen] or [See]

This kind of work was prohibited on the **Sabbath**. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [are harvesting grain, and that is work that is not lawful to do on the Sabbath]
12:3-4	d712		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	οὐκ ἀνέγνωτε τί ἐποίησεν Δαυεὶδ, ὅτε ἐπείνασεν καὶ οἱ μετ’ αὐτοῦ & πῶς εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ τοὺς ἄρτους τῆς Προθέσεως ἔφαγεν, ὃ οὐκ ἐξὸν ἦν αὐτῷ φαγεῖν, οὐδὲ τοῖς μετ’ αὐτοῦ, εἰ μὴ τοῖς ἱερεῦσιν μόνοις?	1	Jesus is using the question form to show the Pharisees that they should have learned a principle from the story about **David** that indicates that they are wrong to criticize the disciples. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: [You have not understood what you have read about what David did when he was hungry, and the ones with him—how he went into the house of God and ate the loaves of the Presence, which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for the ones with him, except only for the priests.]
12:3-4	ov8o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	οὐκ ἀνέγνωτε τί ἐποίησεν Δαυεὶδ, ὅτε ἐπείνασεν καὶ οἱ μετ’ αὐτοῦ & πῶς εἰσῆλθεν εἰς τὸν οἶκον τοῦ Θεοῦ, καὶ τοὺς ἄρτους τῆς Προθέσεως ἔφαγεν, ὃ οὐκ ἐξὸν ἦν αὐτῷ φαγεῖν, οὐδὲ τοῖς μετ’ αὐτοῦ, εἰ μὴ τοῖς ἱερεῦσιν μόνοις?	1	Jesus refers to a story about **David** before he became king. The current king, Saul was trying to kill David, so David ran away to the priest who was serving God at the time. David and the men who ran away with him were very hungry, so they asked the priest for food. The priest gave them the special bread that was laid out in God’s presence every day, and David and his men ate this bread. You can read this story in [1 Samuel 21:1–6](../../1sa/21/01.md). If it would be helpful in your language, you could include some extra information in your translation or in a footnote. Alternate translation: [Have you not read what David did when he was hungry after he escaped from King Saul, who wanted to kill him? He and the ones with him visited the priest, went into the house of God, and ate the loaves of the Presence, which was not lawful for him to eat, nor for the ones with him, except only for the priests.]

12:4	lkx9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions	εἰ μὴ τοῖς ἱερεῦσιν μόνοις	1	Jesus indicates that the only people who were allowed to eat this **bread** were **the priests**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that introduces this kind of exception. Alternate translation: [since only the priests could eat it] or [which was lawful only for the priests to eat]
12:5	f79q		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ἢ οὐκ ἀνέγνωτε ἐν τῷ νόμῳ, ὅτι τοῖς Σάββασιν οἱ ἱερεῖς ἐν τῷ ἱερῷ τὸ Σάββατον βεβηλοῦσιν, καὶ ἀναίτιοί εἰσιν?	1	Jesus is using the question form to show the Pharisees that they should have learned a principle from the laws about priests working on **the Sabbath** that indicates that they are wrong to criticize the disciples. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: [Again, you have not understood what you have read in the law about how on the Sabbaths the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath, but are innocent.]
12:5	bkjv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	ἢ	1	The word **Or** introduces a second example from the Scriptures that Jesus uses to prove his point.

If it would be helpful to your readers, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: [profane the Sabbath by doing priestly work]
12:5	i9ys		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀναίτιοί εἰσιν	1	Jesus means that, although the priests do work on the Sabbath, the law does not condemn them, since doing priestly work on the Sabbath is an exception to the Sabbath requirements. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: [are innocent, since God permits this kind of work on the Sabbaths]
12:6	b6i0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	The word **But** introduces a slight contrast with what Jesus has said about how serving in **the temple** is an exception to keeping the Sabbath.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces this kind of contrast. Alternate translation: [And yet] or [But now]
12:6	k4mn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-extrainfo	μεῖζόν	1	The word **something** is a very general term. It could refer to the kingdom of God, Jesus himself, the ministry that Jesus begins, what Jesus calls his disciples to do, or many other things.

The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: [He will not break a bruised reed; yes, he will not quench a smoking flax]

If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: [This might be the Son of David.] or [Maybe this is the Son of David!]
12:23	h8kf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὁ υἱὸς Δαυείδ	1	Here, the word **Son** means a male descendant. It does not mean that Jesus was the direct son of David. Express the idea as you did in [9:27](../09/27.md). Alternate translation: [the Descendant of David] or [you who are descended from David]
12:23	ink7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ὁ υἱὸς Δαυείδ	1	**David** was Israel’s most important king, and God had promised him that one of his descendants would be the Messiah. So the title **Son of David** could implicitly mean “Messiah.” Express the idea as you did in [9:27](../09/27.md). Alternate translation: [the Son of David, the Messiah]
12:24	jibk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀκούσαντες	1	Matthew implies that Pharisees heard what the crowds were asking about Jesus (see [12:23](../12/23.md)).

12:25	plnm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	δὲ	1	Here, the word **But** introduces the next thing that happened.

The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the sentences with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second sentence is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: [Every kingdom divided against itself is made desolate; indeed, every city or house divided against itself will not stand]
12:25	g9ec		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	πᾶσα βασιλεία μερισθεῖσα καθ’ ἑαυτῆς ἐρημοῦται, καὶ πᾶσα πόλις ἢ οἰκία μερισθεῖσα καθ’ ἑαυτῆς οὐ σταθήσεται	1	The words **kingdom**, **city**, and **house** represent the people who live in those places.

12:26	yixz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-contrary	εἰ ὁ Σατανᾶς τὸν Σατανᾶν ἐκβάλλει, ἐφ’ ἑαυτὸν ἐμερίσθη	1	Jesus is making a conditional statement that sounds hypothetical, but he is already convinced that the condition is not true. He has concluded that **Satan** is not **divided against himself**, because Satan has not **been divided against himself**. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a condition that the speaker believes is not true. Alternate translation: [were Satan to cast out Satan, he would have been divided against himself]
12:26	i42r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὁ Σατανᾶς τὸν Σατανᾶν ἐκβάλλει	1	In both places, **Satan** represents people who act by the power of Satan. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your language or state the meaning plainly.

He knows that he does not **cast out demons by Beelzebul**, but he wants to show what would also be true if he did **cast out demons by Beelzebul**. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a condition that the speaker believes is not true. Alternate translation: [were I to be casting out the demons by Beelzebul, by whom would your sons be casting them out]
12:27	f00a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εἰ ἐγὼ ἐν Βεελζεβοὺλ ἐκβάλλω τὰ δαιμόνια, οἱ υἱοὶ ὑμῶν ἐν τίνι ἐκβάλλουσιν	1	The implication is that the people challenging Jesus would not say that their own followers were using the power of Beelzebul, and so they should agree that he is not using that power himself. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: [if I cast out the demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Since you do not believe that they cast out demons by Beelzebul, it must not be true about me, either.]
12:27	gee9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	οἱ υἱοὶ ὑμῶν ἐν τίνι ἐκβάλλουσιν?	1	Jesus is using the question form to show that the **sons** of the Pharisees must use the same power that he uses.

12:27	scn6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	διὰ τοῦτο	1	Jesus implies that the Pharisees would not say that their **sons** cast out demons by Beelzebul, and the phrase **Because of this** introduces a result based on this implied answer. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make the reason for this result more explicit.

12:27	jja2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	αὐτοὶ κριταὶ ἔσονται ὑμῶν	1	Jesus speaks of the **sons** of the Pharisees as if they were the Pharisees’ **judges**. He means that what the **sons** do proves that the Pharisees are wrong about what they have said about Jesus. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [what they do proves that you are wrong] or [when they cast out demons, it shows that you have spoken falsely]
12:28	j0yv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-contrast	δὲ	1	The word **But** introduces a contrast with what the Pharisees have said about how Jesus casts out demons. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces this kind of contrast. Alternate translation: [On the other hand,] or [In contrast,]

If your language does not state something as a condition if it is certain or true, and if your readers might think that what Jesus is saying is uncertain, then you could translate his words as an affirmative statement. Alternate translation: [since I cast out the demons by the Spirit of God, the kingdom of God has come upon you]
12:28	r5dg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἔφθασεν ἐφ’ ὑμᾶς ἡ Βασιλεία τοῦ Θεοῦ	1	Jesus speaks as if **the kingdom of God** had **come upon** the Pharisees. He means that God is making where they and Jesus are into part of his **kingdom**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly.

12:29	t4vu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables	ἢ πῶς δύναταί τις	1	To help the Pharisees understand what he has been saying, Jesus offers a brief illustration. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. For an explanation of this parable, see the chapter introduction. Alternate translation: [Here is an illustration of what I mean: how is anyone able]
12:29	w54c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	ἢ πῶς δύναταί τις εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὴν οἰκίαν τοῦ ἰσχυροῦ καὶ τὰ σκεύη αὐτοῦ ἁρπάσαι, ἐὰν μὴ πρῶτον δήσῃ τὸν ἰσχυρόν?	1	Jesus is using the question form to show that a **strong man** must be **tied up** before someone can **steal his possessions**. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: [No one is able to enter into the house of the strong man and steal his possessions if he has not first tied up the strong man.] or [It is impossible for anyone to enter into the house of the strong man and steal his possessions if he has not first bound the strong man!]

12:29	b2et		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	μὴ πρῶτον δήσῃ & διαρπάσει	1	Although the term **he** in both these places is masculine, Jesus is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women.

12:29	tsrk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτοῦ διαρπάσει	1	The word **he** refers to the person who is stealing. The word **his** refers to the strong man. If this is not clear for your readers, you could refer to these people more directly. Alternate translation: [the thief will plunder the strong man’s]
12:30	lvjf			ὁ μὴ ὢν μετ’ ἐμοῦ κατ’ ἐμοῦ ἐστιν; καὶ ὁ μὴ συνάγων μετ’ ἐμοῦ σκορπίζει	1	Jesus is not referring to a specific individual. Rather, he is making a general statement that applies to any person or group of people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that refers to any person. Alternate translation: [Anyone who is not with me is against me, and anyone who does not gather with me scatters] or [Those who are not with me are against me, and those who do not gather with me scatter]
12:30	ivp9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ὁ μὴ ὢν μετ’ ἐμοῦ	1	The phrase **with me** describes people who support or are friendly to Jesus.

12:31	kqx0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πᾶσα ἁμαρτία καὶ βλασφημία	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **sin** and **blasphemy**, you could express the same ideas in another way.

It makes sense to say that a tree and its fruit together are either **good** or **rotten**. It does not make sense to say that a tree is good and its fruit **rotten** or that a tree is **rotten** and its fruit **good**. That is because trees are **known** by their fruits. Similarly, people who follow God do what is right, and people who do not follow God do what is wrong. It does not make sense to say that someone who does what is right is not following God or that someone who does what is wrong is following God. Most likely, Jesus wishes to apply this figure of speech both to himself (a good tree) and to the Pharisees (bad trees). If possible, preserve the figure of speech or use simile form. Alternate translation: [Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree rotten and its fruit rotten. Similarly, either call people good and their deeds good, or call people bad and their deeds bad. For, just as a tree is known by its fruit, so people are known by their deeds]

Alternate translation: [Either consider both the tree and its fruit good, or consider both the tree and its fruit bad]; (2) people can **make** a tree either **good** or **rotten** by how they care for that tree. Then, the tree will **make** fruit that fits with how people cared for that tree. Alternate translation: [Either make the tree good, and it will make its fruit good, or make the tree rotten, and it will make its fruit rotten] or [Either make the tree good, and its fruit will be good, or make the tree rotten, and its fruit will be rotten]; (3) a tree produces fruit that fits with what kind of tree it is. Alternate translation: [Either a tree is good and produces good fruit, or a tree is rotten and produces rotten fruit]
12:33	kl16		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	τὸ δένδρον	-1	The word **tree** represents trees in general, not one particular tree. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: [any tree … any tree … every tree]

12:34	o2xp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	πονηροὶ ὄντες	1	Here, the phrase **being evil** gives the reason why Jesus implies that the Pharisees cannot **say good things**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make that idea more explicit. Alternate translation: [since you are evil]
12:34	e7x3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	πῶς δύνασθε ἀγαθὰ λαλεῖν	1	Jesus is using the question form to rebuke the Pharisees for failing to speak **good things**. If you would not use the question form for this purpose in your language, you could translate this as a statement or an exclamation. Alternate translation: [you are certainly not able to say good things] or [you are never able to say good things!]
12:34	kywr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a reason why **evil** people cannot **say good things**.

When **the heart** is full, it overflows out through **the mouth**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable figure of speech or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [whatever fills the heart comes out of the mouth] or [whatever is in the heart is what the mouth speaks]
12:34	mbh4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	τῆς καρδίας, τὸ στόμα λαλεῖ	1	The words **heart** and **mouth** represents people’s hearts and mouths in general, not one particular person’s heart and mouth. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: [of their hearts people’s mouths speak]
12:34	e9bg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τῆς καρδίας	1	In Matthew’s culture, **the heart** is the place where humans think and feel. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate **heart** by referring to the place where humans think and feel in your culture or by stating the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [of the thoughts] or [of the desires]
12:34	i7c6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	τὸ στόμα λαλεῖ	1	Here, the word **mouth** represents the person as a whole, in the act of speaking.

The ULT does this with the poetry in [13:14–15](../13/14.md), which is a quote from [Isaiah 6:9–10](../../isa/06/09.md), and in [13:35](../13/35.md), which is a quote from [Psalm 78:2](../../psa/078/002.md).\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Farming\n\nJesus refers to many different farming practices in this chapter. In his culture, farmers often threw seeds over their fields, a process called sowing. After throwing the seeds, they would use a tool called a plow to cover the seeds with dirt. Then they would water and take care of the seeds until they sprouted and grew. Finally, when the plants produced grain or other kinds of crops, they would cut down the plants, separate the edible parts from the inedible parts, and store the edible parts in a safe place. See the notes on the verses in which Jesus discusses farming practices for specific information and translation options.\n\n### Darnel\n\nDarnel are plants that look much like wheat plants. However, they do not produce the same kind of grain, and the grain that they do produce is somewhat poisonous. In your translation, you could refer to a plant that looks like wheat or grain plants, or you could use a descriptive phrase. See the notes for translation options.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Parables\n\nThroughout this chapter, Jesus uses many parables to teach the crowds and his disciples. Each parable is a short story that includes a specific lesson. Jesus uses parables to teach so that people who already know his message will learn more but people who do not know his message will not learn anything (see [13:10–17](../13/10.md)). Jesus explains three of the parables, but he does not explain any of the others. Possible explanations for each parable are included below, but only for help in translation. Your translation should not directly explain the meaning of any parable more than Jesus does. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])\n\n  * **The parable of the sower**—In [13:3–9](../13/03.md), Jesus tells a story about a man who sows seed and about what happens to the seed. Jesus explains this parable in [13:18–23](../13/18.md). Even with this explanation, Christians debate who the sower is, what the seed represents, and what the different areas in the field represent. The sower could be Jesus himself, God, or anyone who preaches the gospel. The seed could be the gospel or the person who hears the gospel. The different areas in the field could be regions or areas where people hear the gospel, different kinds of people, or different ways of responding to the gospel. Most likely, the seed and the area in the field together describe what happens when people respond to the gospel in these four ways.\n\n  * **The parable of the darnel**—In [13:24–30](../13/24.md), Jesus tells a story about a farmer who planted good seed and the farmer’s enemy who planted darnel seed in the same field. Jesus explains this parable in [13:37–43](../13/37.md). Jesus is the farmer, and the good seed are people who believe in him. The enemy is the devil, and the darnel seed are people who serve him. The farmer in the story allows the darnel to grow until the harvest, when he has them cut down and burned. Similarly, Jesus allows people who serve the devil to live until this time period ends, when he will have his angels collect these people. Then, he will judge and punish them, and he will reward those who believed in him.\n\n  * **The parable of the mustard seed**—In [13:31–32](../13/31.md), Jesus tells a story about how a very small seed (a mustard seed) grows into a very large plant. Most likely, he is describing how his group of followers was very small but will eventually become very large. Jesus mentions that birds nest in the branches of this large plant. Some people think that Jesus is referring to passages like [Ezekiel 17:23](../../ezk/17/23.md), which could suggest that the birds represent Gentiles who become part of God’s kingdom. Others think that the detail about the birds simply illustrates how large the plant is. If possible, your translation should allow for all of these interpretations.\n\n  * **The parable of the yeast**—In [13:33](../13/33.md), Jesus tells a story about how a woman leavened a large amount of flour with some yeast. Most likely, he is describing how his message and his followers will affect many things. He could be speaking about how his message completely changes people. Or, he could be speaking about how his message and his followers will spread throughout the whole world. Or, he could be speaking about how his message and his followers are small and insignificant but affect the whole world. If possible, your translation should allow for all of these interpretations.\n\n  * **The parable of the treasure in the field**—In [13:44](../13/44.md), Jesus tells a story about a worker who discovered a hidden treasure in a field that belonged to someone else. To obtain the treasure, the worker sold everything that he had and bought the field. Most likely, Jesus means that being part of God’s kingdom is very valuable, like a treasure, and people should be willing to give up everything to be part of the kingdom.\n\n  * **The parable of the pearl**—In [13:45–46](../13/45.md), Jesus tells a story about a merchant who wanted to obtain valuable pearls. When he saw a very expensive pearl, he sold everything that he had and bought the pearl. Most likely, Jesus means that being part of God’s kingdom is very valuable, like an expensive pearl, and that people should be willing to give up everything to be part of the kingdom.\n\n  * **The parable of the net**—In [13:47–48](../13/47.md), Jesus tells a story about fishermen who use a net to catch many kinds of fish, some useful and some useless. They sort through the fish, keeping the good ones and throwing away the bad ones. Jesus explains this parable in [13:49–50](../13/49.md). The fish are like people, and the fishermen are like angels. At the end of this time period, the angels will separate righteous people from wicked people, just like the fishermen sorted the fish. Then, the wicked people will be punished, just as the useless fish were thrown away.\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMost of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in speeches that Jesus gives to many people around him. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are plural. You should assume forms of “you” are plural unless a note specifies that the form is singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
13:1	vx5y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ ἐκείνῃ	1	Here, the phrase **On that day** introduces the next major event in the story, an event that happened on the same day as the teaching recorded in the previous chapter. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that introduces an event that happened later during the same day. Alternate translation: [Sometime later that day]
13:1	avp6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	ἐξελθὼν	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “come” instead of **gone**. Alternate translation: [having come out]
13:1	cy1t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τῆς οἰκίας	1	Matthew refers to **the house** that Jesus was in while he was teaching what is recorded in the previous chapter.

13:2	d16z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	συνήχθησαν πρὸς αὐτὸν ὄχλοι πολλοί	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [large crowds gathered to him] or [large crowds came to listen to him]
13:2	d0v5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	καθῆσθαι	1	Just as in the previous verse, Jesus **sat down** to teach. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [sat down down to instruct the people] or [sat down as a teacher does]
13:2	us0a		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ἐπὶ τὸν αἰγιαλὸν	1	The word **beach** refers to the ground next to a body of water when this ground is covered by sand or small rocks.

13:3	f5mv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	ἐν παραβολαῖς λέγων	1	Consider natural ways of introducing direct quotations in your language. Alternate translation: [in parables. Here is what he said:]
13:3	o5f9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables	ἰδοὺ, ἐξῆλθεν ὁ σπείρων	1	To teach the people in the crowd, Jesus offers a story or illustration. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: [Listen to this story: the sower went out]
13:3	khx4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	ἰδοὺ & ὁ σπείρων	1	Here Jesus introduces a **sower** as a character in his story. If your language has its own way of introducing new participants, you could use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: [Behold, there was a sower. He]
13:3	kcvm		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	The word **Behold** draws the attention of the audience and asks them to listen carefully.

Alternate translation: [Look] or [Listen]
13:4	gw0z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐν τῷ σπείρειν αὐτὸν	1	While there are many ways to sow or plant seeds, here Jesus is describing a practice in which farmers pick up handfuls of seed and throw them so that they are scattered all over the top of the soil. This method is a quick and easy way to plant seeds in large fields, but some seeds land on ground that is not good for them to grow in. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make it more explicit what kind of sowing this is. Alternate translation: [as he threw the seeds over the ground] or [as he scattered the seeds over the field]
13:4	qr2d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἃ μὲν ἔπεσεν παρὰ τὴν ὁδόν, καὶ ἦλθεν τὰ πετεινὰ καὶ κατέφαγεν αὐτά	1	Here Jesus implies that the seeds that fall **beside the road** do not sink into the ground. Instead, they just sit on top of the hard-packed dirt by the **road** and are unprotected from birds. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [some fell on the hard ground beside the road, and the birds came and easily devoured them]
13:4	cvj4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἃ	1	Jesus is using the adjective **some** as a noun to mean some of the seeds. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: [some seeds]
13:4	rdmi		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	τὰ πετεινὰ	1	The phrase **the birds** represents any birds, not particular birds. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: [birds]
13:5	ql87		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἄλλα	1	Jesus is using the adjective **others** as a noun to mean some of the rest of the seeds that did not fall beside the road.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that describes this kind of area. Alternate translation: [a thin layer of soil on top of rocks] or [a rocky area, where there was very little soil]
13:5	njjm			οὐκ εἶχεν & ἐξανέτειλεν διὰ τὸ μὴ ἔχειν	1	Here Jesus refers back to the **others** as a group using singular words.

13:5	x4av		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	εὐθέως ἐξανέτειλεν διὰ τὸ μὴ ἔχειν βάθος γῆς	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these clauses, since the second clause gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: [because it did not have deep soil, immediately it sprang up]
13:5	nz17		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐξανέτειλεν	1	Here, the phrase **sprang up** refers to how plants sprout or begin to grow. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase. Alternate translation: [it came up] or [it began to grow]
13:6	pz44		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἡλίου & ἀνατείλαντος	1	Here, the phrase **the sun had risen** refers to the sun coming up over the horizon in the morning. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [when the sun came up] or [in the morning when the sun began to shine]
13:6	nqjf			ἐκαυματίσθη καὶ διὰ τὸ μὴ ἔχειν ῥίζαν ἐξηράνθη	1	Here, much as in [13:5](../13/05.md), Jesus refers to the plants that sprouted from the seeds by using singular words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use plural words to refer to these plants. Alternate translation: [they were scorched, and because they had no roots, they withered]
13:6	qq5x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐκαυματίσθη	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

13:8	d30o		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐδίδου καρπόν	1	Here the word **fruit** refers to the crop that the plants that grew from the seeds produced. Since the farmer is sowing wheat seeds, this crop would be more wheat seeds. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [were producing more seeds] or [sprouted and produced a harvest]
13:8	tqs8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	καρπόν	1	Here, the word **fruit** is singular in form, but it refers to many fruits as a group. If it would be helpful in your language, you could say this plainly. Alternate translation: [fruits]

Scholars estimate that these numbers are very good in Jesus’ time period, although not impossible or unheard of. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make these ideas more explicit. Alternate translation: [and they produced a very good harvest, with some plants producing 100 seeds, and some plants producing 60 seeds, and other plants producing 30 seeds] or [many times more than the farmer planted: some 100 times more, and some 60 times more, and some 30 times more]
13:9	q2e2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ὁ ἔχων ὦτα, ἀκουέτω	1	This verse is almost identical to [11:15](../11/15.md), although that verse includes the phrase “to hear” after **ears**. Express the idea as you did in [11:15](../11/15.md), but omit the phrase “to hear” if you expressed it explicitly there.
13:9	b9m1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	ἔχων ὦτα	1	Many ancient manuscripts read **having ears**. The ULT follows that reading. Other ancient manuscripts read “having ears to hear.” If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.

Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: [to those people] or [to the crowds]
13:12	x34s		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** could introduce: (1) a reason why God reveals the mysteries of the kingdom to some people and not to other people.

Translate this proverb in a way that will be recognized as a proverb and be meaningful in your language and culture. Alternate translation: [people who have things receive more, and they have an abundance. But people who do not have things lose what they used to have]
13:12	lukr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὅστις & ἔχει, δοθήσεται αὐτῷ καὶ περισσευθήσεται; ὅστις δὲ οὐκ ἔχει, καὶ ὃ ἔχει ἀρθήσεται ἀπ’ αὐτοῦ	1	Jesus implies that what the person **has** or **does not have** is knowledge or understanding about the “mysteries of the kingdom of heaven” (see [13:11](../13/11.md)). You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [whoever has understanding, it will be given to him, and he will have an abundance. But whoever does not have understanding, even what he has will be taken away from him] or [whoever has knowledge about the kingdom, more will be given to him, and he will have an abundance of knowledge. But whoever does not have knowledge about the kingdom, even what knowledge he has will be taken away from him]
13:12	v61y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	δοθήσεται & ἀρθήσεται	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who does the action, it is clear from the context that it is God. Alternate translation: [God will give … God will take away]
13:12	j3rl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	αὐτῷ καὶ περισσευθήσεται & ὃ ἔχει & αὐτοῦ	1	Although the terms **him** and **he** are masculine in this verse, Jesus is using the words in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use phrases that make this clear. Alternate translation: [to that person, and he or she will have an abundance … what that person has … him or her]
13:12	rfgc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	περισσευθήσεται	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **abundance**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [he will abound] or [he will have very much]
13:12	ug61		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ὅστις δὲ οὐκ ἔχει	1	Jesus says **whoever does not have** here as a generalization for emphasis. It is clear in the second half of the sentence that the person did have something. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different way to express the emphasis. Alternate translation: [But whoever has almost nothing] or [But whoever does not have much]
13:13	cagw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	διὰ τοῦτο	1	Here, the pronoun **this** could refer to: (1) what Jesus is about to say, beginning with the word **because**. Alternate translation: [Here is why]; (2) what Jesus said in the previous two verses. Alternate translation: [That is why] or [For those reasons]
13:13	qnsk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτοῖς	1	The pronoun **them** refers to the “crowd” that was standing on the shore of the sea to listen to Jesus (see [13:2](../13/02.md)). Express the idea as you did in [13:10](../13/10.md). Alternate translation: [to the crowd]

13:14	jz9n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	ἀναπληροῦται & ἡ προφητεία Ἠσαΐου ἡ λέγουσα	1	In Jesus’s culture, this was a normal way to introduce a quotation from an important text, in this case, the Old Testament book written by Isaiah the prophet (see [Isaiah 6:9–10](../../isa/06/09.md)). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase that indicates that Jesus is quoting from an important text. Alternate translation: [the prophecy from the book of Isaiah is being fulfilled. Here is the prophecy:] or [is being fulfilled what Isaiah prophesied when he wrote]
13:14	a1im		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	ἀκοῇ ἀκούσετε & βλέποντες βλέψετε	1	The author of the quotation repeats the words **hear** and **see** in order to emphasize that the people really do **hear** and **see**. If your language can repeat words for emphasis, it would be appropriate to use that construction here in your translation. Otherwise, you could express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: [You will certainly hear … you will certainly see] or [You will indeed hear … you will indeed see]
13:14	q4cj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐ μὴ	-1	The words translated as **certainly not** are two negative words in the original Greek. In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: [by no means … by no means]
13:15	mxzy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a reason why the people hear but do not understand and see but do not perceive.

Alternate translation: [That is because] or [That happens since]

If this would not be natural in your language, you could use second person forms in this verse. Alternate translation: [the heart of you people has been thickened, and with your ears you have hardly heard, and you have shut your eyes, lest you might see with your eyes, and you might hear with your ears, and you might understand with your heart and turn back, and I would heal you]

The second and third emphasize the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the clauses with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second and third phrase are repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternatively, you could express the idea with just one or two clauses. Alternate translation: [the heart of this people has been thickened; yes, with their ears they have hardly heard; indeed, they have shut their eyes] or [the heart of this people has been thickened, and they barely use their ears and eyes]

Alternate translation: [the hearts of these people have been thickened … with their hearts]
13:15	driw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐπαχύνθη & ἡ καρδία τοῦ λαοῦ τούτου & τῇ καρδίᾳ	1	In the author’s culture, the **heart** is the place where humans think and feel. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate **heart** by referring to the place where humans think and feel in your culture or by expressing the idea plainly. Alternate translation: [the mind of this people was made dull … with their mind] or [the thoughts of this people were made dull … in their thoughts]
13:15	o0ir		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐπαχύνθη	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [has become thick]

If so, you could shorten them. Alternate translation: [and they have hardly heard anything, and they have shut their eyes, lest they might see clearly, and they might hear clearly]
13:15	u9la		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	καὶ τοῖς ὠσὶν βαρέως ἤκουσαν, καὶ τοὺς ὀφθαλμοὺς αὐτῶν ἐκάμμυσαν	1	The author of the quotation is speaking as if the people of Israel have become unable to hear and have **shut their eyes** so that they will not see. He means that they are refusing to consider what God wants to tell them. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the idea in simile form or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [and they are refusing to pay attention to God, as if they were closing their ears and eyes] or [and they are refusing to consider what God wants to tell them]
13:15	p6we		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ἴδωσιν τοῖς ὀφθαλμοῖς, καὶ τοῖς ὠσὶν ἀκούσωσιν, καὶ τῇ καρδίᾳ συνῶσιν	1	These three clauses mean basically the same thing.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [you, for you see; and blessed are you, for you hear] or [you as you look at things, for you see; and as you listen to things, for you hear]
13:16	rlt3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	βλέπουσιν & ἀκούουσιν	1	Here Jesus implies that their **eyes** can **see** properly and their **ears** can **hear** properly.

You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers.

13:51	k6bw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	λέγουσιν	1	To call attention to a development in the story, Matthew uses the present tense in past narration.

13:56	gko3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	πόθεν οὖν τούτῳ	1	Here, the word **therefore** introduces an inference based on the fact that the people in Jesus’ hometown know his family.

13:57	azn4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐκ ἔστιν & ἄτιμος	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate this double negative that consists of the negative particle **not** and the negative preposition **without**.

14:intro	g5mc				0	# Matthew 14 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n7. Further opposition to Jesus and misunderstanding of the kingdom of God ([13:53–17:27](../13/01.md))\n      * Herod hears about Jesus ([14:1–2](../14/01.md))\n      * Flashback: Herod executes John the Baptist ([14:3–12](../14/03.md))\n      * Jesus feeds 5,000 men ([14:13–21](../14/13.md))\n      * Jesus walks on water ([14:22–33](../14/22.md))\n      * Jesus heals people in the region of Gennesaret ([14:34–36](../14/34.md))\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Herod and Herodias\n\nThe man named “Herod the tetrarch” ([14:1](../14/01.md)) was a son of King Herod, the man mentioned in [2:1–22](../02/01.md). Herod the tetrarch ruled over the area to the northwest of the Sea of Galilee, which is where Jesus spent much of his time of ministry. Herodias was married to Herod’s brother Philip, and the two of them had a daughter. However, Herodias divorced Philip and married Herod, who had also divorced his previous wife. Since the Jewish law condemned anyone who married his brother’s wife while his brother was still alive (see [Leviticus 20:21](../../lev/20/21.md)), John the Baptist rebuked Herod for doing this. It was in response to this rebuke that Herod had John the Baptist put in prison and eventually executed. Make sure that your translation accurately refers to the relationships between Herod, Herodias, and Herodias’ daughter.\n\n### The miracle of multiplying food\n\nIn [14:13–21](../14/13.md), Matthew tells a story in which Jesus provides 5,000 men and even more women and children with food. All these people were in a place where no people lived, and all the food that Jesus and his disciples had were five loaves of bread and two fish. Despite that, Jesus used the five loaves of bread and the two fish to feed everyone who was there. Matthew does not tell us exactly how Jesus did this, but he does say that there were more leftovers than what they started with. Your translation should not explain how Jesus multiplied the food, but it should be clear that he did a miracle.\n\n### The miracle of walking on water\n\nIn [14:22–33](../14/22.md), Matthew tells a story in which Jesus walks on top of the Sea of Galilee, even though there was a storm. Later, Jesus allows Peter to walk briefly on the water, and when Jesus and Peter climb into the boat that the rest of the disciples were in, the storm miraculously stops. Your translation should not explain exactly how Jesus or Peter walked on the water, but it should be clear that Jesus walking on the water, Peter walking on the water, and the storm stopping were all miracles.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### The flashback to John’s death\n\nIn this chapter, Matthew includes a story that happened before the stories that appear before and after it in his narrative. The previous chapter includes much of Jesus’ teaching, and this chapter begins by describing Herod Antipas’ response to Jesus (see [14:1–2](../14/01.md)). Then, to explain what Herod said about Jesus, Matthew includes a story that happened earlier. This type of storytelling is called a flashback. Here, the flashback tells about how John the Baptist died (see [14:3–12](../14/03.md)). In [14:13](../14/13.md), Matthew returns to the main narrative and tells what happened after the events recorded in [chapter 13](../13/01.md) and [14:1–2](../14/01.md). While the story that begins in [14:13](../14/13.md) is linked to the flashback by the phrase “Now having heard,” Matthew does not indicate how long it took for Jesus to hear about John’s death from John’s disciples. So, you should use a form that shows your readers that [14:3–12](../14/03.md) is a flashback that describes something that happened previously, and [14:13](../14/13.md) continues with the main narrative. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMost of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in dialogue between characters. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are singular. You should assume forms of “you” are singular unless a note specifies that the form is plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])
14:1	ny6u		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	ἐν ἐκείνῳ τῷ καιρῷ	1	Here, the phrase **At that time** introduces the next major event in the story. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the next event. Alternate translation: [While all those things were happening] or [During this period]
14:2	pd1b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	οὗτός	1	The pronoun **This** refers to Jesus. If this is not clear for your readers, you could refer to him more directly. Alternate translation: [This person] or [This Jesus]
14:2	nx7x		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	αὐτὸς ἠγέρθη	1	Here, the word **raised** refers to someone who died coming back back to life. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable idiom or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [He has been restored to life]
14:2	dy2j		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	αὐτὸς ἠγέρθη	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, Herod could be implying that: (1) God did it. Alternate translation: [God has raised him]; (2) John himself did it. Alternate translation: [He has risen]
14:2	wwe3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ἀπὸ τῶν νεκρῶν	1	Paul is using the adjective **dead** as a noun in order to refer to all people who are **dead**. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this with a noun phrase. Alternate translation: [from among the dead people] or [from the corpses]
14:2	x4zz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	διὰ τοῦτο	1	Here, the phrase **because of this** introduces the result of what Herod thinks about John being **raised from the dead**. Herod thinks that Jesus has **powers** because he has already **been raised from the dead**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: [because he has been raised,]
14:2	vve7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	αἱ δυνάμεις ἐνεργοῦσιν ἐν αὐτῷ	1	Here Herod speaks as if **the powers** were people that could **work** in Jesus. He means that Jesus is powerful and can do powerful things. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [he has his powers] or [he is very powerful]
14:3	ybyz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-background	γὰρ	1	The word **For** introduces background information that tells about how John died. This background information continues in [14:4–12](../14/04.md). In your translation, present this information in a way that makes it clear that this is background information, not the next event in the story. Alternate translation: [Now sometime earlier,] or [By this time, John had already died. Here is what happened:]
14:3	zsvz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ὁ & Ἡρῴδης κρατήσας τὸν Ἰωάννην, ἔδησεν αὐτὸν καὶ ἐν φυλακῇ ἀπέθετο, διὰ Ἡρῳδιάδα, τὴν γυναῖκα Φιλίππου, τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these elements, since the second half of the verse gives the reason for the result that the first half of the verse describes. Alternate translation: [Because of Herodias, the wife of his brother Philip, Herod, having seized John, bound him and put him in prison]
14:3	h466		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ὁ & Ἡρῴδης κρατήσας τὸν Ἰωάννην, ἔδησεν αὐτὸν καὶ ἐν φυλακῇ ἀπέθετο	1	Matthew implies that **Herod** sent his soldiers to do these things. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [Herod sent his soldiers to seize John, bind him, and put him in prison]
14:3	rqfw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	διὰ Ἡρῳδιάδα, τὴν γυναῖκα Φιλίππου, τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ	1	Matthew implies that Herod married **Herodias** after she divorced **Philip**, Herod’s brother. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [because of Herodias, whom he married after she divorced his brother Philip]
14:3	ftfc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-participants	Ἡρῳδιάδα, τὴν γυναῖκα Φιλίππου, τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ	1	Matthew introduces **Herodias** as a new participant in the story. If your language has its own way of introducing new participants, you could use it here in your translation. Alternate translation: [a woman named Herodias, who was the wife of his brother Philip]
14:3	lr92		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Φιλίππου	1	The word **Philip** is the name of a man.
14:3	tqyo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	τοῦ ἀδελφοῦ αὐτοῦ	1	It is not certain whether **Philip** was older or younger than **Herod**, but it is slightly more likely that he was older. So, if you have to use a form that refers to an older or younger **brother**, you could state that **Philip** was older. Alternate translation: [his older brother]
14:3	e6zc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτοῦ	1	The pronoun **his** refers to Herod. If this is not clear for your readers, you could use the person’s name here. Alternate translation: [Herod’s]

Alternate translation: [For John was saying to Herod, “It is not lawful for you to have Herodias, the wife of your brother Philip.” So, because of Herodias, Herod, having seized John, bound him and put him in prison.]
14:4	jpro		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a reason why Herod put John in prison. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a reason, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: [He did that because]
14:4	lp4d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτῷ	1	The pronoun **him** refers to Herod. If this is not clear for your readers, you could use the person’s name here. Alternate translation: [to Herod]

15:intro	i9a5				0	# Matthew 15 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n7. Further opposition to Jesus and misunderstanding of the kingdom of God ([13:53–17:27](../13/01.md))\n      * Argument with the Pharisees and scribes about washing hands ([15:1–9](../15/01.md))\n      * Jesus teaches about what defiles people ([15:10–20](../15/10.md))\n      * Jesus meets a Canaanite woman ([15:21–28](../15/21.md))\n      * Jesus heals many people ([15:29–31](../15/29.md))\n      * Jesus feeds 4,000 men ([15:32–39](../15/32.md))\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [15:8–9](../15/08.md), which is a quote from [Isaiah 29:13](../../isa/29/13.md).\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### The “tradition of the elders”\n\nThe “tradition of the elders” included interpretations of Moses’ law that Jewish religious leaders had developed and passed down to their disciples, and they to their disciples. These interpretations explained what specific laws meant and how to obey them. Jesus rebuked the religious leaders for specific interpretations of the law that he disagreed with. In this chapter, Jesus and the Pharisees argue about washing hands, honoring parents, and giving gifts to God. When you translate the phrase “tradition of the elders,” use a form that refers to teachings that teachers pass down to their students. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/tradition]] and [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/elder]])\n\n### Washing hands before eating\n\nIn [15:1](../15/01.md), the scribes and Pharisees rebuke Jesus for failing to have his disciples wash their hands before eating. One of the traditions that the Pharisees followed was a requirement that people wash their hands before eating. They did this to make their hands ceremonially clean, not primarily to clean off dirt. Make sure that your translation indicates that Jesus and the Pharisees are debating about ceremonial or ritual washing, not washing off dirt.\n\n### The gift for God\n\nIn [15:4–6](../15/04.md), Jesus rebukes the Pharisees for allowing people to promise to give something to God instead of using it to help their parents. Jesus is not saying that giving things to God is wrong. Instead, he is saying that honoring one’s parents is one of the most important commandments that God gave, and no tradition should prevent people from honoring their parents. Make sure that this meaning is clear in your translation.\n\n### The Canaanite woman\n\nMatthew describes the woman as a “Canaanite,” which is an old term for the people who lived in the land of Israel before the Israelites arrived. Matthew means that the woman is not a Jew, and he might mean that she is descended from the people that the Israelites defeated when they took over the land of Israel. Your translation should make clearly indicate that the woman is not a Jew. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/names/canaan]])\n\n### The miracle of multiplying food\n\nIn [15:32–39](../15/32.md), Matthew tells a story in which Jesus provides 4,000 men and even more women and children with food. All these people were in a place where no people lived, and all the food that Jesus and his disciples had were seven loaves of bread and a few fish. Despite that, Jesus used the seven loaves of bread and the few fish to feed everyone who was there. Matthew does not tell us exactly how Jesus did this, but he does say that there were more leftovers than what they started with. Your translation should not explain how Jesus multiplied the food, but it should be clear that he did a miracle. Matthew told a similar story about how Jesus fed 5,000 men in [14:13–21](../14/13.md), so see how you expressed the ideas there.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Feeding little dogs\n\nIn [15:26](../15/26.md), Jesus tells the Canaanite woman that it is not right to give food that is meant for children to little dogs. In [15:27](../15/27.md), the woman responds that little dogs eat the little bits of food that fall off their owners’ tables. The children represent Jews, and the little dogs represent non-Jews. The food represents things that Jesus does for people. What Jesus means is that he is supposed to do things for Jews, not for non-Jews. What the woman means is that what she is asking Jesus to do is unimportant enough that he can do it without taking away from what he does for Jews. If possible, do not express the meaning of what Jesus and the woman say about little dogs, but make sure that your translation naturally expresses this meaning.\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMany of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in speeches that Jesus gives to the Pharisees, the crowds, or the disciples. Because of this, the majority of forms of “you” in this chapter are plural. You should assume forms of “you” are plural unless a note specifies that the form is singular.

16:intro	za2k				0	# Matthew 16 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n7. Further opposition to Jesus and misunderstanding of the kingdom of God ([13:53–17:27](../13/01.md))\n      * The Pharisees and Sadducees test Jesus ([16:1–4](../16/01.md))\n      * The yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees ([16:5–12](../16/05.md))\n      * Who Jesus really is ([16:13–20](../16/13.md))\n      * What Jesus and his disciples must do ([16:21–28](../16/21.md))\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### The sign of Jonah\n\nIn [16:4](../16/04.md), Jesus briefly refers to “the sign of Jonah.” He has already discussed this sign in more detail in [12:39–41](../12/39.md). See the introduction to [chapter 12](../12/01.md) for more information. Express the idea here as you did there. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/names/jonah]])\n\n### Peter, “this rock,” and the keys of the kingdom\n\nIn [16:18–19](../16/18.md), Jesus tells Peter that he is a rock on which the church will be built and that he has been given the keys to the kingdom of the heavens. It is clear is that Peter is very important for God’s kingdom. However, Christians debate in what way Peter is important. Some think that Peter is primarily important because of what he confessed about Jesus. Others think that Peter and his successors have authority over the church. Others think that Peter himself had authority over the early church but that he did not have any successors. If possible, express the idea in a general way but so that it is clear that Peter supports the church and has some kind of authority.\n\n### The coming of the Son of Man\n\nIn [16:27–28](../16/27.md), Jesus twice refers to how he, the Son of Man, will “come.” The first time (in [16:27](../16/27.md)), Jesus speaks about coming in glory with his angels. In this case, he is almost certainly referring to his second coming, when he will punish or reward everyone for what they have done.\n\nThe second time he refers to his “coming” (in [16:28](../16/28.md)), Jesus speaks about coming “in his kingdom.” Christians debate what he could be referring to. It could be:\n\n1. Jesus’ transfiguration, which Matthew narrates in [17:1–8](../17/01.md)\n2. Jesus’ resurrection and enthronement in heaven\n3. the empowerment and growth of the church\n4. the destruction of Jerusalem\n5. Jesus’ second coming\n6. several of these options together\n\nSince Christians have understood this verse in at least these different ways, if possible your translation should allow for all these options. See the notes on [16:28](../16/28.md) for translation options.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### The yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees\n\nIn [16:5–12](../16/05.md), Jesus tells his disciples to guard themselves from the “yeast” of the Pharisees and Sadducees. The disciples misunderstand him and think that he is saying something about bread, which they forgot to bring with them. Jesus reminds them that he is not talking about lack of bread, since he has proved twice that he can multiply food. When he repeats that they should guard themselves from the “yeast” of the Pharisees and Sadducees, the disciples realize that Jesus is speaking figuratively about what the Pharisees and Sadducees teach. Since the disciples misunderstanding “yeast” is an important part of this passage, you should not explain what “yeast” means when Jesus uses the word. However, make sure that it is clear that “yeast” refers to teachings when Matthew explains the metaphor in [16:12](../16/12.md). (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### “This rock” and the name Peter\n\nIn [16:18](../16/18.md), Jesus tells Peter that his name is “Peter.” Jesus does this because he wants to comment on what the name “Peter” means, which is “rock.” After saying the name “Peter,” Jesus says that he will build his church “on this rock,” which refers back to the name “Peter.” Consider how you might naturally explain what the name “Peter” means so that your readers understand what Jesus means when he speaks about “this rock.” You could consider using a footnote or explaining the name in the translation itself.\n\n### The keys of the kingdom\n\nIn [16:19](../16/19.md), Jesus promises that he will give “the keys of the kingdom of the heavens” to Peter. This could mean that Peter will control who enters the kingdom and who does not enter the kingdom. Or, it could mean that Peter has a position of authority within the kingdom. Since Christians debate exactly what the “keys” mean, if possible you should preserve the metaphor or express the idea in a general way. See the notes on the verse for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMany of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in speeches that Jesus gives to the disciples. Because of this, the majority of forms of “you” in this chapter are plural. You should assume forms of “you” are plural unless a note specifies that the form is singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### Verses 2b–3\n\nSome of the earliest manuscripts do not include anything for [16:2b–3](../16/02.md). Since the earliest manuscripts do not include these words, the ULT and UST put them in brackets. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT and omit these words. If it would be helpful, you could put the words in brackets or in a footnote.

16:26	g0xo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἄνθρωπος & κερδήσῃ & αὐτοῦ & ἄνθρωπος & αὐτοῦ	1	Although the terms **man**, **he**, and **his** are masculine, Jesus is using the words in a generic sense that includes both men and women.

Alternate translation: [a man can give nothing in exchange for his life.] or [a man cannot give anything in exchange for his life!]
16:26	ot67		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀντάλλαγμα τῆς ψυχῆς αὐτοῦ	1	Here Jesus could be implying: (1) that there is nothing that is worth as much as a person’s **life**.

16:27	t2ho		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	ἐν τῇ δόξῃ τοῦ Πατρὸς αὐτοῦ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **glory**, you could express the same idea in another way.

16:27	vk5y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	τοῦ Πατρὸς αὐτοῦ	1	**Father** is an important title that describes the relationship between God the Father and Jesus the Son.

16:28	gfwc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐ μὴ	1	The words translated as **certainly not** are two negative words. In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: [by no means]

If possible, express the idea in such a way that most or all of these interpretations are possible. Alternate translation: [acting as king in his kingdom] or [taking charge of his kingdom]
17:intro	yb4k				0	# Matthew 17 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n7. Further opposition to Jesus and misunderstanding of the kingdom of God ([13:53–17:27](../13/01.md))\n      * Jesus is transfigured ([17:1–8](../17/01.md))\n      * The disciples ask about Elijah ([17:9–13](../17/09.md))\n      * Jesus heals an epileptic boy ([17:14–21](../17/14.md))\n      * Jesus predicts his suffering and death ([17:22–23](../17/22.md))\n      * The two-drachma tax ([17:24–27](../17/24.md))\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### “transfigured”\n\nIn [17:1–8](../17/01.md), Matthew describes how Jesus was “transfigured.” This word indicates that Jesus looked very different to the disciples. Matthew does not tell us all the ways in which Jesus looked different, but he does say that Jesus’ face “shone as the sun” and that his clothes became very white. What this means is that the disciples were able to see some of the glory and majesty that Jesus has as God’s Son. Make sure that your translation shows that Jesus looked great and glorious.\n\n### Elijah\n\nWhen Jesus was transfigured, the disciples saw Moses and Elijah talking with him. Later, they ask Jesus about Elijah. They refer specifically to what the scribes say about a prophecy in [Malachi 4:5–6](../../mal/04/05.md), which indicates that God will send “Elijah” to prepare the way before God comes to judge his enemies and reward his people. Malachi is referring to a prophet who lived even earlier. This prophet, named Elijah, performed many miracles and spoke messages from God (see [1 Kings 17–19](../../1ki/17/01.md) and [2 Kings 2:1–17](../../2ki/02/01.md)). The disciples ask about whether this Elijah is supposed to come before the Messiah does. Jesus says that this is true, and he talks about this “Elijah” in a way that shows the disciples that John the Baptist was “Elijah.” He means that John fulfills the prophecy in Malachi that someone like the prophet Elijah will prepare the way before God comes to judge and reward people. If your readers would not know the prophecy in Malachi or the stories about the prophet Elijah, you may need to include some of this information in your translation or in a footnote. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/names/elijah]])\n\n### The epileptic boy\n\nIn [17:14–21](../17/14.md), Matthew tells a story about how Jesus healed a boy. Matthew first describes this boy as an “epileptic,” which refers to a disease that causes people to pass out and move uncontrollably. Later on, however, Matthew makes it clear that a demon is causing the boy’s sickness. You should only make this clear when Matthew does. See the notes on these verses for ways to refer to the disease and how to introduce the demon.\n\n### The two-drachma tax\n\nDuring this time period, Jewish men were expected to pay a tax of two drachmas to the leaders, who would use the money to keep the Jewish temple operating properly. A drachma was about a day’s wages for a hired worker. When Jesus told Peter how to pay the tax, he said that he would find a coin worth four drachmas (a shekel) in the mouth of a fish he would catch. This coin would be enough to pay both Peter’s and Jesus’ taxes. You could include some of this information in your translation or in a footnote.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMany of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in speeches that Jesus gives to the disciples. Because of this, the majority of forms of “you” in this chapter are plural. You should assume forms of “you” are plural unless a note specifies that the form is singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### Verse 21\n\nSome of the earliest manuscripts do not include anything for [17:21](../17/21.md). Some early manuscripts and many later manuscripts include the following words: “But this kind does not go out except by prayer and fasting.” Since the earliest manuscripts do not include these words, the ULT and UST include these words in brackets. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to omit these words. If it would be helpful, you could put the words in brackets or in a footnote. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
17:1	u6dw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	καὶ μεθ’ ἡμέρας ἓξ	1	Here, the phrase **And after six days** introduces the next major event in the story.

17:1	x4sj		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	παραλαμβάνει & ἀναφέρει αὐτοὺς	1	To call attention to a development in the story, Matthew uses the present tense in past narration. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: [took along … brought them up]
17:1	f2yy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-kinship	τὸν ἀδελφὸν αὐτοῦ	1	Matthew never says whether **James** or **John** was older, but he mentions **James** first, which could imply that he was the older brother. If you have to use a form that refers to an older or younger brother, you could state that **John** was younger. Alternate translation: [his younger brother]
17:2	lvdq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	μετεμορφώθη	1	The word **transfigured** means to be changed in appearance or form.

17:2	kq4l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	μετεμορφώθη	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

17:3	kpdg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	The word **behold** draws the attention of the audience and asks them to listen carefully.

Alternate translation: [listen] or [suddenly]
17:3	d8i7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὤφθη αὐτοῖς Μωϋσῆς καὶ Ἠλείας	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [they saw Moses and Elijah]

17:4	xxfg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀποκριθεὶς	1	Here, the word **answering** indicates that Peter was responding to what he saw. He was not answering a question.

17:4	r41c		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	ἡμᾶς	1	By **we**, Peter could mean: (1) everyone who was there, including himself, the other two disciples, Jesus, Moses, and Elijah. Alternate translation: [for us all]; (2) just himself and the other two disciples. Alternate translation: [for us disciples]
17:4	wmax		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	θέλεις & σοὶ	1	Since Peter is talking to Jesus, the word **you** is singular throughout this verse.
17:4	glxv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	ποιήσω	1	Many ancient manuscripts read **I will make**. The ULT follows that reading. Other ancient manuscripts read “let us make.” If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
17:4	d231		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	σκηνάς	1	The term **tents** means simple, temporary places in which to sit or sleep. Peter probably had in mind that he would build them from the materials available on the mountain such as tree branches.

17:5	w8va		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	-1	In both places, the word **behold** draws the attention of the audience and asks them to listen carefully.

Alternate translation: [it happened … then] or [suddenly … listen]
17:5	qxz1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	νεφέλη φωτεινὴ	-1	Here, a **bright cloud** is one that is white and reflects the light from the sun very strongly.

17:5	wwux		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτούς	1	The pronoun **them** could refer to: (1) the three disciples, Jesus, Moses, and Elijah. Alternate translation: [them all]; (2) just Jesus, Moses, and Elijah. Alternate translation: [Jesus, Moses, and Elijah]
17:5	kc8t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	φωνὴ	1	Matthew is using **voice** to represent the person who is speaking, which is God the Father.

17:6	vpfp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-time-sequential	οἱ μαθηταὶ ἔπεσαν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον αὐτῶν καὶ ἐφοβήθησαν σφόδρα	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these two clauses, since the second clause describes something that happened before what the first clause describes. Alternate translation: [the disciples were very afraid and fell on their face]
17:6	a87e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἔπεσαν ἐπὶ πρόσωπον αὐτῶν	1	In Matthew’s culture, “falling” on one’s **face** refers to kneeling down and putting one’s face close to the ground.

This prophecy states that God will send Elijah before the day of the Lord arrives, and he will prepare people. Elijah was a prophet who did many powerful things a long time before Malachi wrote down this prophecy. The **scribes** teach that this means that **Elijah** must come before the Messiah does.

Alternate translation: [it is necessary for Elijah, who was a prophet long ago, to come] or [the Scriptures indicate that it is necessary for Elijah the prophet to come]

17:27	sz8z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	αὐτούς & αὐτοῖς	1	The pronoun **them** in both places refers to the people who were collecting taxes. If this is not clear for your readers, you could refer to these people more directly. Alternate translation: [the ones collecting the tax … to the ones collecting the tax] or [the tax collectors … to the tax collectors]
17:27	t3uy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-go	πορευθεὶς	1	In a context such as this, your language might say “come” instead of **gone**. Alternate translation: [having come]
17:27	fzkh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	βάλε & ἆρον & εὑρήσεις & δὸς & σοῦ	1	Because Jesus is speaking to Peter, the commands and the word **you** throughout this verse are singular.
17:27	uhk5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	βάλε ἄγκιστρον	1	A **fishhook** is a small, sharp, curved object that fishermen would tie to the end of a rope or line in order to hook and catch fish. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of fishing implement, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could refer more generally to fishing. Alternate translation: [cast your line] or [go fishing]
17:27	w0ib		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸν ἀναβάντα πρῶτον ἰχθὺν ἆρον	1	Here Jesus means that Peter should take the first fish that he catches with his **fishhook**. The fish would need to **come up** from further down in the water to be caught on the hook. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [take the first fish that you catch]
17:27	t9t8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney	στατῆρα	1	A **shekel** was a silver coin equivalent to about four drachmas (see [17:24](../17/24.md)), that is, about four days’ wages. You could try to express this amount in terms of current monetary values, but that might cause your Bible translation to become outdated and inaccurate since those values can change over time. So instead, you might state something more general or give the equivalent in wages. Alternate translation: [a four-drachma coin] or [a coin worth four days’ wages]
17:27	km3v		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀντὶ ἐμοῦ καὶ σοῦ	1	Here Jesus means that this coin will pay for both his and Peter’s two-drachma tax. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [as payment for my tax and your tax]
18:intro	m4y6				0	# Matthew 18 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n8. Jesus teaches about life in the kingdom of God ([18:1–35](../18/01.md))\n      * The disciples ask about who is the greatest ([18:1–5](../18/01.md))\n      * Jesus teaches about stumbling blocks ([18:6–9](../18/06.md))\n      * The parable of the lost sheep ([18:10–14](../18/10.md))\n      * Jesus teaches about a sinning brother ([18:15–20](../18/15.md))\n      * The parable of the unforgiving slave ([18:21–35](../18/21.md))\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### The “little ones”\n\nIn [18:6](../18/06.md), [18:10](../18/10.md), and [18:14](../18/14.md), Jesus refers to people whom he calls “little ones.” In the previous paragraph, he told the disciples that they needed to be like little children if they wanted to be great in the kingdom of the heavens. Because of this, it is possible that Jesus uses the phrase “little ones” to continue to refer to children. However, it is also possible that he uses the phrase to refer to people who are like little children in some specific way. They could be like little children either because they are insignificant or unimportant or because they are immature in their faith. If possible, express the idea in such a way that all of these interpretations are possible. If you must make the idea more explicit, it is recommended that you refer to insignificant or unimportant people. That is how Jesus used the phrase in [10:42](../10/42.md).\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Stumbling and stumbling blocks\n\nIn [18:6–9](../18/06.md), Jesus discusses “stumbling blocks” and things that cause stumbling. He uses these terms to refer to people and things that cause people to sin. See the notes on these verses for translation options.\n\n### Hyperbole\n\nIn [18:8–9](../18/08.md), Jesus commands his disciples to cut off or pluck out body parts that cause them to sin. He uses this extreme example of resisting sin in order to show his disciples how serious sin really is. He does not mean that believers should always cut off body parts when they sin. Jesus intends his commands to be shocking, however, so you should preserve the extreme language. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that indicates that Jesus’ commands are extreme language. There are very similar verses in [5:29–30](../05/29.md), so you translate as you did there.\n\n### The parable of the lost sheep\n\nIn [18:12–14](../18/12.md), Jesus tells a story about a shepherd who had 100 sheep. When one of the sheep went astray, the shepherd left the other sheep behind to find it. When he found it, he was happier about that one sheep than he was about the 99 sheep that had not gone astray. Jesus applies this story to God the Father, who does not want any person to perish. Just like the shepherd, God will rescue people who go astray and rejoice when they are rescued. Your translation should not directly explain the meaning of this parable more than Jesus does. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])\n\n### The parable of the unforgiving slave\n\nIn [18:23–35](../18/23.md), Jesus tells a story about a slave who owed an enormous debt to his master, the king. When the slave begs the king to be patient with him, the king forgives the entire debt. However, the slave immediately finds another slave who owes him a small amount of money. He demands that the slave pay him immediately and does not forgive the debt. When the king finds out about this, he has the first slave jailed and tortured until he can pay the enormous debt. Jesus applies this story to believers who do not forgive fellow believers. God will punish them, just as the king punished the slave who did not have mercy on his fellow slave. Your translation should not directly explain the meaning of this parable more than Jesus does. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMost of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in instructions that Jesus gives to individual disciples or in dialogues between individual people. Because of this, the majority of forms of “you” in this chapter are singular. You should assume forms of “you” are singular unless a note specifies that the form is plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### Verse 11\n\nSome of the earliest manuscripts do not include anything for [18:11](../18/11.md). Some early manuscripts and many later manuscripts include the following words: “For the Son of Man came to save the one that had been lost.” Since the earliest manuscripts do not include these words, the ULT and UST include these words in brackets. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to omit these words. If it would be helpful, you could put the words in brackets or in a footnote. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])
18:1	f7zv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-newevent	ἐν ἐκείνῃ τῇ ὥρᾳ	1	Here, the phrase **At that hour** introduces the next major event in the story. The phrase clarifies that this new event happened immediately after the previous event. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces the next event that happened immediately after the previous one. Alternate translation: [Right after that,]
18:1	u4f7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	λέγοντες	1	Consider natural ways of introducing direct quotations in your language. Alternate translation: [and they said]
18:1	pp31		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	τίς ἄρα	1	Here, the word **then** could: (1) indicate that the disciples are asking the question because of something that just happened. That could be Jesus implying that the disciples are important enough to be exempt from paying taxes, or it could be Jesus singling out Peter as an important disciple, or it could be something else that the disciples have experienced. Alternate translation: [Because of what just happened, we want to ask this: Who]; (2) make the question stronger or more urgent. Alternate translation: [Who is it who] or [Tell us! Who]
18:2	nj00		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	προσκαλεσάμενος παιδίον, ἔστησεν	1	It may be more natural in your language to have a direct quotation here. Alternate translation: [having said to a little child, “Come here,” he set]
18:2	cdgb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	αὐτὸ	1	Here the word translated as **him** refers to the child without identifying whether the child was male or female. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that makes this clear. Alternate translation: [this child]
18:3	fs1e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions	ἐὰν μὴ στραφῆτε καὶ γένησθε ὡς τὰ παιδία, οὐ μὴ εἰσέλθητε εἰς τὴν Βασιλείαν τῶν Οὐρανῶν	1	If, in your language, it would appear that Jesus was contradicting a statement that he was about to make, you could reword this to avoid using an exception clause. Alternate translation: [you will only enter into the kingdom of the heavens if you turn and become like little children]
18:3	diz4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	ὑμῖν & στραφῆτε & οὐ μὴ εἰσέλθητε	1	Throughout this verse, the word **you** is plural because Jesus is speaking to his disciples.
18:3	tsyb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	στραφῆτε	1	Here Jesus is speaking of changing one’s attitude and behavior as if it were physically turning. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [you change your attitude] or [you act differently]
18:3	w9c6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ γένησθε	1	Here, the word **and** introduces the goal for which the disciples should **turn**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces a goal. Alternate translation: [in order to become]
18:3	ewj5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	γένησθε ὡς τὰ παιδία	1	Jesus is saying that his disciples should be like **little children** because **little children** are humble. Jesus clarifies this meaning in the following verse, so if possible you should not state this explicitly here. Alternate translation: [act as little children do]
18:3	h9w4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐ μὴ	1	The words translated as **certainly not** are two negative words. In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: [by no means]
18:4	hb1p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	οὖν	1	Here, the word **Therefore** introduces Jesus’ application of what he said in [18:3](../18/03.md) to what the disciples asked him about who was the greatest. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces this kind of application. Alternate translation: [Here is what that means:] or [Consequently]
18:4	rw2n		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	ἑαυτὸν & οὗτός	1	Although the terms **himself** and **he** are masculine, Jesus is using the words in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that makes this clear. Alternate translation: [himself or herself … that person] or [himself or herself … he or she]
18:4	ta7z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ταπεινώσει ἑαυτὸν ὡς τὸ παιδίον τοῦτο	1	Jesus is saying that people should humble themselves like **this little child** because the **little child** is humble. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: [will make himself as humble as this little child is humble] or [will humble himself with the result that he is as humble as this little child]
18:4	tdk0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸ παιδίον τοῦτο	1	Here, the phrase **this little child** refers back to the child whom Jesus set in their midst (see [18:2](../18/02.md)). You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [this little child who is in our midst] or [this little child whom I summoned]
18:4	gf8l		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	ὁ μείζων	1	Jesus is using the adjective **greatest** as a noun to mean the greatest person. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: [the greatest person]
18:5	v4a2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ὃς ἐὰν δέξηται ἓν παιδίον τοιοῦτο ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματί μου, ἐμὲ δέχεται	1	Here Jesus speaks as if people who receive **a little child like this** were actually receiving him. He means that these people, by receiving the **little child**, show that they would receive Jesus too. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in simile form or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [whoever receives a little child like this in my name, it is as if he or she received me] or [whoever receives a little child like this in my name proves that he or she would receive me]
18:5	i9ju		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἓν παιδίον τοιοῦτο	1	Here Jesus is again referring to the **little child** whom he set in their midst (see [18:2](../18/02.md)). You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [a little child like the one standing here] or [a little child, like this one that I summoned,]
18:5	dz1i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ἐπὶ τῷ ὀνόματί μου	1	Here, the phrase **in my name** could mean that: (1) the person **receives a little child** because the person follows Jesus. Alternate translation: [because that person is acting as my disciple]; (2) the person **receives the little child** because the **little child** follows Jesus. Alternate translation: [because the child is my disciple]
18:6	dxd2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	σκανδαλίσῃ ἕνα τῶν μικρῶν τούτων τῶν πιστευόντων εἰς ἐμέ	1	Here, Jesus is speaking of sinning as if it were stumbling. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin]
18:6	ehqp		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἕνα τῶν μικρῶν τούτων τῶν πιστευόντων εἰς ἐμέ	1	The phrase **these little ones** could refer: (1) to people who are not important from a human perspective. Alternate translation: [one of these unimportant people who believe in me]; (2) to children who love Jesus and who are physically **little** compared to adults. Alternate translation: [one of these children who believe in me]; (3) to people whose faith is new and has not yet become mature and strong. Alternate translation: [one of these people who recently believed in me]
18:6	z9dw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	συμφέρει αὐτῷ ἵνα	1	Here Jesus implies that what he is about to describe is **better** than being punished by God for causing **one of these little ones** to sin. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [rather than being punished by God for doing that, it is better for him that]
18:6	q50w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	αὐτῷ & αὐτοῦ & καταποντισθῇ	1	Although the terms **him**, **his**, and **he** are masculine, Jesus is using the words in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that makes this clear. Alternate translation: [for that person … his or her … he or she would have been sunk]
18:6	ghp3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἵνα κρεμασθῇ μύλος ὀνικὸς περὶ τὸν τράχηλον αὐτοῦ, καὶ καταποντισθῇ ἐν τῷ πελάγει τῆς θαλάσσης	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, you could use an indefinite subject. Alternate translation: [that people might hang a millstone of a donkey around his neck and make him sink into the depth of the sea]
18:6	w3uz		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	μύλος ὀνικὸς	1	A **millstone** was a round stone used for grinding grain into flour. The phrase **of a donkey** indicates that this kind of **millstone** was heavy enough that it took a **donkey** to turn it. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of stone, you could use the name of something similar in your area, or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: [a very large rock] or [a very heavy object]
18:6	k8ec		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	κρεμασθῇ & περὶ τὸν τράχηλον αὐτοῦ	1	The implication is that someone would tie the **millstone** around the person’s neck. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [would have been attached to his neck]
18:6	vs96		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	τῷ πελάγει τῆς θαλάσσης	1	Here, the phrase **the depth of the sea** refers to the parts of a body of water that are deep and far away from land. If your readers would not be familiar with what this phrase describes, you could use the name of something similar in your area, or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: [deep water] or [the parts of the sea that are far from land]
18:6	ihfv		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	τῷ πελάγει	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **depth**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [the deep parts]
18:7	hlmd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	οὐαὶ τῷ κόσμῳ & οὐαὶ τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ	1	The phrases **Woe to the world** and **woe to the man** are the opposite of blessing **the world** and **the man**. The phrases indicate that bad things are going to happen to the people being addressed. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [How bad it is for the world … how bad it is for the man] or [Trouble will come to the world … trouble will come to the man]
18:7	ees6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	τῷ κόσμῳ	1	Here, the word **world** refers primarily to the people who live in the world. If it would be helpful in your language, you could refer specifically to people here. Alternate translation: [to the people living in the world] or [to people]

18:7	jtei		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	Here, the word **For** introduces a further explanation about **the stumbling blocks**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a word or phrase that introduces an explanation, or you could leave **For** untranslated. Alternate translation: [Here is what I mean:] or [Further,]
18:7	lfnd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ & τὸ σκάνδαλον	1	The words **man** and **stumbling block** represent men and stumbling blocks in general, not one particular man or stumbling block. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: [to any man … a stumbling block]
18:7	vg5f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τῷ ἀνθρώπῳ	1	Although the term **man** is masculine, Jesus is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women.

18:8	vad7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	εἰ & ἡ χείρ σου ἢ ὁ πούς σου σκανδαλίζει σε	1	Jesus is suggesting that this is a hypothetical condition, that the disciples might experience their **hand** or **foot** causing them **to stumble**. Use a natural form in your language for introducing a situation that could happen. See how you translated the similar clauses in [5:29–30](../05/29.md). Alternate translation: [consider this situation: your hand or foot causes you to stumble. If that were to happen]
18:8	mr24		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	ἡ χείρ σου ἢ ὁ πούς σου σκανδαλίζει σε	1	Here, Jesus speaks of **your hand** and **your foot** as if they were people who could cause **you to stumble**. He means that the **hand** or the **foot** is the part of the body that is involved in the stumbling. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [it is your hand’s or your foot’s fault that you stumble] or [you stumble with your hand or your foot]
18:8	qxou		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd	σου & σου & σε & σοῦ & σοί	1	Even though Jesus is speaking to many disciples, he is addressing an individual situation, so **you** and **your** are singular throughout this verse. But if the singular form would not be natural in your language for someone who was speaking to a group of people, you could use the plural forms of **you** and **your** in your translation. If you do so, you may also need to make some other words plural.
18:8	rios		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	σκανδαλίζει σε	1	Here Jesus is speaking of sinning as if it were stumbling. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [causes you to sin]
18:8	gqi3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ἔκκοψον αὐτὸν καὶ βάλε ἀπὸ σοῦ	1	Here Jesus provides the most extreme response to sinning. He does not mean that this should be the normal way to deal with sin. You should preserve the extreme language Jesus uses, but use a form that indicates that this is the most extreme example. See how you translated the similar constructions in [5:29–30](../05/29.md). Alternate translation: [if necessary, you should even cut it off and throw it away from you!]
18:8	bozd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὴν ζωὴν	1	Here Jesus speaks as if **life** were a house into which someone could **enter**.

18:8	g9rh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	εἰσελθεῖν εἰς τὴν ζωὴν	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **life**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [to be able to live]
18:8	pc4d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὴν ζωὴν	1	Here Jesus implies that this **life** is everlasting or undying life. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this idea more explicit. Alternate translation: [true life] or [everlasting life]
18:8	lhk9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	βληθῆναι	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who did the action, it is clear from the context that it was God. Alternate translation: [for God to throw you]
18:8	w0sr		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τὸ πῦρ τὸ αἰώνιον	1	Here, the phrase **the eternal fire** refers to hell and describes at as a very unpleasant place. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in simile form or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [hell, which is as hot as an eternal fire] or [hell]
18:9	nv26		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-condition-hypothetical	εἰ ὁ ὀφθαλμός σου σκανδαλίζει σε	1	Jesus is suggesting that this is a hypothetical condition, that the disciples might experience their **eye** causing them **to stumble**.

Alternate translation: [consider this situation: your eye causes you to stumble. If that were to happen]
18:9	xruf		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	ὁ ὀφθαλμός σου σκανδαλίζει σε	1	Here, Jesus speaks of **your eye** as if it were a person who could cause **you to stumble**. He means that the **eye** is the part of the body that is involved in the stumbling. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. See how you translated the similar clause in [18:8](../18/08.md). Alternate translation: [it is your eye’s fault that you stumble] or [you stumble with your eye]
18:9	l4qy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-youcrowd	σου & σε & σοῦ & σοί	1	Even though Jesus is speaking to many disciples, he is addressing an individual situation, so **you** and **your** are singular throughout this verse. But if the singular form would not be natural in your language for someone who was speaking to a group of people, you could use the plural forms of **you** and **your** in your translation. If you do so, you may also need to make some other words plural.
18:9	q7tw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	σκανδαλίζει σε	1	Here Jesus is speaking of sinning as if it were stumbling. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. See how you translated this phrase in [18:8](../18/08.md). Alternate translation: [causes you to sin]
18:9	xad4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	ἔξελε αὐτὸν καὶ βάλε ἀπὸ σοῦ	1	Here Jesus provides the most extreme response to sinning.

19:intro	ewl5				0	# Matthew 19 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n9. Jesus ministers in Judea ([19:1–22:46](../19/01.md))\n      * Jesus goes to Judea ([19:1–2](../19/01.md))\n      * Jesus teaches about marriage and divorce ([19:3–12](../19/03.md))\n      * Jesus blesses little children ([19:13–15](../19/13.md))\n      * Jesus talks with a young man ([19:16–22](../19/16.md))\n      * Jesus teaches about wealth, possessions, and the kingdom ([19:23–30](../19/23.md))\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Divorce\n\nIn [19:3](../19/03.md), the Pharisees test Jesus by asking him about divorce, an issue that was controversial among Jewish religious leaders. More specifically, the religious leaders argued about what were acceptable grounds for a divorce, so they asked Jesus about this. Jesus responds that divorce is never what God wants, and he quotes from [Genesis 1](../../gen/01/01.md) and 2 to prove this. In response, the Pharisees refer to [Deuteronomy 24:1–4](../../deu/24/01.md), which assumes that men do divorce their wives. Jesus replies that this section of the law exists only because the Israelites were stubborn. He means that God knew that the Israelite men would sometimes divorce their wives, so he included a law about how to do it. Jesus then states that the only acceptable ground for a divorce is sexual immorality. He further says that any divorced person who marries again is involved in adultery. Make sure that it is clear that both Jesus and the Pharisees are making arguments based on the Scriptures.\n\n### Eunuchs\n\nThe word “eunuch” refers to a man who is unable to reproduce. People in Jesus’ culture knew about two types of eunuchs:\n\n1. Some eunuchs were men who underwent a surgery in which parts of their genitals were removed. This kept them from being able to reproduce. These eunuchs were often important servants of kings and rulers, often serving in the harem.\n2. Some eunuchs were men who were born with genitals that were already unable to reproduce.\n\nIn [19:12](../19/12.md), Jesus refers to both of these kinds of eunuchs. Then he refers to “eunuchs who made themselves eunuchs because of the kingdom of the heavens.” Here he is referring to people who live like eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom. Consider how you might naturally refer to “eunuchs” in your language.\n\n### Rich people and the kingdom of the heavens\n\nIn Jesus’ culture, many people thought that rich people had been specifically blessed by God. When Jesus said that it was extremely difficult for rich people to enter God’s kingdom (see [19:23–24](../19/23.md)), the disciples were shocked. They thought that if it was hard for rich people to enter the kingdom, it would be impossible for everyone else. That is why they ask the question, “Who then is able to be saved?” ([19:25](../19/25.md)). If your readers might not understand why the disciples respond in this way, you may need to include a footnote that explains some of this information.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMany of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear when Jesus is speaking to the Pharisees or to his disciples. This means that Jesus frequently uses plural forms of “you.” In this chapter, you should assume that forms of “you” are plural unless a note specifies that the form is singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### Seventy-seven or seventy times seven\n\nThe Greek expression that the ULT translates in [18:22](../18/22.md) as “77” could also be translated as “70 times 7.” If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.

19:9	eq8z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	πορνείᾳ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea behind **immorality**, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: [what is sexually immoral] or [sexually immoral behavior]

20:intro	z39h				0	# Matthew 20 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n9. Jesus ministers in Judea ([19:1–22:46](../19/01.md))\n      * The parable of the denarius wage ([20:1–16](../20/01.md))\n      * Jesus predicts his death and resurrection ([20:17–19](../20/17.md))\n      * Jesus and the disciples speak about who will be great ([20:20–28](../20/20.md))\n      * Jesus heals two blind men ([20:29–34](../20/29.md))\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Hiring people to work in a vineyard\n\nIn [20:1–7](../20/01.md), Jesus speaks about a master of a house hiring people to work in his vineyard. These people were day laborers who would wait in the marketplace for someone to offer them a job. Then, they would agree with the person hiring them on how much money they would make before starting the job. If this is not a practice that your readers would be familiar with, make sure that what is happening is clear to your readers.\n\n### Sitting at Jesus’ right and left hand\n\nIn [20:21](../20/21.md) and [20:23](../20/23.md), Jesus and the mother of the sons of Zebedee refer to sitting at Jesus’ right hand and at his left hand. They are referring to the places of honor at the right and left side of a king or ruler. The people who sit in these places have authority and are respected the most after the king or ruler. Make sure that this meaning is clear in your translation. See the notes on these two verses for translation options.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### The parable of the denarius wage\n\nIn [20:1–15](../20/01.md), Jesus tells a story about a master of a house who hires people throughout the day to work in his vineyard. He agrees with the first people he hires to pay them a denarius each. However, when he pays everyone at the end of the day, he pays each worker a denarius, even those who only worked for one hour. When the workers who were hired first complain about this, he points out that he can do what he wants with his own money, and they agreed to work for one denarius each. Jesus uses this story to illustrate the point he makes before ([19:30](../19/30.md)) and after ([20:16](../20/16.md)) the story: people who are first will be last, and people who are last will be first. What Jesus means is that the rewards and blessings people receive do not always match what people expect, and God can do whatever he wants with the blessings and rewards he gives. While you should not explain the meaning more than Jesus does, make sure that your translation fits with what Jesus is illustrating. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])\n\n### Drinking the cup\n\nIn [20:22–23](../20/22.md), Jesus refers to a “cup” from which he is going to drink. He is referring to a figure of speech in the Old Testament that refers to experiencing suffering and pain (for example, see [Psalm 75:8](../../psa/075/008.md) and [Isaiah 51:17](../../isa/51/17.md)). He means that he will experience suffering, and his disciples must be ready to experience it as well. Since this figure of speech is from the Old Testament, if possible you should preserve it or express the idea in simile form. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMany of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in instructions that Jesus gives to his disciples or in speeches that the master of the house gives in the parable. Because of this, many of the forms of “you” in this chapter are plural. You should assume forms of “you” are plural unless a note specifies that the form is singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])

21:intro	ni1x				0	# Matthew 21 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n9. Jesus ministers in Judea ([19:1–22:46](../19/01.md))\n      * Jesus enters Jerusalem ([21:1–11](../21/01.md))\n      * Jesus drives people out of the temple and argues with the leaders ([21:12–17](../21/12.md))\n      * Jesus curses a fig tree ([21:18–22](../21/18.md))\n      * Jesus speaks with the chief priests and elders ([21:23–46](../21/23.md))\n        * Questions about authority ([21:23–27](../21/23.md))\n        * The parable of the two children ([21:28–32](../21/28.md))\n        * The parable of the vineyard ([21:33–41](../21/33.md))\n        * The stone that the builders rejected ([21:42–44](../21/42.md))\n        * The reaction of the chief priests and elders ([21:45–46](../21/45.md))\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [21:5](../21/05.md), [21:9](../21/09.md), and [21:42](../21/42.md), which are mostly quotes from the Old Testament.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### The donkey and the colt\n\nIn [21:1–4](../21/01.md), Jesus instructs two of his disciples to collect a donkey and a colt for him to use as he enters into Jerusalem. Matthew comments that Jesus did that in fulfillment of [Zechariah 9:9](../../zec/09/09.md), which indicates that a special king of Israel will ride on a donkey and on a colt, which is a poetic way of referring to a donkey that is a colt. In the story in Matthew, Matthew refers to both the donkey and the colt that the disciples collect, but he does not indicate which one Jesus actually rides. Make sure that it is clear that there are two animals that match the way that [Zechariah 9:9](../../zec/09/09.md) was written, but do not indicate which one Jesus rode on.\n\n### Hosanna\n\nThe word “Hosanna” is a Hebrew word spelled out how it sounds in Matthew’s language. The word means “save us, please.” By the time of Jesus, however, people would use the word to praise or honor God and others. Consider whether to spell the word out as it sounds or state its meaning. See the notes on [21:9](../21/09.md) and [21:15](../21/15.md) for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])\n\n### Disrupting activity in the temple area\n\nIn [21:12–13](../21/12.md), Jesus disrupts normal activity in the temple by driving out some people and by overturning the chairs and tables of others. Jesus performed this symbolic action to express a specific message. However, Christians debate exactly what the symbolic action means. Jesus could have been protesting against people who were buying and selling dishonestly. He could have been protesting against all buying and selling in the temple area. He could have been indicating that the temple would be destroyed. Your translation should state what Jesus did while allowing for all of these possible interpretations.\n\n### The baptism of John\n\nIn [21:25–27](../21/25.md), Jesus and the chief priests and elders discuss “the baptism of John.” Here they are referring to how John baptized people for repentance. Jesus asks them whether they think that John’s baptism came from heaven or from people, which means that he performed baptisms by God’s authority or by human authority. The chief priests and elders decide not to answer the question. See the notes on these verses for ways to refer to John’s baptism and to the authority behind it.\n\n### Renting out a vineyard\n\nIn [21:33–41](../21/33.md), Jesus tells a story about a man who built a vineyard and then rented it out to farmers. Jesus is referring to a common arrangement in which a wealthy person who owned property would have poorer people use that property for farming or tending grapes. These poorer people would do the work and then sell the produce, and they would give the person who owned the property a portion of what they made. If your readers would not be familiar with this kind of arrangement, make sure that your translation is clear about what is happening in the story.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### The parable of the two children\n\nIn [21:28–32](../21/28.md), Jesus tells and explains a story about a man and his two children. The man asks both children to work in his vineyard. The first child says that he will not but later works there anyway. The second child says that he will but later does not work there. Jesus and the chief priest and elders agree that it was the first child who actually did what the father wanted. Jesus then explains that he is illustrating how different groups of people reacted to John the Baptist’s ministry. People who sinned much but then repented when John preached are like the first child who actually did what the father wanted. The Jewish religious leaders who did not repent when John preached are like the second child who did not actually do what the father wanted. While you should not explain the meaning more than Jesus does, make sure that your translation fits with what Jesus is illustrating. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])\n\n### The parable of the vineyard\n\nIn [21:33–41](../21/33.md), Jesus tells a story about a man who planted a vineyard and rented it out to farmers. When the man sends servants to collect the rent, the farmers refuse and injure or kill the servants. When the man sends his own son, the farmers kill him as well. Jesus and the chief priests and elders agree that the man should destroy the farmers and rent the vineyard to other people. When he applies the parable in [21:42–44](../21/42.md), Jesus indicates that the Jewish religious leaders are like those farmers who will be destroyed. He also implies that the vineyard represents the people of Israel, the servants represent God’s messengers, the son represents Jesus himself, and the man who owned the vineyard represents God. While you should not explain the meaning more than Jesus does, make sure that your translation fits with what Jesus is illustrating. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])\n\n### The stone\n\nIn [21:42](../21/42.md), Jesus quotes from [Psalm 118:22–23](../../psa/118/022.md), which refers to a specific “stone.” In the Psalm, this stone most likely represents the king of Israel, or it perhaps represents the Israelite people in general. When Jesus refers to the stone in [21:42](../21/42.md) and [21:44](../21/44.md), he is implicitly identifying it with himself. Since the stone language comes from a quotation from the Psalms, you should preserve it in some form in your translation. Also, since Jesus does not explicitly claim to be the stone, you should keep that implicit in your translation. See the notes on these verses for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMany of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in speeches that Jesus gives to his disciples or to the Jewish leaders. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are plural. You should assume forms of “you” are plural unless a note specifies that the form is singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### The quote from Zechariah and Isaiah in [21:5](../21/05.md)\n\nIn [21:5](../21/05.md), Matthew quotes from someone whom he calls “the prophet” ([21:4](../21/04.md)). The last three lines of the quotation are from [Zechariah 9:9](../../zec/09/09.md). The first line sounds somewhat like the first line of [Zechariah 9:9](../../zec/09/09.md), but it matches the first line of [Isaiah 62:11](../../isa/62/11.md) exactly. Most likely, Matthew was thinking of both of these verses when he wrote down the quotation. If you must refer to the author of the quotation or book from which the quotation came, it is recommended that you refer to Zechariah, since most of the quotation is from that book. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations]])\n\n### Different versions of the parable of the two children\n\nThere are two primary versions of the parable of the two children in [21:28–31](../21/28.md):\n\n1. The first child says that he will not work in the vineyard but later does. Meanwhile, the second child says that he will work in the vineyard but does not. The chief priests and scribes say that the first child did what the father wanted.\n2. The first child says that he will work in the vineyard but does not. Meanwhile, the second child says that he will not work in the vineyard but later does. The chief priests and scribes say that the second child did what the father wanted.\n\nThe ULT and the UST are based on the first version listed above. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])\n\n## Textual Issues in This Chapter\n\nA few manuscripts do not include anything for [21:44](../21/44.md). Many early manuscripts do include the verse. While it it possible that people added this verse because similar words appear in the same place in [Luke 20:18](../../luk/20/18.md), it is more likely that this verse was accidentally omitted from a few manuscripts. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. Otherwise, since it is likely that [21:44](../21/44.md) does belong here, it is recommended that you follow the ULT by including the verse. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])

He speaks of people whom this person punishes as if the **stone** fell on them and crushed them. Jesus is applying this quotation to himself as the **stone**. However, if possible, preserve the metaphor in your translation, or, if necessary, you could express the idea in simile form. Alternate translation: [people who have rejected the person I have mentioned are like people who fall on a stone and are broken to pieces. When the person I have mentioned punishes people, it is like a stone falling on them and crushing them]
21:44	e7qc		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ὁ πεσὼν ἐπὶ τὸν λίθον τοῦτον, συνθλασθήσεται	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who would do the action, it is clear from the context that it would be the **stone**. Alternate translation: [this stone will break to pieces the one having fallen on it]
21:44	xisg		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸν λίθον τοῦτον	1	Here, **this stone** is the same stone as in [21:42](../21/42.md). You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [that stone] or [the stone that became the head of the corner]
21:44	xjw6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicitinfo	ἐφ’ ὃν & ἂν πέσῃ, λικμήσει αὐτόν	1	Jesus first introduces the person on whom the stone **falls** and then states what will happen to that person. If stating the topic and then referring back to it with the word **him** would be redundant in your language, you could express the idea in another way. Alternate translation: [it will crush whomever it falls on]
21:44	l37p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	αὐτόν	1	Although the term **him** is masculine, Jesus is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a phrase that makes this clear. Alternate translation: [that person]
21:45	gh8w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	λέγει	1	To call attention to a development in the story, Matthew uses the present tense in past narration. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: [he was speaking]

Alternate translation: [Now the crowds regarded him as a prophet, so they, seeking to arrest him, were afraid of those crowds]
21:46	ttbo		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐφοβήθησαν τοὺς ὄχλους	1	Matthew implies that the chief priests and Pharisees did not **seize** Jesus. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [they did not do so since they feared the crowds]
21:46	i35y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τοὺς ὄχλους	1	Matthew implies that the chief priests and the Pharisees **feared** what **the crowds** would do if they seized Jesus. They might have rioted or attacked them. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [what the crowd would do] or [that the crowd might riot]
22:intro	k5ze				0	# Matthew 22 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n9. Jesus ministers in Judea ([19:1–22:46](../19/01.md))\n      * The parable of the wedding feast ([22:1–14](../22/01.md))\n      * Jesus debates with the religious leaders ([22:15–46](../22/15.md))\n        * Jesus debates with the Pharisees and Herodians about taxes ([22:15–22](../22/15.md))\n        * Jesus debates with the Sadducees about the resurrection ([22:23–33](../22/23.md))\n        * Jesus debates with a lawyer about the greatest commandment ([22:34–40](../22/34.md))\n        * Jesus asks the religious leaders about the Christ ([22:41–46](../22/41.md))\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [22:44](../22/44.md), which is a quote from [Psalm 110:1](../../psa/110/001.md).\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### The poll tax\n\nThe word translated as “poll tax” refers to a specific amount of money that each adult person had to pay to the government. In Jesus’ time period, the Roman government required Jewish adults to pay a high tax. The Pharisees ask whether this tax that the Roman government required contradicted the law that God gave Moses. Make sure that your readers understand that the Pharisees are asking about a tax that the Roman government required each adult Jewish person to pay.\n\n### A man marrying his brother’s widow\n\nIn [22:23–33](../22/23.md), the Sadducees question Jesus in regard to a hypothetical situation in which a woman marries seven brothers in succession. This situation is based on a command in the Jewish law that can be found in [Deuteronomy 25:5–6](../../deu/25/05.md). The law requires a woman who is widowed without children to marry a brother of her late husband. The first child that they have together will be considered the child of the dead man. In this way, that man’s family line would continue. The Sadducees present an extreme application of this law, with seven brothers successively marrying the same woman and dying without having children. They use this example to try to make the idea of resurrection look strange or silly. Make sure that your readers understand the example that the Sadducees present.\n\n### The great commandment\n\nJewish teachers sometimes debated which specific commandment was the greatest or most important one. This was important because, if commandments seemed to contradict each other in a specific situation, the greater one would be the correct one to obey. When the lawyer asks Jesus about “the first and great commandment” in [22:36](../22/36.md), he wants Jesus to offer an opinion about this debate. Make sure that your readers understand that this is what the lawyer is asking about.\n\n### King David and the Christ\n\nIn [22:41–45](../22/41.md), Jesus asks the Pharisees about which important person the Christ is descended from. They give a commonly accepted answer: the Christ is King David’s descendant. Jesus then quotes from [Psalm 110:1](../../psa/110/001.md), in which King David, the author of the Psalm, calls God “Lord” but then also calls someone else, the Christ, “my Lord.” Since people in David’s culture called older and more important people “lord,” it does not make sense for David to call his own descendant “Lord.” When Jesus asks about this, he implies that the Christ is indeed King David’s descendant, but he is also more than that. Make sure that this the discussion about calling someone “Lord” is clear to your readers.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### The Parable of the Wedding Feast\n\nIn [22:1–14](../22/01.md), Jesus tells a story about a king whose son was getting married. He wanted to throw a feast, so he invited important people to come. However, they refused to come and even mistreated the king’s servants. In response, the king punished those people and instead invited many unimportant people whom his servants found. When the king went to visit these guests, he noticed that one of them was not wearing clothing appropriate for a wedding feast. He had him tied up and punished. He applies this parable by indicating that many people are “called” to be part of God’s kingdom but only a few of them are “chosen” to actually do so. In other words, just as the king invited many people to come to the feast, but only a few actually attended, so God invites many people to participate in his kingdom, but only a few actually do so. While you should not explain the meaning more than Jesus does, make sure that your translation fits with what Jesus is illustrating. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMany of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in speeches that Jesus gives to the Jewish leaders or in things that the king in the parable says to his servants. Because of this, many forms of “you” in this chapter are plural. You should assume forms of “you” are plural unless a note specifies that the form is singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### Paradox\n\nA paradox is a statement that describes two things that seemingly cannot both be true at the same time. To the Jews, ancestors were greater than their descendants. However, in one psalm David calls one of his descendants “Lord.” Jesus tells the Jewish leaders that this is a paradox, asking, “If David then calls the Christ ‘Lord,’ how is he David’s son?” ([22:45](../22/45.md)). He is trying to lead his hearers to the true understanding that the Christ will be divine, and that he himself is the Christ. So David is speaking to his son, that is, his descendant, as the Christ, and it is appropriate for him to address him as his “Lord.”

In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: [and people no longer dared from that day to question him]
22:46	a4yx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἀπ’ ἐκείνης τῆς ἡμέρας	1	The phrase **from that day** indicates that nobody questioned Jesus after he said what Matthew recorded in the previous verses. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable expression or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [starting right then] or [from that moment on]
23:intro	m99i				0	# Matthew 23 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n10. Jesus teaches about the final judgment and salvation ([23:1–25:46](../23/01.md))\n      * Jesus warns his disciples against acting like the Pharisees ([23:1–12](../23/01.md))\n      * Seven woes against the Pharisees and scribes ([23:13–36](../23/13.md))\n        * First woe: shutting the kingdom ([23:13](../23/13.md))\n        * Second woe: making proselytes ([23:15](../23/15.md))\n        * Third woe: rules about swearing ([23:16–22](../23/16.md))\n        * Fourth woe: tithing ([23:23–24](../23/23.md))\n        * Fifth woe: cleaning inside and outside ([23:25–26](../23/25.md))\n        * Sixth woe: whitewashed tombs ([23:27–28](../23/27.md))\n        * Seventh woe: killing the prophets ([23:29–36](../23/29.md))\n      * Lament over Jerusalem ([23:37–39](../23/37.md))\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Woe\n\nSeven times in this chapter, Jesus says “woe to you.” He is speaking to the scribes and Pharisees, and he is warning them that something bad will happen to them because of how they are acting. Consider how might express such a warning in your language. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/woe]])\n\n### Hypocrites\n\nSix times in this chapter, Jesus calls the scribes and Pharisees “hypocrites.” This word describes people who or claim one thing but actually do another. After calling them “hypocrites,” Jesus goes on to illustrate how they act in this way. Consider what you might call someone who says one thing but does another. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/hypocrite]])\n\n### Swearing by something\n\nIn Jesus’ culture, people would make a promise stronger by swearing by something. This means that they would call upon that thing to witness or guarantee what they promised. Jewish teachers and scholars debated which things most strongly guaranteed a promise. In [23:16–22](../23/16.md), Jesus gives his own teaching on this issue.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Being “blind”\n\nFive times in this chapter, Jesus calls scribes and Pharisees “blind.” He means that they fail to understand what is right and true. He does not mean that they are physically blind. Consider how you might express this idea in your language.\n\n### Cleaning cups and plates\n\nIn [23:25–26](../23/25.md), Jesus refers to cleaning the inside and outside of cups and plates. There are two primary ways to understand these verses. First, Jesus could be using cups and plates as a metaphor to speak about the scribes and Pharisees. In this case, he is saying that they should look righteous and also do what is righteous, just like cups and plates should be clean both on the outside and on the inside. Second, Jesus could be referring to literal cups and plates that the Pharisees use to eat food. In this case, he is saying that how they get the food that they eat from their cups and plates should be as “clean” (that is, righteously acquired) as the cups and plates are. The UST follows the first interpretation, and translation options for the second interpretation are in the notes.\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMost of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in speeches that Jesus gives to his disciples or to the Jewish leaders. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are plural. You should assume forms of “you” are plural unless a note specifies that the form is singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### Verse 14\n\nMost of the earliest manuscripts do not include anything for [23:14](../23/14.md). Some manuscripts include the following words: “But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you devour the houses of widows, also for a pretext praying at length. For this reason, you will receive greater judgment.” Since the earliest manuscripts do not include these words, the ULT and UST put these words in brackets. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to omit these words. If it would be helpful, you could put the words in brackets or in a footnote. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])

23:3	nrk0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	λέγουσιν & καὶ οὐ ποιοῦσιν	1	Jesus implies that the Pharisees and scribes **say** what to do, but they themselves **do not do** what they say that others should do. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [they say what to do, and they do not do what they say]
23:3	k870		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ	2	The word **and** introduces what the Pharisees and scribes actually **do** in contrast with what **they say**.

He means that they tell people many things to do, some of which are hard to do, but they do not do anything to help those people do the things that they require. If it would be helpful in your language, you could express the idea in simile form or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [And they tell people many things that they need to do, which are like loads, heavy and difficult to carry, that they have tied up and put on the shoulders of these people. However, they are not willing to help these people do what what they have told them to do, as if they were not willing to move those loads with their finger] or [And they tell people many things that they need to do, but they are not willing to help these people do what they have told them to do]
23:4	nexy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	βαρέα καὶ δυσβάστακτα	1	The terms **heavy** and **difficult to bear** mean similar things. Jesus is using the two terms together for emphasis.

23:4	rn0r		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	τῶν ἀνθρώπων	1	Although the term **men** is masculine, Jesus is using the word in a generic sense that includes both men and women.

23:31	l7rl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	υἱοί ἐστε τῶν φονευσάντων	1	The phrase **sons** means male descendants. It does not mean that the scribes and Pharisees are the direct sons of the people who killed the prophets.

23:32	vhes		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony	πληρώσατε τὸ μέτρον τῶν πατέρων ὑμῶν	1	Jesus commands the opposite of what he wants in order to make a point. He means that they should carefully consider the consequences if they do **fill up the measure** of their **fathers**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly.

23:35	e1gw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	ὅπως	1	The phrase **so that** could introduce: (1) a result from what the scribes and Pharisees will do.

In this way, Jesus indicates that he is speaking about all the stories about the murders of righteous people. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [from the blood of Abel the righteous, the first victim, and including the blood of every victim after that up to the last, the blood of Zechariah]
23:35	espy		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	Ζαχαρίου & Βαραχίου	1	The words **Zechariah** and **Barachiah** are the names of men. The man named **Zechariah** is most likely the one whose murder is described in [2 Chronicles 24:20–22](../../2ch/24/20.md).

23:37	cjr2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	ἡ ἀποκτείνουσα τοὺς προφήτας καὶ λιθοβολοῦσα, τοὺς ἀπεσταλμένους πρὸς αὐτήν	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternatively, you could combine the two phrases. Alternate translation: [the one killing the prophets, indeed, stoning the ones having been sent to her] or [the one killing the prophets having been sent to her by stoning them]

23:37	zi3g		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	αὐτήν	1	Although Jesus is speaking to **Jerusalem**, he uses the third person here. If this would not be natural in your language, you could use the second person form. Alternate translation: [you]
23:37	d9ho		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclamations	ποσάκις	1	The phrase **How often** introduces an exclamation, not a question. Jesus uses the exclamation to show how strongly he feels about **Jerusalem**. Use a form that communicates strong emotion in your language. Alternate translation: [Very strongly]
23:37	qsf0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	σου	1	Since Jesus is speaking to **Jerusalem**, the word **your** here is singular.
23:37	xv4t		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	ὃν τρόπον ὄρνις ἐπισυνάγει τὰ νοσσία αὐτῆς ὑπὸ τὰς πτέρυγας	1	Jesus is saying that he wants to act like **a hen** that **gathers her chicks** because he wants to comfort and protect the people of Jerusalem, just as **a hen** does that for **her chicks**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state that explicitly. Alternate translation: [the way a hen gathers her chicks under her wings to comfort and protect them]
23:37	as8p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ὄρνις & τὰ νοσσία αὐτῆς	1	A **hen** is a female chicken, and **chicks** are the young chickens she is raising. If your readers would not be familiar with this type of animal, you could use the name of something similar in your area or you could use a more general term. Alternate translation: [a bird … her young]
23:37	en1i		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	καὶ	2	The word **and** introduces what the people of Jerusalem actually did in contrast with what Jesus wanted them to do.

23:38	gbpd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἰδοὺ	1	The word **Behold** draws the attention of the audience and asks them to listen carefully.

Alternate translation: [Listen] or [Be aware]
23:38	ck2z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	ἀφίεται ὑμῖν ὁ οἶκος ὑμῶν ἔρημος	1	Jesus could speaking: (1) of the city of Jerusalem as if it were a **house** that will be **left** to its people **desolate**. In this case, he means that the city will be destroyed so much that people will no longer live there. Alternate translation: [your city will be left to you like a desolate house] or [your city will be destroyed]; (2) of the temple as if it were a **house** that will be **left** to its people **desolate**. In this case, he means that God will no longer be present in the temple. Alternate translation: [your temple will be left to you like a desolate house] or [God will abandon your temple]
23:38	jl65		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἀφίεται & ὁ οἶκος ὑμῶν	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. If you need to say who does the action, it is clear from the context that it is God. Alternate translation: [God will leave your house]
23:38	e5sh		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	ἀφίεται	1	Jesus is using the present tense in order to refer to something that will happen in the future. He is doing this to show that the event will certainly happen. Alternate translation: [will be left]
23:39	wc86		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	γὰρ	1	The word **For** introduces support for the claim that Jesus made in the previous verse.

Alternate translation: [That is because, as]
23:39	r74f		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐ μή	1	The words translated as **certainly not** are two negative words in the original language. In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: [by no means]
23:39	r6o6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἀπ’ ἄρτι	1	Jesus uses the word **now** to refer to the time of his current visit to Jerusalem. He is not referring to just the current moment. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [the time of my current visit with you]
23:39	eqnl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἕως ἂν εἴπητε	1	Jesus could be indicating that they will **certainly not see** him: (1) until the time when they **say** the following words. Alternate translation: [until the time when you say]; (2) unless they **say** the following words. Alternate translation: [unless you say]
23:39	soho		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εὐλογημένος ὁ ἐρχόμενος ἐν ὀνόματι Κυρίου	1	Jesus is quoting from [Psalm 118:26](../../psa/118/026.md). Since he does not introduce the words as a quotation from an important text, you also should not introduce them as anything more than what he said. However, if it would be helpful for your readers, you could include this information in a footnote.
23:39	luw3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	εὐλογημένος ὁ ἐρχόμενος ἐν ὀνόματι Κυρίου	1	The exact same sentence appears in [21:9](../21/09.md). Translate it as you did there.
24:intro	h2a2				0	# Matthew 24 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n10. Jesus teaches about the final judgment and salvation ([23:1–25:46](../23/01.md))\n      * The disciples ask Jesus about the destruction of the temple and the end of the age ([24:1–3](../24/01.md))\n      * Jesus teaches about the destruction of the temple ([24:4–35](../24/04.md))\n        * Things that will happen in the time before the destruction of the temple ([24:4–14](../24/04.md))\n        * Things that will happen immediately before the destruction of the temple ([24:15–28](../24/15.md))\n        * The coming of the Son of Man ([24:29–31](../24/29.md))\n        * When these things will happen ([24:32–35](../24/32.md))\n      * Jesus teaches about the end of the age ([24:36–51](../24/36.md))\n        * No one knows when this will happen ([24:36–41](../24/36.md))\n        * The need to be alert ([24:42–44](../24/42.md))\n        * The parable of the faithful slave and the evil slave ([24:45–51](../24/45.md))\n\n### When Jesus speaks about which topics\n\nWhen the disciples speak to Jesus in [24:3](../24/03.md), they ask about two things: first, they want to know when the temple will be destroyed, and second, they want to know about the sign of Jesus’ coming and of the end of the age. Christians disagree about when Jesus is speaking about which topic. He could:\n1. finish speaking about the destruction of the temple in [24:35](../24/35.md) and then go on to speak about his second coming (the outline above follows this view)\n2. finish speaking about the destruction of the temple in [24:28](../24/28.md) and then go on to speak about his second coming\n3. speak about the destruction of the temple as a foreshadowing of the final tribulation in [24:4–28](../24/04.md) and [24:32–35](../24/32.md) and speak about his second coming in [24:29–31](../24/29.md)\n\nSince Christians disagree over when Jesus is speaking about which topic, if possible format your translation so that several interpretations are possible.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### The destruction of the temple\n\nThe temple in Jerusalem was a very impressive, large building. Despite that, Jesus predicted that it would be destroyed within the lifetime of those who heard him. In fact, about 40 years later, a Roman army conquered Jerusalem and destroyed the temple.\n\n### The end of the age\n\nThe disciples ask Jesus about “the end of the age,” which both they and Jesus imply is also the time of Jesus’ second coming. The end of the age is the moment when God changes how things are in the present time to how they will be forever after Jesus’ second coming. Consider how you might naturally refer to this time in your translation.\n\n### The Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven\n\nIn [24:30](../24/30.md), Jesus indicates that he, the Son of Man, will “come” on the clouds of heaven. However, he does not indicate the location to which he will “come.” Christians debate whether Jesus is describing his return to earth or his enthronement in heaven. If possible, your translation should allow for both possibilities. See the notes on this verse for translation options.\n\n### “This generation” in [24:34](../24/34.md)\n\nIn [24:34](../24/34.md), Jesus says that what he has described will happen before “this generation” passes away. Many interpretations have been proposed for the group of people to which “this generation” refers:\n1. The people who were alive while Jesus was speaking these words\n2. The people who would be alive when the signs of the end began\n3. People who are like those who did not believe while Jesus was on earth\n4. Jewish people in general throughout history\n5. Humans in general\n\nSince the word that Jesus uses primarily refers to people who are alive at the same time, if possible use a word or phrase that refers to such a group of people. If it would be helpful for your readers, you could include some interpretations of the word in a footnote.\n\n### The days of Noah\n\nIn [24:37–39](../24/37.md), Jesus compares the coming of the Son of Man with the time period of Noah. When Noah was alive, God told him to warn people that an enormous flood was coming. Noah built a large boat named an ark so that he, his family, and many animals could float on the water and survive the flood. However, people did not listen to Noah, and when the flood finally happened, everyone else died. Jesus says that the coming of the Son of Man will similarly surprise people who have not listened to his warnings. Just as the flood began suddenly, so the coming of the Son of Man will begin suddenly. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could include information about Noah in a footnote.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### The proverb about the corpse and the vultures\n\nIn [24:28](../24/28.md), Jesus uses or invents a proverb that states that wherever a corpse is, there vultures will gather. He could be using this proverb to indicate that:\n1. the coming of the Son of Man will be very obvious, just as a corpse is obvious because of the vultures that gather near it\n2. people and groups of people that are spiritually dead will certainly be judged and punished, just as a corpse is devoured by vultures\n3. believers who have died (the corpse) will come back to life with the aid of angels (the vultures)\n\nSince Christians debate how Jesus wishes to apply this proverb, it is best to preserve the proverb without explaining its meaning. See the notes on this verse for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs]])\n\n### The parable of the faithful slave and the evil slave\n\nIn [24:45–51](../24/45.md), Jesus tells a story about how a slave might react to being put in charge of the rest of the household when the master goes on a journey. If the slave is wise and faithful, he will do what his master asked him to do. Then, when the master returns, the slave will be rewarded. On the other hand, if the slave is evil, he will abuse the other slaves and feast with drunk people. Jesus tells this story to make his disciples think about how they should behave during the time before his second coming. They should be like the wise and faithful slave, not the evil slave. Your translation should not directly explain the meaning of this parable more than Jesus does, but be sure that your readers understand how to apply the story. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMost of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in teaching that Jesus gives to his disciples. Because of this, most forms of “you” in this chapter are plural. You should assume forms of “you” are plural unless a note specifies that the form is singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])

Use a natural method in your language for introducing an imaginary situation.

24:50	ss9h		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐν ἡμέρᾳ & ἐν ὥρᾳ	1	Jesus is using the terms **day** and **hour** to refer to a specific moment in time.

24:51	pv2d		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	τὸ μέρος αὐτοῦ μετὰ τῶν ὑποκριτῶν θήσει	1	The phrase **appoint his place with the hypocrites** indicates that the slave will be treated as **the hypocrites** are. More specifically, if the phrase **cut him in two** refers to: (1) a severe punishment, then Jesus indicates that the slave is punished in the same place where **the hypocrites** are punished. Alternate translation: [cause him to be punished where the hypocrites are punished]; (2) literally killing the servant, then Jesus indicates that the slave ends up after his death where **the hypocrites** end up: in hell. Alternate translation: [send him to hell with the hypocrites]
24:51	rwd5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	ἐκεῖ ἔσται ὁ κλαυθμὸς καὶ ὁ βρυγμὸς τῶν ὀδόντων	1	This clause is identical to the last clause in [8:12](../08/12.md). Translate it as you did there.
25:intro	qe8a				0	# Matthew 25 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n10. Jesus teaches about the final judgment and salvation ([23:1–25:46](../23/01.md))\n      * The parable of the ten virgins ([25:1–13](../25/01.md))\n      * The parable of the talents ([25:14–30](../25/14.md))\n      * Teaching about the final judgment ([25:31–46](../25/31.md))\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### The “lamps”\n\nThe word translated as “lamps” throughout [25:1–13](../25/01.md) primarily refers to something that burns and gives light. Most likely, Jesus is either referring to oil lamps, which burn oil using a wick to create a relatively small amount of light, or to torches, which are soaked in oil and lit to create a relatively large amount of light. Since most translations express the idea with a word like “lamp,” the ULT and the UST translate the word as “lamp” and “oil lamp.” Consider whether “lamp” or “torch” better fits what the story narrates and then use the term that is more natural. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/lamp]])\n\n### Escorting the bridegroom\n\nIn [25:1–13](../25/01.md), Jesus uses wedding customs to illustrate how to wait for his second coming. Unfortunately, we know very little about Jewish wedding customs during this time period. The story that Jesus tells implies that young women would escort the bridegroom to where the wedding celebration would be held. These young women may have been friends of the bride. It is unclear whether this is the first event in the wedding celebration, and it is also unclear exactly where the young women escort the bridegroom. It could be the bride’s parents’ house, a wedding hall, or some other location. Since Jesus does not include any further explanation, and since we do not know much about weddings in this time period, you should avoid giving explanatory information except for clarifying that the young women escort the bridegroom to wherever the wedding event was going to happen.\n\n### Talents\n\nA talent was a unit of weight that, when used for precious metals, was also a unit of money. One talent weighed about 30 kilograms or about 65 pounds. The talent referred to in this chapter was probably worth about 6,000 denarii, that is, about 6,000 days’ wages for a hired worker. The exact amount of money is not important, so you could use a general term in your culture for that amount of money, or you could indicate about how many days’ wages it would be worth. Alternatively, you could spell “talent” how it sounds in your language and then provide a footnote that indicates about how much money this is. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-bmoney]])\n\n### The final judgment\n\nIn [25:31–46](../25/31.md), Jesus describes some of what will happen at the final judgment when he, the Son of Man and the king, judges everyone. He divides people into two groups, and then he explains that this is based on how they have treated the least important believers. Then, he sends the ones who did not do what was right to eternal punishment, and he takes the ones who did what was right to experience eternal life with him. Jesus describes this scene to explain what the final judgment will be like, not to narrate everything about the final judgment exactly as it will happen, so be sure not to include anything beyond what he describes.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### The parable of the ten virgins\n\nIn [25:1–13](../25/01.md), Jesus tells a story about ten young women who are supposed to escort a bridegroom to his wedding celebration. Five of them brought extra oil for their lamps, and five did not. When the bridegroom was late, the five young women who did not have extra oil had to go and buy some more, and they missed the bridegroom and the wedding celebration. Jesus uses this story to illustrate how his followers need to be prepared at all times for when he returns, since they do not know when that will be, just as the young women did not know when the bridegroom was going to arrive. Your translation should not directly explain the meaning of this parable more than Jesus does, but be sure that your readers understand how to apply the story. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])\n\n### The parable of the talents\n\nIn [25:14–30](../25/14.md), Jesus tells a story about a rich man who went on a journey. Before he left, he entrusted three of his servants with large sums of money. The first and second servant used the large sums of money to make even more money. The third servant, however, buried the money in the ground to keep it safe and did not make any more money. When the rich man returned, he rewarded the first two servants but punished the third servant. Jesus uses this story to illustrate how his followers should behave during the time before his second coming. They should be like the first two servants, who used what they were given to do useful things. They should not be like the third servant, who did not use what he was given to do anything. Your translation should not directly explain the meaning of this parable more than Jesus does, but be sure that your readers understand how to apply the story. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parables]])\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMost of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in dialogues in the stories that Jesus tells. Because of this, there are many of both singular and plural forms of “you.” However, there are slightly more plural forms of “you” in this chapter, so you should assume forms of “you” are plural unless a note specifies that the form is singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])

25:1	uhj1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	λαμπάδας	1	The **lamps** throughout this story could be: (1) small clay containers for oil, which was burned using a wick.

26:intro	mtq8				0	# Matthew 26 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n11. The crucifixion of Jesus, his death, and his resurrection ([26:1–28:19](../26/01.md))\n      * The chief priests and elders plan to kill Jesus ([26:1–5](../26/01.md))\n      * A woman anoints Jesus ([26:6–13](../26/06.md))\n      * Judas agrees to hand Jesus over ([26:14–16](../26/14.md))\n      * Jesus’ last meal with his disciples ([26:17–29](../26/17.md))\n      * Jesus predicts that his disciples will deny him ([26:30–35](../26/30.md))\n      * Jesus prays in Gethsemane ([26:36–46](../26/36.md))\n      * Judas hands Jesus over ([26:47–56](../26/47.md))\n      * Jesus’ trial before the Jewish council ([26:57–68](../26/57.md))\n      * Peter denies Jesus three times ([26:69–75](../26/69.md))\n\nSome translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in [26:31](../26/31.md), which is a quote from [Zechariah 13:7](../../zec/13/07.md).\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Perfumed oil\n\nIn [26:6–13](../26/06.md), a woman anoints Jesus with perfumed oil. The kind that the woman uses was very expensive. People would use these oils to make themselves look and smell good. Also, they used oils to anoint corpses before they buried them, possibly to keep them from smelling. In this story, the woman uses the oil to honor Jesus, and Jesus also interprets it as a preparation for his burial. Make sure that your readers understand what anointing with this kind of oil means. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/oil]])\n\n### Denying Jesus\n\nThroughout this chapter, Jesus and his disciples speak about “denying” Jesus. If a disciple denies Jesus, the disciple claims to have no connection with Jesus, neither knowing nor following him. Consider how you might naturally express this idea in your language.\n\n### Jesus’ trial before the Jewish council\n\nIn [26:57–68](../26/57.md), Matthew narrates Jesus’ trial before the Jewish council. Since Jerusalem was governed by the Roman empire, the Roman governor, Pilate, was the only one who could actually have someone executed. So, the Jewish council needed to find evidence against Jesus that proved that he did something for which the Roman governor would execute him. This trial, then, was a preliminary step. They first needed to find good evidence to condemn Jesus, and then they needed to present evidence to the Roman governor that would lead to him executing Jesus. While you should not explain all these details in your translation, make sure that your translation does fit with this general idea.\n\n### The Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven\n\nIn [26:64](../26/64.md), Jesus indicates that he, the Son of Man, will “come” on the clouds of heaven. However, he does not indicate the location to which he will “come.” Christians debate whether Jesus is describing his return to earth or his enthronement in heaven. If possible, your translation should allow for both possibilities. See the notes on this verse for translation options.\n\n### Peter’s accent\n\nIn [26:73](../26/73.md), people who are standing near Peter tell him that they think he was one of Jesus’ disciples. They back up this claim by referring to his “speech,” by which they mean his accent and choice of words. In other words, Peter’s accent and word choice make it clear that he is from Galilee, where Jesus was from. So, they infer that Peter came to Jerusalem from Galilee with Jesus. Make sure that it is clear in your translation that the people standing near Peter are speaking about his accent and word choice that prove that he is from a specific region.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Metaphor with bread and cup\n\nIn [26:26–28](../26/26.md), Jesus identifies bread as “my body” and wine in a cup as “my blood of the covenant.” These metaphors can be understood in at least three primary ways: (1) the bread and wine somehow become Jesus’ body and blood; (2) Jesus’ body and blood are present, physically or spiritually, in the bread and wine; or (3) the bread and wine memorialize or symbolize Jesus’ body and blood. Christians are divided on this question, and metaphors that link body and blood to bread and wine are very significant in the Bible and in Christian teaching. For these reasons, it is best to preserve these metaphors without expressing them as similes or in another nonfigurative way. If you must express them in another way, see the notes on [26:26–28](../26/26.md) for translation possibilities. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMost of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in dialogue, which can include both individuals and groups. Because of this, there are many of both singular and plural forms of “you.” However, there are slightly more plural forms of “you” in this chapter, so you should assume forms of “you” are plural unless a note specifies that the form is singular. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### The answer “You said it”\n\nIn [26:25](../26/25.md) and [26:64](../26/64.md), Jesus answers questions with the clause “You said it.” He uses this answer because he does not want to directly say “yes,” but he wants to imply that what the person asked is true in some way. In other words, Jesus’ answer indirectly provides a positive answer to the question. If possible, you should use a comparable phrase that gives an indirect positive answer to a question. If necessary, you could use a more direct answer, as modeled by the UST. See the notes on these verses for translation options that are more indirect.\n\n### Judas’ kiss for Jesus\n\nIn [26:49](../26/49.md), Matthew describes how Judas kissed Jesus so the soldiers would know whom to arrest. In this culture, when men greeted other men who were family or friends, they would **kiss** them, probably on one cheek or on both cheeks. If men would not greet each other with a kiss in your culture, you could explain the purpose of the kiss, or you could translate the expression in a more general way. See the notes on this verse for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/kiss]])

26:22	s5gb		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	λυπούμενοι σφόδρα	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

26:24	riwt		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	ὑπάγει	1	Jesus uses the present tense to describe a future event. He does this to emphasize that the future event is sure to happen.

26:24	x2n9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-euphemism	ὑπάγει	1	Here, **departs** is a polite way to refer to dying. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable polite way to refer to dying, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [passes away] or [dies]

26:25	y9lk		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	σὺ εἶπας	1	The phrase **You said {it}** indicates that the speaker acknowledges the truth of what the other person said. Jesus uses this phrase to indirectly indicate that Judas is the one who will hand him over. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a different word or phrase that gives an indirect positive response to a question. If necessary, you could express the idea more directly, as the UST does. Alternate translation: [That is what you say] or [Your words show what is true]
26:25	ftbx		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	σὺ	1	Since Jesus is talking to Judas, the word **You** here is singular.

26:26	tkiu		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τοῦτό ἐστιν τὸ σῶμά μου	1	Jesus identifies the bread as his **body**. This figure of speech has been interpreted in a number of ways. The bread could somehow become Jesus’ **body**, or Jesus’ **body** could be present in some way when people eat the bread, or the bread could represent or memorialize Jesus’ **body**. Because of the variety of interpretations and the significance of this metaphor, you should preserve the metaphor if there is any way to do so. If you must express the metaphor in a different way, use a form that could fit with as many of the listed interpretations as possible. Alternate translation: [This functions as my body]
26:27	tn39		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	ποτήριον	1	Matthew uses the word **cup** to refer both the container and to the drink inside the container, a cup.

26:28	o1zn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	τοῦτο & ἐστιν τὸ αἷμά μου τῆς διαθήκης	1	Jesus identifies the cup of wine as his **blood** of **the covenant**. This figure of speech has been interpreted in a number of ways. The wine could somehow become Jesus’ **blood**, or Jesus’ **blood** could be present in some way when people drink the wine, or the wine could represent or memorialize Jesus’ **blood**. Because of the variety of interpretations and the significance of this metaphor, you should preserve the metaphor if there is any way to do so. If you must express the metaphor in a different way, use a form that could fit with as many of the listed interpretations as possible. Alternate translation: [this functions as my blood of the covenant]
26:28	ct81		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	τὸ αἷμά μου τῆς διαθήκης	1	Jesus is using the possessive form to describe how his **blood** inaugurates or initiates **the covenant**.

If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
26:28	glj9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	τὸ περὶ πολλῶν ἐκχυννόμενον	1	Jesus means that he will die and his **blood** will be **poured out** of his body. He is using words that people would use to describe how animals would be offered to God: these animals would be killed and then their blood would be **poured out** on or near the altar. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [that, when I die, is being poured out for many] or [that is being shed for many]
26:28	bms3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	ἐκχυννόμενον	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language.

26:28	vofa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-nominaladj	πολλῶν	1	Jesus is using the adjective **many** as a noun to mean many people. Your language may use adjectives in the same way. If not, you could translate this word with an equivalent phrase. Alternate translation: [many men and women]

26:29	hl24		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	λέγω & ὑμῖν, οὐ μὴ πίω	1	Jesus uses the clause **I say to you** to emphasize what he is about to tell the disciples. Use a natural form in your language for emphasizing the truth and importance of a statement. Alternate translation: [I want you to know that I will certainly not drink]
26:29	l556		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	οὐ μὴ	1	The words translated as **certainly not** are two negative words. In this construction, the second negative does not cancel the first to create a positive meaning. Instead, it gives greater emphasis to the negative. If your language can use two negatives that do not cancel one another to create a positive meaning, you could use a double negative here. If your language does not use two negatives in that way, you could translate with one strong negative, as the ULT does. Alternate translation: [by no means]
26:29	h85b		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	ἐκ τούτου τοῦ γενήματος τῆς ἀμπέλου	1	The phrase **fruit of the vine** refers to wine. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a comparable phrase or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [alcohol made from grapes] or [wine]

26:29	m9vq		rc://*/ta/man/translate/guidelines-sonofgodprinciples	τοῦ Πατρός μου	1	**Father** is an important title that describes the relationship between God the Father and Jesus the Son.
26:30	ed5k		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	ὑμνήσαντες	1	A **hymn** is a song or poem that is sung to praise God. The Jews would traditionally sing a psalm from [Psalms 113](../../psa/113/001.md)–118 at the end of the Passover meal, so the **hymn** that Jesus and his disciples sang was likely one of these psalms. If your readers would not be familiar with a **hymn**, you could use the name for religious songs in your culture, if you have them, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: [having sung a psalm] or [having sung a song of praise to God]
26:31	j2o2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-tense	λέγει	1	To call attention to a development in the story, Matthew uses the present tense in past narration. If it would not be natural to do that in your language, you could use the past tense in your translation. Alternate translation: [said]

Alternate translation: [It is written, ‘I will strike the shepherd and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.’ Therefore, you all will be caused to stumble on me in this night]
26:31	v8yl		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	σκανδαλισθήσεσθε ἐν ἐμοὶ	1	Jesus speaks as if he were a lump or rock that his disciples could **stumble on**.

26:31	svl0		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	σκανδαλισθήσεσθε	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [will stumble]

Alternate translation: [it is written that God will strike the shepherd and the sheep of the flock will be scattered]
26:31	mc1e		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	πατάξω τὸν ποιμένα, καὶ διασκορπισθήσονται τὰ πρόβατα τῆς ποίμνης	1	The author of the quotation speaks as if the Messiah were a **shepherd** and as if his people were **sheep of the flock**. He means that the Messiah is the leader, and his people are like helpless sheep without him. Since Jesus is quoting these words from the Old Testament, if possible preserve the metaphor or express the idea in simile form. Alternate translation: [I will strike the person who is like a shepherd, and those who are like sheep of the flock will be scattered]

27:intro	deu4				0	# Matthew 27 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n11. The crucifixion of Jesus, his death, and his resurrection ([26:1–28:19](../26/01.md))\n      * The Jewish council sends Jesus to Pilate, the governor ([27:1–2](../27/01.md))\n      * Judas repents and kills himself ([27:3–10](../27/03.md))\n      * Jesus’ trial before Pilate, the governor ([27:11–26](../27/11.md))\n      * Jesus is crucified ([27:27–56](../27/27.md))\n        * The soldiers mock Jesus ([27:27–31](../27/27.md))\n        * Jesus is crucified, and people mock him ([27:32–44](../27/32.md))\n        * Jesus dies ([27:45–56](../27/45.md))\n      * Joseph of Arimathea buries Jesus’ body ([27:57–61](../27/57.md))\n      * The chief priests and Pharisees secure Jesus’ tomb ([27:62–66](../27/62.md))\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### The prophecy about the 30 pieces of silver and the field of the potter\n\nIn [27:3–8](../27/03.md), Matthew tells the story of how Judas returned the 30 pieces of silver that the Jewish leaders had paid him to hand Jesus over. The leaders used that money to buy “the field of the potter” as a burial ground for foreigners. Then, in [27:9–10](../27/09.md), Matthew indicates that these events “fulfilled” what the prophet Jeremiah spoke. Then, Matthew summarizes or paraphrases [Zechariah 11:12–13](../../zec/11/12.md), [Jeremiah 19:1–13](../../jer/19/01.md), and [Jeremiah 32:6–9](../../jer/32/06.md). These passages speak about a potter, 30 pieces of silver, or someone buying a field. Since Matthew indicates that he is referring to what Jeremiah said, you too should indicate that these words come from Jeremiah. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use a form that indicates that Matthew is summarizing or paraphrasing from another text.\n\n### The drinks that people offered to Jesus\n\nIn [27:34](../27/34.md), the soldiers offer Jesus “wine mixed with gall.” In [27:48](../27/48.md), someone offers Jesus “vinegar.” In both cases, scholars debate whether people offered these drinks to help Jesus by easing the pain or quenching his thirst or whether they offered these drinks to torment Jesus by giving him a bad-tasting drink. Since it is not obvious what the purpose of the drinks was, if possible express the idea in such a way that your readers could draw either conclusion. If it would be helpful for your readers, you could include some extra information in a footnote. See the notes on these verses for translation options.\n\n### Calling Elijah\n\nIn [27:46](../27/46.md), Jesus calls out “Eli, Eli,” which is how Jesus said “My God, my God” in his language. Some of the people standing there misheard him and thought that he was calling out to “Elijah,” a prophet with a name that sounds like “Eli.” There is a story about this Elijah in [2 Kings 2:11–12](../../2ki/02/11.md), where God takes him into heaven. So, some people believed that Elijah did not die and would someday return. The people who thought Jesus was calling to Elijah thought that he was asking Elijah to return and rescue him. If your readers would not understand why the people standing near Jesus speak about Elijah, you could include some extra information in your translation or include this information in a footnote. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/names/elijah]])\n\n### The curtain of the temple tearing from top to bottom\n\nThe “curtain” to which Matthew refers in [27:51](../27/51.md) could be either the curtain that separated the Most Holy Place from the rest of the temple, or it could be the curtain that separated the Holy Place from the rest of the temple area. Matthew indicates that this curtain tore from the top to the bottom, which means that a person did not do it. Christians debate what the tearing of this curtain might have symbolized. There are at least three major options:\n\n1. The tearing of the curtain could indicate that access to God is now available to everyone.\n2. The tearing of the curtain could indicate that God is going to destroy the temple.\n3. The tearing of the curtain could indicate that God is about to do something powerful.\n\nSince Matthew does not explain what the tearing of the curtain means, you should not explain it in your translation. However, if it would be helpful for your readers, you could include what it might mean in a footnote.\n\n### The tomb of Joseph of Arimathea\n\nThe tomb in which Jesus was buried ([27:60](../27/60.md)) was the kind of tomb in which wealthy Jewish families buried their dead. It was an large hole or room cut into a rock. It had a flat place on one side where they could place the body after they had put oil and spices on it and wrapped it in cloth. Then they would roll a large rock in front of the tomb so no one could see inside or enter.\n\n### Sealing the tomb\n\nIn [27:66](../27/66.md), Matthew indicates that the chief priests and Pharisees “sealed” Jesus tomb. This means that they used something, probably wax on which they put a special symbol, to mark the stone that closed the tomb. It is not clear exactly where they put the “seal.” They might have attached it to the edge of the stone. They might have tied a rope around the stone and put the “seal” there. However, it was done, anyone who wanted to open the tomb would have to damage the “seal,” and the chief priests and Pharisees would know that someone had broken in. If your readers would not understand what the chief priests and Pharisees did, you could use a descriptive phrase or include some of this information in a footnote. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/other/seal]])\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Sarcasm\n\nIn this chapter, people mock Jesus several times. First, in [27:28–29](../27/28.md), the soldiers pretend like Jesus is a king. They give him a scarlet robe, a crown of thorns, and a reed, and they pretend to greet him as a king. They do not actually believe that Jesus is a king, so they are doing these things sarcastically to make fun of Jesus. Second, in [27:40–43](../27/40.md), people walking by and the Jewish leaders tell Jesus to save himself, to come down from the cross, and to wait for God to rescue him. They do not actually believe that he can do these things, so they are speaking sarcastically to make fun of Jesus. Make sure that it is clear in your translation that these are sarcastic actions done to make fun of Jesus. See the notes on these verses for translation options. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-irony]])\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nMost of the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in conversations, and many of the conversations are with one person. Because of this, the majority of the forms of “you” in this chapter are singular. So, you should assume forms of “you” are singular unless a note specifies that the form is plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani?\n\nIn [27:46](../27/46.md), Matthew spells out the sounds of the words that Jesus spoke in his own language. The words “lama sabachthani” are Aramaic, but it is unclear whether the words “Eli, Eli” are Aramaic or Hebrew. Either way, Matthew translates the words later on in the verse as “My God, my God, why did you forsake me?” You can express the idea as Matthew did by spelling out how the words sound and then translating their meaning in your language. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-transliterate]])

28:intro	psw9				0	# Matthew 28 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n11. The crucifixion of Jesus, his death, and his resurrection ([26:1–28:19](../26/01.md))\n      * Mary Magdalene and the other Mary learn that Jesus has resurrected ([28:1–10](../28/01.md))\n      * The chief priests and elders spread a false story ([28:11–15](../28/11.md))\n      * Jesus meets and commissions the 11 disciples ([28:16–20](../28/16.md))\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### The resurrection\n\nMatthew does not narrate the resurrection, but he does narrate how an angel opens the tomb so that people can tell that Jesus has risen from the dead. It is not clear exactly when Jesus actually rose from the dead, although it is clear that this happened before the angel opened the tomb. When Jesus rose from the dead, he was a living human being again, and he could never die again. Make sure that it is clear that Jesus came back to life as a living human being.\n\n### The false story about Jesus’ resurrection\n\nIn [28:11–15](../28/11.md), Matthew describes how the chief priests and the elders have the soldiers who were guarding the tomb spread a false story about what happened. The soldiers tell people that they fell asleep, and that Jesus’ disciples stole his body while they were asleep. In [28:15](../28/15.md), Matthew explains that he is telling this because the story was still circulating among Jewish people when he was writing this book. Make sure that it is clear to your readers that the chief priests and elders bribe the soldiers to spread this false story.\n\n### Discipling all the nations\n\nThe last two verses ([28:19–20](../28/19.md)) are commonly known as “The Great Commission” because they contain a very important command given to all Christians. Christians are to “disciple” all the nations, which includes telling them the gospel, baptizing them, and teaching them to obey what Jesus commanded. Make sure that this command is as general as possible, including all Christians all “nations.”\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### Singular and plural forms of “you”\n\nAll the forms of “you” in this chapter appear in instructions given to groups of people. Because of this, all the forms of “you” in this chapter are plural. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular]])\n\n### The timing of the women’s visit to the tomb\n\nIn [28:1](../28/01.md), Matthew indicates that the women went to Jesus’ tomb “after the Sabbath, at the dawning on the first of the week.” The words translated in this way can be understood in several ways:\n\n1. They could refer to the early morning (the “dawn”) on the day after the Sabbath. This would be the first day of the week, Sunday. Further, the parallel stories in [Mark 16:2](../../mrk/16/02.md) and [Luke 24:1](../../luk/24/01.md) similarly take place at dawn on Sunday. So, the ULT and UST follow this interpretation.\n\n2. They could refer to a time late in the day on the Sabbath. In this case, the word “dawning” would refer to the beginning of a day, not to the sun coming up. Since people in Jesus’ culture considered sunset to be the start of a new day, Matthew would be referring to evening on the Sabbath, right around the time when the next day, Sunday, would begin at sunset.\n\nIt is recommended that you follow the first interpretation unless there is a good reason to follow the second interpretation.
