There are six main parts to this structure. The chiasm pattern is ABCCBA. In terms of theme, the first and sixth parts are found in ([1:2–5](../01/02.md) and [3:13–15](../03/13.md)), the second and fifth parts match ([1:6–14](../01/06.md) and [3:6–12](../03/06.md)), and the third and fourth parts match ([2:10–16](../02/10.md) and [2:17–3:5](../02/01.md)). There is also an excursus, a special message to the priests ([2:1–9](../02/01.md)), and an epilogue telling how the people responded to the message of the book and what Yahweh promised them ([3:16–4:6](../03/01.md)).\n\n### What is the book of Malachi about?\n\nThe book of Malachi contains prophecies that address the Jews who had returned to Judah from exile in Babylon. At that time, the Jews were discouraged even though they had finished building a new temple. The wonderful things that previous prophets had promised for Judah had not yet happened. The Persian Empire still ruled over them. As a result, they no longer were concerned about the law or worshiping Yahweh. These prophecies rebuke the Judeans for not living as the law taught and for not bringing proper tithes and sacrifices. But the prophecies also assure the Judeans that Yahweh will ultimately do everything that he promised to do.\n\n### Who wrote the book of Malachi?\n\nThe description in the book title ([1:1](../01/01.md)) could either be translated “the word of Yahweh to Israel by the hand of Malachi” or “the word of Yahweh to Israel by the hand of my messenger.” The last expression in that sentence also occurs in [3:1](../03/01.md), where the context indicates that it should be translated as “my messenger.” However, the expression could well be the name of the man in the book title. That man would be the prophet who delivered these messages on behalf of Yahweh. However, we do not know anything else about this man—where he lived, what family he came from, etc. Translating the expression as a name is the most common interpretation, and that is the interpretation that the ULT and these notes follow. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to follow the interpretation that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to follow the same interpretation as the ULT.\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nThis book traditionally has been titled “Malachi” or “The Book of Malachi.” Translators may decide to call it something like “The Sayings of Malachi” or “The Messages that Malachi Brought.”\n\n## Part 2: Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### The “day of Yahweh”\n\nThe book of Malachi speaks about the “day of Yahweh” in [3:2–5](../03/02.md) and [3:17–4:6](../03/01.md). It also calls it “the day that is coming” and “the day of his coming,” and Yahweh calls it “the day that I am preparing.” All of these are references to the time when Yahweh will come and judge people. He would remove those who have wickedly sinned and bless those who have trusted in him. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/dayofthelord]])\n\n## Part 3: Translation Issues\n\n### “But you say”\n\nIn each of the six thematic sections of the book, the prophet makes a statement that challenges the people and gets their attention. Its meaning is not immediately clear. The prophet then anticipates how the people will respond. He introduces their likely response with the phrase “But you say” ([1:2](../01/02.md), [1:6](../01/06.md), [1:7](../01/07.md), [1:13](../01/13.md), [2:14](../02/14.md), [2:17](../02/17.md), [3:7](../03/07.md), [3:8](../03/08.md), [3:13](../03/13.md)). After saying how he expects they would respond, he then explains what his provocative statement meant. This was a common practice of Jewish public speakers in this time period (and also in New Testament times). The phrase “But you say” occurs throughout the book as Malachi anticipates and answers objections. It would be helpful to translate the phrase consistently so that your readers can appreciate the method he is using to challenge the Judeans.\n\n### Yahweh of Armies\n\nThis is an important title of God that is used more than 20 times throughout the book of Malachi. It reminds the listeners of the great power that Yahweh has to judge and punish all nations. Be sure to translate it consistently throughout the book so that your readers can appreciate the emphasis that Malachi places on it. (See: [[rc://*/tw/dict/bible/kt/yahwehofhosts]])

1:1	m3x2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מַשָּׂ֥א דְבַר־יְהוָ֖ה	1	The editor of the book is speaking as if the **word of Yahweh** were a **burden** that Malachi was carrying. This is likely a reference to the serious nature of what Yahweh told Malachi to say. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [The serious word from Yahweh]
1:1	k9f4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	דְבַר־יְהוָ֖ה	1	The editor is using the word **word** by association to mean what Yahweh said by using words. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [what Yahweh said]
1:1	p2r7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	אֶל־יִשְׂרָאֵ֑ל	1	Since Malachi is referring to a group of people, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **Israel**. Alternate translation: [to the Israelites]
1:1	w5h8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	בְּ⁠יַ֖ד	1	The author is using one part of Malachi, his **hand**, to mean all of him in the act of bringing Yahweh’s message to the Israelites. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression from your culture or plain language. Alternate translation: [through]
1:1	t6j9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	מַלְאָכִֽי	1	These notes follow the interpretation that the word **Malachi** is the name of a man. See the further discussion in the  introduction to Malachi.
1:2	uz1w		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	אָהַ֤בְתִּי אֶתְ⁠כֶם֙ אָמַ֣ר יְהוָ֔ה	1	In your translation, use a natural way of introducing direct quotations in your language. Alternate translation: [Yahweh says, “I have loved you”]
1:2	l1n3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	אֶתְ⁠כֶם֙	1	The word **you** is plural here because Yahweh is addressing the Israelites as a group, so use the plural form in your translation if your language marks that distinction. The words “you,” “your,” and “yourselves” are usually plural in this book when they refer to the Israelites. These notes will indicate any exceptions. The word “you” is always singular when it refers to Yahweh.
1:2	q7m5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וַ⁠אֲמַרְתֶּ֖ם	1	Malachi is probably not quoting an actual response from the Judeans. Rather, he is anticipating an objection, stating it, and then answering it. See the further discussion in the introduction to Malachi. Alternate translation: [Now you may object]
1:2	vkrw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	הֲ⁠לוֹא־אָ֨ח עֵשָׂ֤ו לְ⁠יַֽעֲקֹב֙ נְאֻם־יְהוָ֔ה וָ⁠אֹהַ֖ב אֶֽת־יַעֲקֹֽב	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could change the order of these phrases so that the speaker, **Yahweh**, is identified before we read the words which he speaks. Alternate translation: [Yahweh declares, “Was not Esau a brother to Jacob? Yet I loved Jacob”]
1:2	x4d6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠לוֹא־אָ֨ח עֵשָׂ֤ו לְ⁠יַֽעֲקֹב֙	1	Yahweh is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [Now Esau was Jacob’s brother]
1:2	b2k8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הֲ⁠לוֹא־אָ֨ח עֵשָׂ֤ו לְ⁠יַֽעֲקֹב֙	1	Yahweh is using the names **Esau** and **Jacob** by association to mean their descendants. Alternate translation: [Are the Edomites not a related people group to you Israelites?] or [Now the Edomites are a related people group to you Israelites]
1:2	h9f1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	נְאֻם־יְהוָ֔ה	1	This phrase indicates that this is a direct quotation from Yahweh. In your translation, use a natural way of introducing direct quotations in your language. Alternate translation: [Yahweh declares]
1:2	v3r5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	וָ⁠אֹהַ֖ב אֶֽת־יַעֲקֹֽב	1	Yahweh is referring to the Israelites as a group by using the name of their ancestor, **Jacob**. Alternate translation: [Yet I loved you Israelites]
1:2-3	xu00		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-poetry	וָ⁠אֹהַ֖ב אֶֽת־יַעֲקֹֽב׃ וְ⁠אֶת־עֵשָׂ֖ו שָׂנֵ֑אתִי	1	Here the author uses a poetic device called a chiasm, which Hebrew writers often used in poetry and literature. The outer phrases **I loved** and **I hated** parallel each other and the inner words, **Jacob** and **Esau** parallel each other. So the pattern is ABBA. If it is possible in your language you should try to retain this order.
1:3	c7m2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וְ⁠אֶת־עֵשָׂ֖ו שָׂנֵ֑אתִי	1	The word translated as **hated** does not always indicate a strong antipathy or loathing. In a comparison such as this one, it can mean “loved less” or “favored less.” If it would help your readers, you could indicate that explicitly. Alternate translation: [but I have not favored Esau or his descendants, the Edomites]
1:3	g6n9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	שְׁמָמָ֔ה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **desolation**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [a desolate place]
1:3	z8k4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	לְ⁠תַנּ֥וֹת	1	A **jackal** is a wild dog that lives in the desert. If your readers would not be familiar with what a jackal is, in your translation you could use the name of a similar animal that your readers would recognize, or you could use a general expression. Alternate translation: [desert scavengers]
1:4	b2tn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	כִּֽי־תֹאמַ֨ר אֱד֜וֹם	1	The word **Edom** is another name for “Esau.” Yahweh uses the word **Edom** by association to mean Esau’s descendants. If it would be helpful to your readers you could state this plainly. Alternate translation: [Though the Edomites say]
1:4	y2p7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	רֻשַּׁ֗שְׁנוּ	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [Our enemies have beaten us down]
1:4	f5s1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	וְ⁠קָרְא֤וּ לָ⁠הֶם֙ גְּב֣וּל רִשְׁעָ֔ה וְ⁠הָ⁠עָ֛ם אֲשֶׁר־זָעַ֥ם יְהוָ֖ה עַד־עוֹלָֽם	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there are not quotations within a quotation. Alternate translation: [And people will say that they are a territory where wicked people live and that they are a people whom Yahweh abhors forever]
1:4	d9h3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠קָרְא֤וּ לָ⁠הֶם֙	1	Here, **they** is an indefinite pronoun that does not have a specific referent in the immediate context. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this with a different expression that does not use an indefinite pronoun, as modeled by the UST.
1:4	j1w6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	גְּב֣וּל רִשְׁעָ֔ה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **wickedness**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [the wicked territory] or [the territory where wicked people live]
1:5	a8b3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	וְ⁠עֵינֵי⁠כֶ֖ם תִּרְאֶ֑ינָה וְ⁠אַתֶּ֤ם תֹּֽאמְרוּ֙ יִגְדַּ֣ל יְהוָ֔ה מֵ⁠עַ֖ל לִ⁠גְב֥וּל יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	The words in this verse could: (1) be a continuation of Yahweh’s words that began in the previous verse. If you treat this as a quotation from Yahweh, it may be more natural in your language not to have a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: [And your eyes will see, and you yourselves will say that Yahweh is great beyond the border of Israel]; (2) the words of Malachi. If you choose this option, you will need to add closing quotes at the end of the previous verse or whatever means your language uses to end a quotation, and use whatever punctuation your language requires to indicate that Malachi is speaking. Alternate translation: [And your eyes will see, and you yourselves will say, “Great is Yahweh beyond the border of Israel”]
1:5	n4t8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	וְ⁠עֵינֵי⁠כֶ֖ם תִּרְאֶ֑ינָה	1	Yahweh is using one part of the Judeans, their **eyes**, to represent all of them in the act of seeing. The emphasis is on their eyewitness experience. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [And you will see for yourselves]
1:5	zzu7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	וְ⁠עֵינֵי⁠כֶ֖ם תִּרְאֶ֑ינָה וְ⁠אַתֶּ֤ם תֹּֽאמְרוּ֙ יִגְדַּ֣ל יְהוָ֔ה מֵ⁠עַ֖ל לִ⁠גְב֥וּל יִשְׂרָאֵֽל	1	It may be more natural in your language to have Yahweh speak of himself in the first person rather than in the third person. Alternate translation: [And your eyes will see, and you yourselves will say that I am great beyond the border of Israel!]
1:6	r2k9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וְ⁠אִם־אָ֣ב אָ֣נִי אַיֵּ֣ה כְבוֹדִ֡⁠י וְ⁠אִם־אֲדוֹנִ֣ים אָנִי֩ אַיֵּ֨ה מוֹרָאִ֜⁠י	1	Yahweh is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [Since I am a father, you should honor me. And since I am a master, you should fear me]
1:6	u6v1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	שְׁמִ֔⁠י & אֶת־שְׁמֶֽ⁠ךָ	1	Yahweh is using the word **name** by association to mean his reputation and authority. Alternate translation: [my reputation … your reputation] or [my authority … your authority]
1:7	o3d8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	לֶ֣חֶם מְגֹאָ֔ל	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [food that people have made unfit for sacrifice]
1:7	q1j6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	וַ⁠אֲמַרְתֶּ֖ם בַּ⁠מֶּ֣ה גֵֽאַלְנ֑וּ⁠ךָ בֶּ⁠אֱמָרְ⁠כֶ֕ם שֻׁלְחַ֥ן יְהוָ֖ה נִבְזֶ֥ה הֽוּא	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there are not quotations within a quotation. Alternate translation: [But you ask how you have defiled me. You defile me by saying that you can despise the table of Yahweh]
1:7	a3h2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	שֻׁלְחַ֥ן יְהוָ֖ה נִבְזֶ֥ה הֽוּא	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [One may despise the table of Yahweh]
1:7	b7c4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	שֻׁלְחַ֥ן יְהוָ֖ה	1	Yahweh is speaking as if the altar on which the priests offered sacrifices to him were a **table** at which he ate food. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [The altar of Yahweh]
1:8	r8n4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וְ⁠כִֽי־תַגִּשׁ֨וּ⁠ן עִוֵּ֤ר לִ⁠זְבֹּ֨חַ֙ אֵ֣ין רָ֔ע וְ⁠כִ֥י תַגִּ֛ישׁוּ פִּסֵּ֥חַ וְ⁠חֹלֶ֖ה אֵ֣ין רָ֑ע	1	Yahweh is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [When you present blind animals for sacrifice, that is evil! And when you present lame and sick animals, that is also evil!]
1:8	g2m7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	עִוֵּ֤ר & פִּסֵּ֥חַ וְ⁠חֹלֶ֖ה	1	Yahweh is not referring to specific blind, lame, or sick animals. He means animals with these conditions in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: [blind animals … lame and sick animals]
1:8	p9k1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	הַקְרִיבֵ֨⁠הוּ	1	The pronoun **it** refers to the blind, lame, and sick animals. It may be more natural in your language to use a plural expression. Alternate translation: [Present these animals]
1:8	y6s3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	לְ⁠פֶחָתֶ֗⁠ךָ הֲ⁠יִּרְצְ⁠ךָ֙ & פָנֶ֔י⁠ךָ	1	The words **you** and **your** are singular here because Yahweh is addressing the priests as a collective group. This suits the context, since that is how they were ruled by their **governor**. It may be natural for you to use the singular form in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
1:8	r4f8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠יִּרְצְ⁠ךָ֙ א֚וֹ הֲ⁠יִשָּׂ֣א פָנֶ֔י⁠ךָ	1	Yahweh is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [He certainly will not accept you or lift up your face!]
1:8	d7h5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	הֲ⁠יִּרְצְ⁠ךָ֙ א֚וֹ הֲ⁠יִשָּׂ֣א פָנֶ֔י⁠ךָ	1	The terms **accept you** and **lift up your face** mean similar things. Yahweh is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: [He certainly will not show you any favor at all!]
1:8	i3l9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	א֚וֹ הֲ⁠יִשָּׂ֣א פָנֶ֔י⁠ךָ	1	This is an expression that people of this culture would commonly use to mean “show favor.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [or show you favor]
1:9	a9n2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	וְ⁠עַתָּ֛ה	1	The word the ULT translated as **And now** is an expression that was used in messages of this time to introduce important points. If your language has a comparable expression that it uses for this same purpose, you can use it in your translation.
1:9	t5m1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-123person	פְנֵי־אֵ֖ל וִֽ⁠יחָנֵ֑⁠נוּ	1	Malachi attributes this quotation to Yahweh, but it is something that Yahweh told him to say to the priests. So you could translate it with Malachi as the speaker. However, if you translate it with Yahweh as the speaker, he would be speaking about himself in the third person. If it would be more natural in your language, you could translate it in the first person. Alternate translation: [my face, that I may be gracious to you]
1:9	s2k7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	פְנֵי־אֵ֖ל	1	Yahweh is using one part of himself, his **face**, to mean all of him in the act of looking with favor on someone who was praying to him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [God]
1:9	e1f6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	פְנֵי־אֵ֖ל	1	Malachi is probably using the term **God** here to contrast with the mention of “the governor” in the previous verse. The implication is that if people would not offer inferior gifts to a human being, they should certainly not offer them to God. So here it would be appropriate to use your language’s term for the true God who created the world rather than using the name Yahweh.
1:9	e8x4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive	וִֽ⁠יחָנֵ֑⁠נוּ	1	Malachi is using the pronoun **us** to refer to himself and his listeners, so use the inclusive form of that word if your language marks that distinction. (If you are treating this as a direct quotation from Yahweh, you may use the plural form of “you.”)
1:9	p1j6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	מִ⁠יֶּדְ⁠כֶם֙ הָ֣יְתָה זֹּ֔את	1	The pronoun **This** refers to the unacceptable sacrifices. It may be helpful to clarify the referent for your readers. Alternate translation: [These unacceptable sacrifices have been from your hand]
1:9	s7f2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	מִ⁠יֶּדְ⁠כֶם֙	1	Malachi is using one part of the priests‘ bodies, the **hand**, to mean all of themselves in the act of offering sacrifices. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [from you]
1:9	f2g9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	מִ⁠יֶּדְ⁠כֶם֙	1	Since Malachi is referring to a group of people, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **hand**. Alternate translation: [from your hands]
1:9	i5h9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	הֲ⁠יִשָּׂ֤א מִ⁠כֶּם֙ פָּנִ֔ים	1	See how you translated the similar expression in [1:8](../01/08.md).
1:9	r3n8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֲ⁠יִשָּׂ֤א מִ⁠כֶּם֙ פָּנִ֔ים	1	Yahweh is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [He certainly will not lift your faces!] or [He will certainly not show you favor!]
1:10	u9w2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מִ֤י גַם־בָּ⁠כֶם֙ וְ⁠יִסְגֹּ֣ר דְּלָתַ֔יִם וְ⁠לֹֽא־תָאִ֥ירוּ מִזְבְּחִ֖⁠י חִנָּ֑ם	1	Yahweh is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [I wish one of you would shut the temple doors, so that you would not kindle useless fires on my altar!]
1:10	e3m7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	דְּלָתַ֔יִם	1	Yahweh assumes that his listeners will know that by **the doors** he means the doors of the temple. You could say that explicitly if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [the doors of the temple]
1:10	c8n2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	אֶרְצֶ֥ה מִ⁠יֶּדְ⁠כֶֽם	1	Since Yahweh is referring to a group of people, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **hand**. Alternate translation: [offerings from your hands]
1:10	s6p4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	מִ⁠יֶּדְ⁠כֶֽם	1	Yahweh is using one part of the priests‘ bodies, the **hand**, to mean all of themselves in the act of offering sacrifices. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [that you give]
1:11	m2t7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מִ⁠מִּזְרַח־שֶׁ֜מֶשׁ וְ⁠עַד־מְבוֹא֗⁠וֹ	1	Yahweh is using the **rising** and **setting** of the **sun** by association to mean the east and the west. Alternate translation: [from the east to the west]
1:11	m9r3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	מִ⁠מִּזְרַח־שֶׁ֜מֶשׁ וְ⁠עַד־מְבוֹא֗⁠וֹ	1	Yahweh is speaking of two extremes in order to include them and everything in between. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [everywhere in the world]
1:11	n4f8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	גָּד֤וֹל שְׁמִ⁠י֙ & גָד֤וֹל שְׁמִ⁠י֙	1	Yahweh is using the word **name** by association to mean his reputation. See how you translated the same expression in [1:6](../01/06.md). Alternate translation: [my reputation will be great … my reputation will be great]
1:11	r6qa		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	גָּד֤וֹל שְׁמִ⁠י֙	1	The Hebrew text leaves out a verb in this phrase. Many languages require a verb to make this phrase complete. If it would be helpful in your language, you could supply the verb from the context. The verb that needs to be supplied could be: (1) future tense, “will be.” (2) present tense, “is.” Alternate translation: [my name is great]
1:11	s7h1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	לִ⁠שְׁמִ֖⁠י	1	Yahweh is using one part of himself, his **name**, to mean all of him. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [to me]
1:12	p2k6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וְ⁠אַתֶּ֖ם מְחַלְּלִ֣ים אוֹת֑⁠וֹ	1	Here, the pronoun **it** refers to Yahweh’s name or reputation.

It may be that in the earlier instance Yahweh is speaking of himself in the third person, while in this instance Yahweh is quoting what the priests would say. (In order not to misuse his name, Jews would use this title instead.) Some versions of the Bible use their representation of the divine name here, since that is what the priests meant. Other versions use the title **Lord** to reflect this Jewish practice and the original text of the book. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.

2:intro	jc2b				0	# Malachi 2 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n2:1–9 Priests must teach and apply the law faithfully\n\n2:10–16 Yahweh is concerned for justice: no divorce\n\n[2:17](../02/17.md)–[3:5](../03/05.md) Yahweh is concerned for justice and will punish evildoers\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### “My covenant was with him, life and peace, and I gave them to him {for} fear” ([2:5](../02/05.md))\n\nHere Yahweh seems to be alluding implicitly to what he said in [Numbers 25:12–13](../../num/25/12.md), that he was making a **covenant** of **peace** establishing Phineas (the son of the first high priest, Aaron) and his descendants in the priesthood permanently. Yahweh did this because Phineas zealously opposed the worship of foreign gods. That is what Yahweh means here by “I gave them to him for fear.” He is saying, in other words, “because he worshiped me exclusively and devotedly.” Yahweh was punishing the Israelites for this idol-worship with a plague that was killing many of them, but he ended the plague because of what Phineas did. So this was a covenant of **peace** (Yahweh was no longer hostile to the Israelites). It was also a covenant of **life** (Yahweh was no longer punishing the Israelites with death). The word **life** may also reflect that this was a permanent covenant that would not end. The notes to [2:5](../02/05.md) suggest ways to translate these statements.\n\n## Translation Issues\n\n### And did he not make one ([2:15](../02/15.md)a)\n\nHere are two views Bible scholars have regarding the correct interpretation of these words. (1) The word **one** refers to the close connection a husband and wife have. Alternate translation: [And did not God make you one with your wife?]; (2) The word **one** refers to God. Alternate translation: [And did not the one God make you]\n\n### and a remnant of spirit {was} to him? ([2:15](../02/15.md)b)\n\nHere are two views, among many, that Bible scholars have regarding the correct interpretation of these words. (1) These words mean that a husband and wife are united in body and spirit. Alternate translation: [God made you to become united with your wife in body and spirit]; (2) These words mean that the bodies and spirits of a husband and wife belong to God. Alternate translation: [and you and your wife belong to God]\n\n### “and one {who} covers over his garment with violence” ([2:16](../02/16.md))\n\nHere are three views Bible scholars have regarding the correct interpretation of these words. (1) it means that husband and wife Malachi is speaking as if **violence** were a substance with which a person could cover a **garment**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. The idea of complete covering conveys emphasis. Alternate translation: [and one who acts very violently]; (2) The word **violence** refers to harsh actions that could include actions other than divorce. Alternate translation: [and one who acts violently]; (3) The word **violence** refers to violent or cruel actions which a person conceals. Alternate translation: [and one who conceals their violence]

2:2	b1c6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אָרוֹתִ֔י⁠הָ	1	Since the pronoun **it** refers back to **blessings**, it may be more natural in your language to use a plural form. Alternate translation: [I have cursed them]

2:10	z1b4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אִ֣ישׁ בְּ⁠אָחִ֔י⁠ו	1	This is an expression that people of this culture would commonly use to mean that people were acting against others of their own community. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [people against others of their own community]
2:10	d1f3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֲבֹתֵֽי⁠נוּ	1	Malachi is speaking of the ancestors of the Israelites as if they were the **fathers** of the current generation. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [our forefathers]

If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine them. Alternate translation: [The people of Judah are doing treacherous things in Israel and in Jerusalem]
2:11	l3n6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	בָּגְדָ֣ה יְהוּדָ֔ה & חִלֵּ֣ל יְהוּדָ֗ה	1	Since Malachi is referring to a group of people, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form. Alternate translation: [The people of Judah have dealt treacherously … The people of Judah have profaned]
2:11	q5s9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	וְ⁠תוֹעֵבָ֛ה נֶעֶשְׂתָ֥ה בְ⁠יִשְׂרָאֵ֖ל וּ⁠בִ⁠ירֽוּשָׁלִָ֑ם	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [and the people have done an abomination in Israel and in Jerusalem] or [and the people have committed an abomination in Israel and in Jerusalem]
2:11	u1w4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ⁠בָעַ֖ל בַּת־אֵ֥ל נֵכָֽר	1	Malachi is speaking as if foreign gods had **daughters** that the people of Judah could **marry**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. This could mean: (1) that the Judeans have allied themselves closely with foreign gods as their worshipers, as if they had made a marriage alliance the way kingdoms did. Alternate translation: [and has worshiped foreign gods]; (2) that Judean men have married foreign women, and this has led them to worship foreign gods. Alternate translation: [and Judean men have married foreign women and begun to worship their gods]
2:12	x3z7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	יַכְרֵ֨ת יְהוָ֜ה & מֵ⁠אָהֳלֵ֖י יַֽעֲקֹ֑ב	1	Malachi is describing the people of Israel by association with their ancestor **Jacob**, who was also known as Israel. Alternate translation: [May Yahweh cut off from the tents of the people of Israel]
2:12	b5d8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	יַכְרֵ֨ת יְהוָ֜ה	1	The expression **cut off** is one that people of this culture would commonly use to mean to “remove.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [May Yahweh remove]
2:12	f9h3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מֵ⁠אָהֳלֵ֖י יַֽעֲקֹ֑ב	1	Malachi is using the word **tents** by association to mean the community of **Israel**. Alternate translation: [from the community of Israel]
2:12	j3l6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	לָ⁠אִ֨ישׁ	1	Here the masculine term **man** has a generic sense that includes both men and women. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use language in your translation that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: [anyone]
2:12	n1q4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	עֵ֣ר וְ⁠עֹנֶ֔ה	1	Malachi is speaking of two extremes in order to include them and everything in between. He is alluding to a watchman guarding a city at night (**the one being awake**) and someone approaching the city who is responding to the challenge, “Who is there?” (**the one answering**). If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [no matter who he is]
2:13	r3t7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	כַּסּ֤וֹת דִּמְעָה֙ אֶת־מִזְבַּ֣ח יְהוָ֔ה	1	Malachi is making an overstatement for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the emphasis in a different way. Alternate translation: [weeping profusely at the altar of Yahweh]
2:13	v5x8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	פְּנוֹת֙ אֶל־הַ⁠מִּנְחָ֔ה וְ⁠לָ⁠קַ֥חַת רָצ֖וֹן מִ⁠יֶּדְ⁠כֶֽם	1	These two phrases mean basically the same thing. Malachi uses them together to emphasize how Yahweh is rejecting the offerings. If it would be clearer in your language, you could combine these phrases. Alternate translation: [accepting your offerings favorably]
2:13	y7z1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	פְּנוֹת֙ אֶל־הַ⁠מִּנְחָ֔ה	1	The phrase **turning to** is an expression that people of this culture would commonly use to mean “to pay attention to” or “to accept something.” If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [accepting the offering]
2:13	c3d6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-synecdoche	מִ⁠יֶּדְ⁠כֶֽם	1	Malachi is using one part of the people, their **hand**, to mean all of them in the act of offering sacrifices. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [from you] or [that you give]
2:14	g1i4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יְהוָה֩ הֵעִ֨יד בֵּינְ⁠ךָ֜ וּ⁠בֵ֣ין ׀ אֵ֣שֶׁת נְעוּרֶ֗י⁠ךָ	1	In this culture, when people made promises to one another, they often did this with witnesses watching. The role of those witnesses included holding the people to their promises. The Judean men had made covenant promises to their wives when they married them. Malachi assumes that those men will know that when he refers to Yahweh as a **witness**, he means that Yahweh is holding them to those promises. Yahweh is doing that by showing his disfavor through not accepting their offerings. You could indicate this explicitly in your translation if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [Because Yahweh is enforcing the covenant promises you made to the wife of your youth]
2:14	k5m8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	בֵּינְ⁠ךָ֜ & נְעוּרֶ֗י⁠ךָ & אַתָּה֙ בָּגַ֣דְתָּה & חֲבֶרְתְּ⁠ךָ֖ & בְּרִיתֶֽ⁠ךָ	1	Except for the first occurrence of the the word **you**, the words **you**, **your**, and **yourself** are singular in this verse because, even though Malachi is speaking to the Judeans as a group, he is addressing an individual situation. So use singular forms in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
2:14	o3q6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	אֵ֣שֶׁת נְעוּרֶ֗י⁠ךָ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **youth**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [the wife you married when you were young]
2:15	s1u4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וְ⁠לֹא־אֶחָ֣ד עָשָׂ֗ה וּ⁠שְׁאָ֥ר ר֨וּחַ֙ ל֔⁠וֹ	1	Malachi is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. See the introduction to this chapter for a discussion of this sentence. Alternate translation: [After all, he made one, and a remnant of spirit was to him!]
2:15	yyy8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	וּ⁠שְׁאָ֥ר ר֨וּחַ֙ ל֔⁠וֹ	1	The pronoun **him** refers back to the pronoun **one**, meaning the husband and the wife. It may be more natural in your language to use a plural pronoun. See the introduction to this chapter for a discussion of this clause. Alternate translation: [and a remnant of spirit was to them]
2:15	w5y8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וּ⁠מָה֙ הָֽ⁠אֶחָ֔ד מְבַקֵּ֖שׁ זֶ֣רַע אֱלֹהִ֑ים	1	Malachi is not asking the question **And why one?** to get information. Rather, he is asking and then answering his own question. This was a common practice of Jewish public speakers in this time period (and also in New Testament times). Alternate translation: [And I will tell you why he made one: he was seeking seed of God]
2:15	z3b6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	זֶ֣רַע אֱלֹהִ֑ים	1	Malachi is using this possessive form to mean offspring that would be faithful to God. It may be helpful to clarify this for your readers. Alternate translation: [offspring that would be faithful to God]
2:15	d5f8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠נִשְׁמַרְתֶּם֙ בְּ⁠ר֣וּחֲ⁠כֶ֔ם	1	Malachi is speaking as if a person’s **spirit** were a physical place where they could be **guarded**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [So be careful about your attitudes]
2:16	h3j6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠כִסָּ֤ה חָמָס֙ עַל־לְבוּשׁ֔⁠וֹ	1	For a discussion of the phrase **covers his garment with violence** and suggestions for how to translate it, see the introduction to this chapter.

2:17	l7n1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠דִבְרֵי⁠כֶ֔ם	1	Yahweh is using the term **words** by association to mean what the people are saying. Alternate translation: [by what you are saying]
2:17	q9s2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	עֹ֨שֵׂה רָ֜ע	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **evil**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [the people who do evil things]
2:17	u3w6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בְּ⁠עֵינֵ֣י יְהוָ֗ה	1	Malachi is using the word **eyes** by association to mean sight. Sight, by association, represents judgment and perspective. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [in Yahweh’s perspective]
2:17	x7z1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	אַיֵּ֖ה אֱלֹהֵ֥י הַ⁠מִּשְׁפָּֽט	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **justice**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [Where is the God who judges fairly?]
2:17	b9d2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	אַיֵּ֖ה אֱלֹהֵ֥י הַ⁠מִּשְׁפָּֽט	1	The people are using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [God is not punishing people who do not act justly]

3:1	f5h8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	הִנְ⁠נִ֤י שֹׁלֵחַ֙	1	**Behold me** is an expression that people of this culture would commonly use to mean that they were about to do something. See how you translated the similar expression in [2:3](../02/03.md). Alternate translation: [Now I am about to send]
3:1	j7l1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וּ⁠פִנָּה־דֶ֖רֶךְ לְ⁠פָנָ֑⁠י	1	Yahweh is using the word **face** to mean his presence by association with the way people can see the face of someone who is present. Alternate translation: [and he will prepare the way for me to be present among you]
3:1	n3q6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ⁠פִנָּה־דֶ֖רֶךְ לְ⁠פָנָ֑⁠י	1	Yahweh is speaking of his coming as if it were a journey for which a **way** needed to be prepared. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [and he will get things ready for my coming]
3:1	r5t8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הִנֵּה	1	Yahweh uses this word to get the people’s attention. See how you translated a similar use of this word in [1:13](../01/13.md). Alternate translation: [pay attention]

Alternate translation: [He will be like the fire of a refiner and like the soap of launderers. So who will be able to endure the day of his coming? And who will be able to stand when he appears?]
3:2	y1z4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	וּ⁠מִ֤י מְכַלְכֵּל֙ אֶת־י֣וֹם בּוֹא֔⁠וֹ וּ⁠מִ֥י הָ⁠עֹמֵ֖ד בְּ⁠הֵרָֽאוֹת֑⁠וֹ	1	Yahweh is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [No one will be able to endure the day of his coming! No one will be able to stand when he appears!]

The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. It may be clearer in your language to connect the phrases with a word other than “and” in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternate translation: [No one will be able to endure the day of his coming! Indeed, no one will be able to stand when he appears!]
3:2	g3i6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הָ⁠עֹמֵ֖ד	1	Yahweh is using the image of **standing** to speak of a person being declared innocent. The idea is that if he were declared guilty, that would be like a weight too heavy for the person to carry, and the person would sink down under it. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [will be declared innocent]
3:2	k7m1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	הוּא֙ כְּ⁠אֵ֣שׁ מְצָרֵ֔ף וּ⁠כְ⁠בֹרִ֖ית מְכַבְּסִֽים	1	The point of this comparison is that just as fire refines metal and soap cleans clothes, so the messenger will purify the people, that is, he will help them forsake the sins they have been committing. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: [just as fire refines metal and soap cleans clothes, he will purify people by helping them stop sinning]
3:3	o5q8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠יָשַׁ֨ב מְצָרֵ֤ף וּ⁠מְטַהֵר֙ כֶּ֔סֶף	1	Yahweh is speaking as if the messenger were going to be a metalworker who was **refining** and **purifying** precious metals. Since he expresses this same image as a comparison in the next clause, you may wish to present it as a comparison here as well. Alternate translation: [Yes, in that way he will be like someone who sits refining and purifying silver]
3:3	s3u6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֶת־בְּנֵֽי־לֵוִי֙	1	Yahweh is speaking as if these priests were the **sons** of their ancestor **Levi**. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [the descendants of Levi who are priests]

Alternate translation: [and he will purify the people from sin just as gold and silver are refined to remove impurities from them]
3:4	z5b8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	מִנְחַ֥ת יְהוּדָ֖ה וִ⁠ירֽוּשָׁלִָ֑ם	1	Since Yahweh is referring to a group of people, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form. Alternate translation: [the offerings of the people of Judah and Jerusalem]

Alternate translation: [against those who, because they do not fear me, are sorcerers or adulterers or swear to a lie or oppress the wage of the hired worker, the widow, and the orphan or turn aside the foreigner]
3:5	l1n4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	לַ⁠מִּשְׁפָּט֒	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **judgment**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [as a judge]

If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [And I will declare people guilty and punish them for what they have done wrong, including sorcerers, adulterers, those who swear to a lie, those who oppress the wage of the hired worker, the widow, and the orphan, and those who turn aside the foreigner]
3:5	u5w8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וּ⁠בְ⁠עֹשְׁקֵ֣י שְׂכַר	1	Yahweh is speaking of **wage** as if it were a person who could be oppressed.

3:5	x1z4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	שָׂ֠כִיר אַלְמָנָ֨ה וְ⁠יָת֤וֹם & גֵר֙	1	Here, **the hired worker** and **the widow** and **the orphan** and **the foreigner** represent hired workers, widows, orphans, and foreigners in general, not a specific **hired worker** or **widow** or **orphan** or **foreigner**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use more natural expressions. Alternate translation: [hired workers, widows, orphans … foreigners]
3:5	b3d6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ⁠מַטֵּי־גֵר֙	1	Yahweh is speaking of denying justice to foreigners as if people who did that were **turning** them **aside** from a road they were walking on and needed to stay on. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [and those who deny justice to foreigners]
3:6	f7h1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublenegatives	כִּ֛י אֲנִ֥י יְהוָ֖ה לֹ֣א שָׁנִ֑יתִי וְ⁠אַתֶּ֥ם בְּנֵֽי־יַעֲקֹ֖ב לֹ֥א כְלִיתֶֽם	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could use a positive expression to translate the double negatives **do not change** and **have not come to an end**. Alternate translation: [It is only because I, Yahweh, have remained the same that you, sons of Jacob, are still a people group]
3:6	j1l4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	לֹ֣א שָׁנִ֑יתִי	1	Yahweh assumes that the Judeans will understand that when he says that he does **not change**, he means that he always keeps his promises. He promised Abraham that he would bless his descendants, and so he is still taking care of them, even though they have been disobedient. You could say that explicitly if it would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [always keep my promises] or [intend to keep my promise to Abraham to bless his descendants]
3:6	n5q8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	בְּנֵֽי־יַעֲקֹ֖ב	1	Yahweh is speaking of the Israelites as if they were the **sons** of their ancestor Jacob. See how you translated the similar expression in [3:3](../03/03.md). Alternate translation: [descendants of Jacob]

Rather, he is asking and then answering his own question. See how you translated the similar instance in [2:15](../02/15.md). Alternate translation: [It does not seem that a human would dare to rob God, yet you are robbing me]
3:8	k1m4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	וַ⁠אֲמַרְתֶּ֖ם בַּ⁠מֶּ֣ה קְבַעֲנ֑וּ⁠ךָ	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: [But you ask how you have robbed me]
3:8	o7q1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	הַֽ⁠מַּעֲשֵׂ֖ר וְ⁠הַ⁠תְּרוּמָֽה	1	Yahweh is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need in order to be complete. You can supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: [You have robbed me in the tithe and the contribution]
3:9	s5u8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	בַּ⁠מְּאֵרָה֙ אַתֶּ֣ם נֵֽאָרִ֔ים וְ⁠אֹתִ֖⁠י אַתֶּ֣ם קֹבְעִ֑ים	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes.

Alternate translation: [You are solemnly cursed] or [I have solemnly cursed you]
3:9	d1f4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	הַ⁠גּ֖וֹי כֻּלּֽ⁠וֹ	1	The pronoun **it** refers to the nation of Israel and specifically to the Judeans of that nationality whom Yahweh is addressing.
