The prophet Joel told them to understand it as an expression of the “day of Yahweh,” the occasion on which Yahweh would judge people and punish them for disobedience or reward them for obedience. Joel did not mean that the end of the world had come, but that the people should recognize that Yahweh was acting in judgment as he would at the end of the world. As the book progresses, Joel moves from his spiritual interpretation of the current locust plague to talking about the actual end of the world and final judgment. The apostles of Jesus understood some of Joel’s prophecies to have been fulfilled in their own day. In [Acts 2:17](../../act/02/17.md) and [2:21](../02/21.md), Peter quoted [Joel 2:28](../02/28.md) and [2:32](../02/32.md), where Yahweh says, “I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh” and “everyone who calls on the name of Yahweh will be saved.”\n\n### How should the title of this book be translated?\n\nThe traditional title of this book is “The Book of Joel” or just “Joel.” Translators may also call it the “The Message from Joel” or “The Sayings of Joel.”\n\n### Who wrote the book of Joel?\n\nThis book contains the prophecies of an Israelite named Joel. The title of the book states that he was the “son of Pethuel,” but it gives no further information about him. The book also does not tell when Joel prophesied.\n\n## Part 2: Religious and Cultural Concepts\n\n### The locust attack\n\nLocust attacks occurred often in the ancient Near East. Certain kinds of grasshoppers would come in countless numbers. There would be so many that they would darken the sky like a black cloud that blocked the sunlight. They often came after a long period of no rain. They came down on whatever crops were surviving in the fields and stripped them bare, eating all their leaves. The locusts could not be stopped, and they caused terrible damage. There are various names for locusts in the original language of the Old Testament. It is uncertain whether these refer to different kinds of locusts or to the same kind of locust in different stages of growth. For this reason, versions of the Bible differ in how they translate these terms. See the note to [1:4](../01/04.md) for a suggestion of how you might do this in your translation.\n\n## Part 3: Translation Issues\n\n### Representing the poetry of the book of Joel in your translation\n\nThe poetry in the book of Joel consists almost entirely of paired phrases that both mean basically the same thing. The second phrase emphasizes the meaning of the first phrase by repeating the same idea in different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. It may be clearer in your language to connect the phrases with a word other than “and” in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. For example, in [1:2](../01/02.md), you might say, “Hear this, you elders! Yes, listen, all of the dwellers of the land!” In [1:5](../01/05.md), you might say, “Wake up, drunkards, and weep! Indeed, wail, all of the drinkers of wine.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism]])\n\n### Litanies\n\nIn two places in the book, [1:4](../01/04.md) and [2:9](../02/09.md), Joel uses a repetitive series of similarly structured sentences for emphasis. This repetitive style of speaking or writing is called a “litany.” While in each case these brief litanies consist of two lines of poetry, in your translation you may wish to represent them as separate, shorter lines, as illustrated here. This would show the rhetorical device that Joel is employing. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litany]])\n\n[1:4](../01/04.md) The residue of the cutting locust,\n\n the swarming locust has eaten,\n\n and the residue of the swarming locust,\n\n the hopping locust has eaten,\n\n and the residue of the hopping locust,\n\n the destroying locust has eaten.\n\n[2:9](../02/09.md) Upon the city they rush,\n\n on the wall they run,\n\n into the houses they climb,\n\n through the windows they enter like thieves.\n\n### Speakers describe results before giving reasons\n\nThroughout their speeches in the book, both Joel and Yahweh typically describe a result before giving the reason for it. If it would be more natural in your language, in all or some of these cases, you could reverse the order and first present the phrase or clause that gives the reason, and then present the phrase or clause that gives the result. For example, in [1:17](../01/17.md), instead of saying, “The storehouses are desolate, the granaries have been broken down, for the grain has dried up,” you could say, “Because the grain has dried up, the storehouses are desolate, the granaries have been broken down.” In [2:21](../02/21.md), rather than saying, “Do not fear, land! Be glad and rejoice, for Yahweh has been great in doing,” you could say, “Yahweh has been great in doing! So do not fear, land. Be glad and rejoice.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])\n\n### Travel descriptions marked for change in elevation\n\nIn several places in the book ([1:6](../01/06.md), [3:2](../03/02.md), [3:9](../03/09.md), [3:11](../03/11.md), [3:12](../03/12.md)), the ULT includes the terms “up” or “down” in descriptions of travel. That shows how Hebrew marked such descriptions for changes in elevation. If your language does not do that, you could use expressions without “up” and “down.” For example, in [1:6](../01/06.md), you could use “a nation has come against my land” rather than “a nation has come up against my land.” (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])
1:intro	q2ev				0	# Joel 1 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nIn this chapter, Joel describes the effects of the locust attack and calls the people to mourn.\n\nBecause it is poetry, after the book title in [1:1](../01/01.md), the ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than its usual text.\n\n## Religious and Cultural Concepts in This Chapter\n\n### Locusts\n\nThis book starts very dramatically with the imagery of the locusts and the devastation that they produce. Five different kinds of locusts appear to come, and they progressively destroy the vegetation, including the crops, vineyards, and even the trees. It was common for farmers in the ancient Near East to experience large locust swarms that would come and eat all the crops in their fields. Translators should translate simply, presenting the scenes of locusts as Joel describes them.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### “House” meaning “temple”\n\nSeveral times in this chapter ([1:9](../01/09.md), [1:13](../01/13.md), [1:14](../01/14.md), [1:16](../01/16.md)), Joel uses the term “house” to mean Yahweh’s “temple.” He speaks of this temple as if it were a house in which God lived, since God’s presence was there. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])
1:1	a3b2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-names	פְּתוּאֵֽל	1	The word **Pethuel** is the name of a man.
1:1	ltl4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	דְּבַר־יְהוָה֙ אֲשֶׁ֣ר הָיָ֔ה	1	This is a common expression of this culture that means that Yahweh spoke a message to Joel. If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, you could use a comparable expression from your language that does have that meaning, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [The message that Yahweh spoke]
1:2	d6e9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	שִׁמְעוּ־זֹאת֙ הַ⁠זְּקֵנִ֔ים וְ⁠הַֽאֲזִ֔ינוּ כֹּ֖ל יוֹשְׁבֵ֣י הָ⁠אָ֑רֶץ	1	See the discussion in the introduction to Joel of how Hebrew poetry consisted of paired phrases that meant basically the same thing. Decide as a translation team how you will represent this poetry in your translation throughout the book of Joel. Alternate translation: [Hear this, you elders! Yes, listen, all of the dwellers of the land!]
1:2	q3r8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	הֶ⁠הָ֤יְתָה זֹּאת֙ בִּֽ⁠ימֵי⁠כֶ֔ם וְ⁠אִ֖ם בִּ⁠ימֵ֥י אֲבֹֽתֵי⁠כֶֽם	1	Joel is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [This has not happened in your days or in the days of your fathers!]
1:2	c9d2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	בִּֽ⁠ימֵי⁠כֶ֔ם וְ⁠אִ֖ם בִּ⁠ימֵ֥י	1	Joel is using the term **days** to mean a period of time by association with the way days make up longer periods of time. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [in your time or in the time of]
1:2	j001		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֲבֹֽתֵי⁠כֶֽם	1	Joel is not referring to the literal **fathers** of the Israelites whom he is addressing. He is using that term to mean their ancestors. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [your ancestors]
1:3	d4e9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-ellipsis	וּ⁠בְנֵי⁠כֶם֙ לִ⁠בְנֵי⁠הֶ֔ם וּ⁠בְנֵי⁠הֶ֖ם לְ⁠ד֥וֹר אַחֵֽר	1	Joel is leaving out some of the words that in many languages a sentence would need to be complete. You could supply these words from the context if that would be clearer in your language. Alternate translation: [and let your sons recount about it to their sons, and let their sons recount about it to the generation after]
1:3	f7g5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-gendernotations	לִ⁠בְנֵי⁠כֶ֣ם & וּ⁠בְנֵי⁠כֶם֙ לִ⁠בְנֵי⁠הֶ֔ם וּ⁠בְנֵי⁠הֶ֖ם	1	Here the masculine term **sons** has a generic sense that includes both male and female children. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could use language in your translation that is clearly inclusive of both men and women. Alternate translation: [to your children, and your children to their children, and their children]
1:3	s9t2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	עָלֶ֖⁠יהָ לִ⁠בְנֵי⁠כֶ֣ם סַפֵּ֑רוּ וּ⁠בְנֵי⁠כֶם֙	1	The imperative **Recount** and the word **your** are plural here because Joel is addressing the “elders” and “dwellers” mentioned in the previous verse. So use plural forms in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
1:4	h9j4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	יֶ֤תֶר הַ⁠גָּזָם֙ אָכַ֣ל הָֽ⁠אַרְבֶּ֔ה וְ⁠יֶ֥תֶר הָ⁠אַרְבֶּ֖ה אָכַ֣ל הַ⁠יָּ֑לֶק וְ⁠יֶ֣תֶר הַ⁠יֶּ֔לֶק אָכַ֖ל הֶ⁠חָסִֽיל	1	Joel is not referring to specific locusts of these types. He means locusts of these types in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using plural forms. Alternate translation: [The residue of the cutting locusts, swarming locusts have eaten, and the residue of the swarming locusts, hopping locusts have eaten, and the residue of the hopping locusts, destroying locusts have eaten]
1:4	m9p2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litany	יֶ֤תֶר הַ⁠גָּזָם֙ אָכַ֣ל הָֽ⁠אַרְבֶּ֔ה וְ⁠יֶ֥תֶר הָ⁠אַרְבֶּ֖ה אָכַ֣ל הַ⁠יָּ֑לֶק וְ⁠יֶ֣תֶר הַ⁠יֶּ֔לֶק אָכַ֖ל הֶ⁠חָסִֽיל	1	In the introduction to Joel, see the discussion of the litany form and how you might format this verse in your translation to show that Joel is using that form.
1:4	r2s6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-unknown	יֶ֤תֶר הַ⁠גָּזָם֙ אָכַ֣ל הָֽ⁠אַרְבֶּ֔ה וְ⁠יֶ֥תֶר הָ⁠אַרְבֶּ֖ה אָכַ֣ל הַ⁠יָּ֑לֶק וְ⁠יֶ֣תֶר הַ⁠יֶּ֔לֶק אָכַ֖ל הֶ⁠חָסִֽיל	1	The terms **cutting**, **swarming**, **hopping**, and **destroying** describe different kinds of locusts. Interpreters are not certain specifically what kinds of locusts these were. You may wish to use more general expressions in your translation. Alternate translation: [The residue of one kind of locust, another kind of locust has eaten, and the residue of that kind of locust, yet another kind of locust has eaten, and the residue of that kind of locust, still another kind of locust has eaten]
1:5	f2g7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result	הָקִ֤יצוּ שִׁכּוֹרִים֙ וּ⁠בְכ֔וּ וְ⁠הֵילִ֖לוּ כָּל־שֹׁ֣תֵי יָ֑יִן עַל־עָסִ֕יס כִּ֥י נִכְרַ֖ת מִ⁠פִּי⁠כֶֽם	1	See the discussion in the introduction to Joel of places such as this where the speaker describes a result before giving the reason for it. If it would be more natural in your language, you could reverse the order of these phrases, since the second phrase gives the reason for the result that the first phrase describes. Alternate translation: [The sweet wine has been cut off from your mouth, so wail upon it, all of the drinkers of wine]
1:5	q7n2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	נִכְרַ֖ת מִ⁠פִּי⁠כֶֽם	1	This is an expression that means that something is no longer available. Your language may have a comparable expression that you could use in your translation. Alternate translation: [it is no longer available for you to drink]
1:5	v7w2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	מִ⁠פִּי⁠כֶֽם	1	Since Joel is referring to a group of people, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **mouth**. Alternate translation: [from your mouths]
1:5	w4x8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	נִכְרַ֖ת מִ⁠פִּי⁠כֶֽם	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [the locusts have cut it off from your mouth]
1:6	j003		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-words-phrases	כִּֽי	1	Joel is using the word **For** to introduce the reason for what he described in the previous verse. Alternate translation: [This has happened because]
1:6	z8a3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	גוֹי֙ עָלָ֣ה עַל־אַרְצִ֔⁠י	1	See the discussion in the introduction to Joel of travel descriptions marked for change in elevation. Alternate translation: [a nation has come against my land]
1:6	j002		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	גוֹי֙	1	Joel is speaking as if this locust swarm were literally a **nation**, meaning, in this context, an “army.” If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [a great swarm of locusts]
1:6	u3v7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אַרְצִ֔⁠י	1	Since Joel and the people he is addressing live in the same land, it may be more natural in your language to say “our” instead of **my**. Alternate translation: [our land]
1:6	j7k9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	וְ⁠אֵ֣ין מִסְפָּ֑ר	1	Joel is making an overstatement for emphasis. If it would be clearer in your language, you could express the emphasis in a different way. Alternate translation: [and in huge numbers]
1:6	e5f8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	שִׁנָּי⁠ו֙ שִׁנֵּ֣י אַרְיֵ֔ה וּֽ⁠מְתַלְּע֥וֹת לָבִ֖יא לֽ⁠וֹ	1	Joel is describing the locusts as if they literally had the teeth of lions and lionesses. He means that they have strong teeth that can chew even the toughest of plants. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [Like a lion or lioness, these locusts have strong teeth that powerfully grind and chew]
1:6	r35y		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	שִׁנָּי⁠ו֙ שִׁנֵּ֣י אַרְיֵ֔ה וּֽ⁠מְתַלְּע֥וֹת לָבִ֖יא לֽ⁠וֹ	1	These two phrases, **Its teeth {are} the teeth of a lion, and the fangs of a lioness {are} to it**, mean similar things. Joel is using repetition to emphasize the idea that the phrases express. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could combine the phrases and express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: [Its teeth are as strong and sharp as the teeth of a lion] or [Its teeth, like the teeth of a lion, can tear through anything]
1:6	q8r9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-possession	וּֽ⁠מְתַלְּע֥וֹת לָבִ֖יא לֽ⁠וֹ	1	Joel is using a particular possessive form here. A different kind of possessive form may be more natural in your language. Alternate translation: [and it has the fangs of a lioness]
1:7	w9x2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	שָׂ֤ם גַּפְנִ⁠י֙ לְ⁠שַׁמָּ֔ה וּ⁠תְאֵנָתִ֖⁠י לִ⁠קְצָפָ֑ה	1	Since Joel and the people whom he is addressing eat the same crops, it may be more natural in your language to say “our” instead of **my**. Alternate translation: [It has made our vines into a waste and our fig trees into splinters]
1:7	g4h8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	שָׂ֤ם גַּפְנִ⁠י֙ לְ⁠שַׁמָּ֔ה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **waste**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [It has wasted my vine] or [It has ruined my vine]
1:7	b5c9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-reduplication	חָשֹׂ֤ף חֲשָׂפָ⁠הּ֙	1	Joel is repeating the verb “strip” in order to intensify the idea that it expresses. If your language can repeat words for intensification, it would be appropriate to do that here in your translation. If not, your language may have another way of expressing the emphasis. Alternate translation: [It has stripped it completely]
1:7	g1h4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠הִשְׁלִ֔יךְ	1	Joel is speaking as if the locusts had literally **thrown … away** the vegetation they had finished eating. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [spit it out]
1:7	j004		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	הִלְבִּ֖ינוּ שָׂרִיגֶֽי⁠הָ	1	Joel is using the term **have become white** to mean that the branches have been stripped of their bark, by association with the way the wood underneath the bark is white in color. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [its branches have been stripped of their bark]
1:8	q5r7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אֱלִ֕י	1	The imperative **Mourn** is feminine singular because Joel is telling the community to mourn as it would as if it were a young woman whose fiancé had died. It may be more natural in your language to use a plural imperative.
1:8	h7j2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	כִּ⁠בְתוּלָ֥ה חֲגֻֽרַת־שַׂ֖ק עַל־בַּ֥עַל נְעוּרֶֽי⁠הָ	1	The point of this comparison is that just as a virgin dresses in sackcloth to express her grief, so the Israelites should mourn to express their grief. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: [like a virgin dressed in sackcloth to express her grief for the husband of her youth]
1:8	g7h3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-symaction	כִּ⁠בְתוּלָ֥ה חֲגֻֽרַת־שַׂ֖ק	1	To wear **sackcloth**, which is clothing made of rough, uncomfortable fabric, is a symbolic action that expresses grief. If it would be helpful to your readers, you could explain the significance of this action. Alternate translation: [like a virgin dressed in sackcloth to express her grief]
1:8	y6z1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	כִּ⁠בְתוּלָ֥ה חֲגֻֽרַת־שַׂ֖ק	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [like a virgin who has dressed herself in sackcloth]
1:8	j005		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בַּ֥עַל נְעוּרֶֽי⁠הָ	1	Joel assumes that his listeners will know that by **the husband of her youth**, he means the fiancé to whom a young woman was betrothed. The word **virgin** indicates that this woman was not yet married, but in this culture, engagement was tanatmount to marriage and a fiancé was considered a **husband**. You could express this relationship with your own culture’s characteristic terms if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [the fiancé of her youth]
1:8	j2k6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	בַּ֥עַל נְעוּרֶֽי⁠הָ	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **youth**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [the man she became engaged to while she was young]

Alternate translation: [The locusts have cut off the grain offering and the drink offering]
1:9	m5db		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	הָכְרַ֥ת & מִ⁠בֵּ֣ית	1	The phrase **have been cut off** is an expression that means that something is no longer available. Your language may have a comparable expression that you could use in your translation. Alternate translation: [are no longer available for the house]
1:9	t9u2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	מִ⁠בֵּ֣ית יְהוָ֑ה	1	As the introduction to this chapter discusses, here and often in this chapter, Joel is using the word **house** to mean “temple.” Alternate translation: [from the temple of Yahweh]

Alternate translation: [The locusts have destroyed the field, the ground mourns, for the locusts have destroyed the grain]
1:10	k6l2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	שֻׁדַּ֣ד שָׂדֶ֔ה & שֻׁדַּ֣ד	1	Joel is not referring to a specific **field**. He means fields in general.

If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [the ground is bare]
1:10	j7k2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	הוֹבִ֥ישׁ תִּיר֖וֹשׁ	1	Joel is speaking as if the **new wine** the Israelites would have gotten from this harvest had literally dried up. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [the new wine disappears as if it had evaporated] or [the new wine runs out]
1:10	j008		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive	אֻמְלַ֥ל יִצְהָֽר	1	If your language does not use this passive form, you could express the idea in active form or in another way that is natural in your language. Alternate translation: [the oil has become weak]
1:10	a6rw		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	אֻמְלַ֥ל יִצְהָֽר	1	Here Joel is speaking of the supply of **oil** as if it had been strong and now was **weak**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [the supply of oil is low] or [the oil runs out]
1:11	m8n5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	שָׂדֶֽה	1	Joel is not referring to a specific **field**. He means fields in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: [the fields]

2:intro	j2gp				0	# Joel 2 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\n2:1–11 Joel depicts the locust swarm as an army and the attack as the “day of Yahweh”\n2:12–17 Joel and Yahweh call the people of Judah to repentance\n2:18–27 Yahweh promises to have mercy on his people and restore them\n2:28–32 Yahweh says that in the future he will pour out his Spirit\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than its usual text because it is poetry.\n\n## Translation Issues in This Chapter\n\n### “Face” meaning “in front of”\n\nSeveral times in this chapter ([2:3](../02/03.md), [2:6](../02/06.md), [2:10](../02/10.md), [2:11](../02/11.md), [2:31](../02/31.md)), phrases with the word **face** mean “in front of” or “before,” by association with the way people can see what is in front of or before their faces. (See: [[rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]])\n\n## Textual Issues in This Chapter\n\nIn [2:7](../02/07.md), the traditional Hebrew text reads “they do not pledge their paths.” The ULT follows that reading. Some ancient versions suggest that the original reading may have been “they do not turn from their paths.” If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.\n\nIn [2:17](../02/17.md), the traditional Hebrew text reads “for the nations to rule over them.” The ULT follows that reading. The consonantal text also permits the reading “for them to become a byword to the nations.” Several modern versions of the Bible follow that reading. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.

2:8	j031		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	וּ⁠בְעַ֥ד הַ⁠שֶּׁ֛לַח יִפֹּ֖לוּ לֹ֥א יִבְצָֽעוּ	1	This could mean: (1) Alternate translation: [They jump in among the weapons without breaking ranks] or (2) Alternate translation: [Even though weapons may kill some of them, the swarm keeps coming]
2:9	s5t1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-litany	בָּ⁠עִ֣יר יָשֹׁ֗קּוּ בַּֽ⁠חוֹמָה֙ יְרֻצ֔וּ⁠ן בַּ⁠בָּתִּ֖ים יַעֲל֑וּ בְּעַ֧ד הַ⁠חַלּוֹנִ֛ים יָבֹ֖אוּ כַּ⁠גַּנָּֽב	1	See the discussion in the introduction to Joel of the litany form and how you might format this verse in your translation to show that Joel is using litany.
2:9	f3g5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-simile	בְּעַ֧ד הַ⁠חַלּוֹנִ֛ים יָבֹ֖אוּ כַּ⁠גַּנָּֽב	1	The point of this comparison is that just as thieves enter unexpectedly and undetected through windows, so the locusts get into homes in ways that people do not anticipate and so, cannot prevent. If it would be helpful in your language, you could make this point explicitly. Alternate translation: [they get into homes in unexpected ways, just as thieves sneak in through windows]
2:10	l5m7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	לְ⁠פָנָי⁠ו֙ רָ֣גְזָה אֶ֔רֶץ רָעֲשׁ֖וּ שָׁמָ֑יִם	1	Joel is speaking as if the locust swarm were so powerful that it was causing the **earth** to shake and the **heavens** to **tremble**. He means that the locusts make such a loud sound and cause such vibration that it seems like this is happening. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [They make such a loud sound and cause such vibration that it is as if the earth is shaking and the heavens are trembling]
2:10	c5d9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole	שֶׁ֤מֶשׁ וְ⁠יָרֵ֨חַ֙ קָדָ֔רוּ	1	Joel is speaking as if **the sun and the moon** had literally become **dark**. He means that the locust swarm is blocking their light. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [the locust swarm blocks the light of the sun and moon]
2:10	e3f5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	וְ⁠כוֹכָבִ֖ים אָסְפ֥וּ נָגְהָֽ⁠ם	1	Joel is speaking of **the stars** as if they were living things that could **withdraw their brightness**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [the light of the stars is no longer visible]
2:11	j034		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	קוֹל⁠וֹ֙	1	Joel is using the term **voice** to mean Yahweh’s commands, by association with the way authorities use their voices to give commands. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [his commands]
2:11	j035		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	מַחֲנֵ֔⁠הוּ	1	Joel is using the term **camp** to mean Yahweh’s army, by association with the way armies stay in camps. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [is his army]
2:11	j032		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	דְבָר֑⁠וֹ	1	Joel is using the term **word** to mean Yahweh’s orders, by association with the way people use words to give orders or instructions. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [his commands]
2:11	u9v4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	כִּֽי־גָד֧וֹל יוֹם־יְהוָ֛ה וְ⁠נוֹרָ֥א מְאֹ֖ד וּ⁠מִ֥י יְכִילֶֽ⁠נּוּ	1	Joel is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [For the day of Yahweh is great and very fearful, and very few will endure it!]
2:11	j033		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	יוֹם־יְהוָ֛ה	1	See how you translated the same expression in [1:15](../01/15.md).
2:12	p9q3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	וְ⁠גַם־עַתָּה֙ נְאֻם־יְהוָ֔ה שֻׁ֥בוּ עָדַ֖⁠י	1	The phrase **the declaration of Yahweh** indicates that this is a direct quotation from Yahweh. You may wish to indicate that in your translation using a natural way of introducing direct quotations in your language. Alternate translation: [Yahweh declares, “Yet even now, return to me]
2:12	u3v8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-yousingular	שֻׁ֥בוּ	1	The imperative **return** is plural here because Yahweh is addressing the people of Judah. For the same reason, the imperatives and the word “your” are plural in [verses 13–16](../02/13.md), in which Joel is speaking. So use plural forms in your translation if your language marks that distinction.
2:12	c0yn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	שֻׁ֥בוּ עָדַ֖⁠י בְּ⁠כָל־לְבַבְ⁠כֶ֑ם	1	Here, Yahweh is speaking of people repenting of their sin as a **return** to him, and he is speaking of their **heart** to represent their thoughts and motives. You may have a similar way to talk about these things, or you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [sincerely repent of disobeying me in your thoughts and motives] or [come back to me in genuine and complete repentance]
2:12	x9y4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/grammar-collectivenouns	לְבַבְ⁠כֶ֑ם	1	Since Yahweh is referring to a group of people, it might be more natural in your language to use the plural form of **heart**. Alternate translation: [your hearts]
2:13	e7f2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וְ⁠קִרְע֤וּ לְבַבְ⁠כֶם֙ וְ⁠אַל־בִּגְדֵי⁠כֶ֔ם	1	Joel is speaking as if people could literally tear their hearts. He is using the contrast with tearing garments, which was a literal sign of mourning, to emphasize internal repentance. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [And do not only tear your garments; repent in your hearts]
2:13	j036		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	וְ⁠קִרְע֤וּ לְבַבְ⁠כֶם֙ וְ⁠אַל־בִּגְדֵי⁠כֶ֔ם וְ⁠שׁ֖וּבוּ אֶל־יְהוָ֣ה אֱלֹֽהֵי⁠כֶ֑ם	1	Some versions end the quotation that begins in [verse 12](../02/12.md) after this sentence instead of at the end of [verse 12](../02/12.md). If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to follow the quotation boundaries that it has. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the same boundaries as the ULT.
2:13	rvjd		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	אֶ֤רֶךְ אַפַּ֨יִם֙	1	Here, **long of nostrils** is an idiom meaning that the person is slow to get angry. If this phrase does not have that meaning in your language, use an idiom from your language that does have that meaning or state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [long-tempered] or [slow to become angry]
2:13	u6v9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וְ⁠רַב־חֶ֔סֶד	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **kindness**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [and very kind]
2:14	w1x6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	מִ֥י יוֹדֵ֖עַ יָשׁ֣וּב וְ⁠נִחָ֑ם וְ⁠הִשְׁאִ֤יר אַֽחֲרָי⁠ו֙ בְּרָכָ֔ה	1	Joel is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [For all anyone knows, he may turn and relent and leave a blessing after him]
2:14	j037		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	יָשׁ֣וּב וְ⁠נִחָ֑ם	1	The terms **turn** and **relent** mean similar things. Joel is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: [He may indeed change his mind]
2:14	w3x7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וְ⁠הִשְׁאִ֤יר & בְּרָכָ֔ה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **blessing**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [and leave something to bless you]
2:14	j9k6		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אֱלֹהֵי⁠כֶֽם	1	Since Joel and the people he is addressing worship the same God, it may be more natural in your language to say “our” instead of **your**. Languages that mark the distinction should use the inclusive form of “our.” Alternate translation: [our God]
2:15	zn50		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	צ֖וֹם	1	Joel assumes that his readers will understand that the purpose of **a fast** was to show repentance for sin. You could include this information if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [a fast to show your repentance]
2:15	hrux		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-infostructure	קַדְּשׁוּ־צ֖וֹם קִרְא֥וּ עֲצָרָֽה	1	If it would be more natural in your language, you could mention calling the assembly and then telling the people to fast. Alternate translation: [call an assembly, consecrate a fast]
2:16	g7h8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	קִבְצ֣וּ זְקֵנִ֔ים אִסְפוּ֙ עֽוֹלָלִ֔ים וְ⁠יֹנְקֵ֖י שָׁדָ֑יִם	1	Joel is speaking of two things in order to mean those two extremes and everything in between. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [assemble people of all ages]
2:16	j038		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	יֵצֵ֤א חָתָן֙ מֵֽ⁠חֶדְר֔⁠וֹ וְ⁠כַלָּ֖ה מֵ⁠חֻפָּתָֽ⁠הּ	1	Joel means implicitly that while newlyweds are ordinarily excused from public duties, this is an exceptional circumstance that calls for even their attendance. Alternate translation: [Even newly married men and women should come to the assembly under these exceptional circumstances]
2:17	i9j1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-merism	בֵּ֤ין הָ⁠אוּלָם֙ וְ⁠לַ⁠מִּזְבֵּ֔חַ	1	Joel is speaking of these two things that are at the far extremes of the courtyard of the temple in order to refer to them and to everything in between them. If it would be helpful in your language, you could use an equivalent expression or plain language. Alternate translation: [throughout the entire court of the priests]
2:17	y9z4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וְ⁠אַל־תִּתֵּ֨ן נַחֲלָתְ⁠ךָ֤ לְ⁠חֶרְפָּה֙	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **reproach**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [and do not let other nations reproach your inheritance]
2:17	g1h8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	נַחֲלָתְ⁠ךָ֤	1	Joel is speaking of the Israelites as if they were literally something that Yahweh had inherited. Joel means that the Israelites are the people whom Yahweh has chosen. If it would be clearer in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [the people whom you have chosen]
2:17	k5m1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants	לִ⁠מְשָׁל־בָּ֣⁠ם גּוֹיִ֔ם	1	See the discussion in the introduction to this chapter of an alternate reading for this phrase. Alternate translation: [for the nations to use a proverb against them] or [for them to become a byword to the nations]
2:17	t3u7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotesinquotes	לָ֚⁠מָּה יֹאמְר֣וּ בָֽ⁠עַמִּ֔ים אַיֵּ֖ה אֱלֹהֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	If it would be clearer in your language, you could translate this so that there is not a quotation within a quotation. Alternate translation: [Why should the peoples ask where our God is?]
2:17	s4t9		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	לָ֚⁠מָּה יֹאמְר֣וּ	1	Here, **they** is an indefinite pronoun that refers to people in general. If it would be helpful in your language, you could translate this with a different expression that does not use an indefinite pronoun. Alternate translation: [Why should it be said]
2:17	j039		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	לָ֚⁠מָּה יֹאמְר֣וּ בָֽ⁠עַמִּ֔ים	1	Joel is using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [Do not allow the peoples to say]
2:17	d3nn		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion	אַיֵּ֖ה אֱלֹהֵי⁠הֶֽם	1	This example of mockery is also using the question form for emphasis. If a speaker of your language would not use the question form for that purpose, you could translate this as a statement or as an exclamation. Alternate translation: [Their God does not care about them] or [Their God must be far away!]
2:18	g26p		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	וַ⁠יְקַנֵּ֥א יְהוָ֖ה לְ⁠אַרְצ֑⁠וֹ וַ⁠יַּחְמֹ֖ל עַל־עַמּֽ⁠וֹ	1	Joel is using the past tense to describe something that is going to happen in the future, after the people repent. He may be doing this to show that the event will certainly happen. Alternatively, there may have been a gap of time between the writing of [verse 17](../02/17.md) and [verse 18](../02/18.md), and in that time, the people repented. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use the future tense in your translation of these two verses and express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: [Then Yahweh will be jealous for his land, and he will have pity on his people]
2:18	g5h7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	לְ⁠אַרְצ֑⁠וֹ	1	Joel is using the term **land** by association to mean the people living on the land. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [for his people]
2:19	nu7z		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	וַ⁠יַּ֨עַן יְהוָ֜ה וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר	1	Joel continues using the past tense here to describe something that is going to happen in the future, after the people repent. Alternatively, the people already repented and so Joel tells Yahweh’s response here. If you chose to use the future tense in [verse 18](../02/18.md), then you should also do so here. Alternate translation: [Then Yahweh will answer and say]
2:19	a1b2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-hendiadys	וַ⁠יַּ֨עַן יְהוָ֜ה וַ⁠יֹּ֣אמֶר	1	This phrase expresses a single idea by using two words connected with **and**. The word **answered** tells for what purpose Yahweh **said** this. Alternate translation: [And Yahweh replied]
2:19	g6h2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-quotations	הִנְ⁠נִ֨י שֹׁלֵ֤חַ לָ⁠כֶם֙ אֶת־הַ⁠דָּגָן֙ וְ⁠הַ⁠תִּיר֣וֹשׁ וְ⁠הַ⁠יִּצְהָ֔ר	1	This verse begins a direct quotation from Yahweh. You may wish to indicate that in your translation, using a natural way of introducing direct quotations in your language. Alternate translation: [saying, “Behold me, sending to you grain and new wine and oil]
2:19	j6r3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	הִנְ⁠נִ֨י שֹׁלֵ֤חַ	1	The expression **Behold me** doing something means “I am going to do” what is described. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: [I am going to send]
2:19	l3m8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אֹת֑⁠וֹ	1	Yahweh is using the pronoun **it** to refer to what he will send to the Israelites. But since he lists **grain**, **wine**, and **oil**, it may be more natural in your language to use a plural pronoun. Alternate translation: [of them]
2:19	b5c1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	וְ⁠לֹא־אֶתֵּ֨ן אֶתְ⁠כֶ֥ם ע֛וֹד חֶרְפָּ֖ה בַּ⁠גּוֹיִֽם	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **reproach**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [and I will no longer make the nations reproach you]
2:20	j1k3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	וְֽ⁠אֶת־הַ⁠צְּפוֹנִ֞י	1	Yahweh is using the term **northerner** to refer to an invading army of some kind, by association with the direction from which invasions often came. It seems that this term is purposely vague so that it can refer to the current locust invasion as well as to a future military invasion on “the day of Yahweh” ([verse 11](../02/11.md)). If possible, use a term that could refer to both. Alternate translation: [the invaders]
2:20	d7e3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	אֶ֣רֶץ צִיָּ֣ה וּ⁠שְׁמָמָה֒	1	If your language does not use abstract nouns for the ideas of **dryness** and **desolation**, you could express the same ideas in another way. Alternate translation: [a dry and desolate land]
2:20	w1x5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	אֶ֣רֶץ צִיָּ֣ה וּ⁠שְׁמָמָה֒	1	The terms **dryness** and **desolation** mean similar things. Yahweh is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: [a completely barren land]
2:20	j040		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-personification	אֶל & אֶת־פָּנָ֗י⁠ו אֶל־הַ⁠יָּם֙ הַ⁠קַּדְמֹנִ֔י וְ⁠סֹפ֖⁠וֹ אֶל־הַ⁠יָּ֣ם הָ⁠אַֽחֲר֑וֹן	1	Yahweh is speaking of the invading army or locust swarm as if it were a living thing that had a **face** and a **back**. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [the invaders at the front of the group will fall into the eastern sea and die, and the invaders at the back of the group will fall into the western sea and die]
2:20	j041		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	אֶל & אֶת־פָּנָ֗י⁠ו אֶל־הַ⁠יָּם֙ הַ⁠קַּדְמֹנִ֔י וְ⁠סֹפ֖⁠וֹ אֶל־הַ⁠יָּ֣ם הָ⁠אַֽחֲר֑וֹן	1	Yahweh is speaking to the Judeans from the perspective of their own culture and location. By **eastern sea**, he means the Dead Sea, and by **western sea**, he means the Mediterranean Sea. You could say that explicitly if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [his face into the Dead Sea and his back into the Mediterranean Sea]
2:20	rl56		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-parallelism	וְ⁠עָלָ֣ה בָאְשׁ֗⁠וֹ וְ⁠תַ֨עַל֙ צַחֲנָת֔⁠וֹ	1	These two phrases mean the same thing. The second emphasizes the meaning of the first by repeating the same idea with different words. Hebrew poetry was based on this kind of repetition, and it would be good to show this to your readers by including both phrases in your translation rather than combining them. However, if this might be unclear in your language, you could connect the phrases with a word other than **and** in order to show that the second phrase is repeating the first one, not saying something additional. Alternatively, you could combine the phrases and express the emphasis in another way. Alternate translation: [And his stench will rise, yes, his odor will rise]
2:20	h9n5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	הִגְדִּ֖יל לַ⁠עֲשֽׂוֹת	1	This expression means “he has in some way done more than would be expected.” The implication is that the locust swarm has perhaps destroyed more crops than it ordinarily would, or that the army that will invade will be more destructive than usual. Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: [he has caused excessive destruction]
2:20	y5z1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations	כִּ֥י הִגְדִּ֖יל לַ⁠עֲשֽׂוֹת	1	Some versions end the quotation that begins in [verse 19](../02/19.md) before this clause. Other versions end that quotation after this clause. Some other versions do not end that quotation in this verse, so that it continues through [3:8](../03/08.md). If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to follow the quotation boundaries that it has. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the same boundaries as the ULT.
2:21	q7r3		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe	אַל־תִּֽירְאִ֖י אֲדָמָ֑ה גִּ֣ילִי וּ⁠שְׂמָ֔חִי	1	Joel is speaking to the **land** as if it were a person who could hear him. He is doing this to show in a strong way how he feels about what Yahweh will do for the land. Joel is actually speaking to the people who can hear him. If your readers might not understand this kind of figurative speech, you could translate what Joel is saying as if he were speaking directly to the Judeans. Alternate translation: [You Judeans should not be afraid because of what has happened to the land. Be glad and rejoice]
2:21	j042		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-doublet	גִּ֣ילִי וּ⁠שְׂמָ֔חִי	1	The terms **glad** and **rejoice** mean similar things. Joel is using the two terms together for emphasis. If it would be clearer for your readers, you could express the emphasis with a single phrase. Alternate translation: [Celebrate with great joy]
2:21	a9b2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	הִגְדִּ֥יל יְהוָ֖ה לַ⁠עֲשֽׂוֹת	1	Joel is using the past tense to describe something that is going to happen in the future in order to show that the event will certainly happen. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use the future tense. Alternate translation: [Yahweh will be great in doing]
2:21	z4m1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom	הִגְדִּ֥יל יְהוָ֖ה לַ⁠עֲשֽׂוֹת	1	Unlike the use in the previous verse, here this expression means “he has done more good things for us than we would have imagined.” Your language may have a comparable expression that you can use in your translation. Alternate translation: [Yahweh has done wonderful things]
2:22	s9t5		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-apostrophe	אַל־תִּֽירְאוּ֙ בַּהֲמ֣וֹת שָׂדַ֔י	1	Joel is once again speaking to the **beasts of the field** as if they were people who could hear him. He is doing this to show his Judean listeners in a strong way how he feels about what Yahweh will do for them by restoring the pastures and the trees. If your readers might not understand this kind of figurative speech, you could translate what Joel is saying as if he were speaking directly to the Judeans. Alternate translation: [You Judeans should also not be afraid of what will happen to the beasts of the field]
2:22	c3d7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	דָשְׁא֖וּ נְא֣וֹת מִדְבָּ֑ר כִּֽי־עֵץ֙ נָשָׂ֣א פִרְי֔⁠וֹ תְּאֵנָ֥ה וָ⁠גֶ֖פֶן נָתְנ֥וּ חֵילָֽ⁠ם	1	Joel is using the past tense to describe something that is going to happen in the future in order to show that the event will certainly happen. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use the future tense. Alternate translation: [the pastures of the wilderness will sprout, for the tree will bear its fruit, the fig tree and the vine will yield their strength]
2:22	x3y7		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	עֵץ֙ נָשָׂ֣א פִרְי֔⁠וֹ תְּאֵנָ֥ה וָ⁠גֶ֖פֶן נָתְנ֥וּ חֵילָֽ⁠ם	1	Joel is not referring to a specific **tree**, **fig tree**, or **vine**. He is referring to these plants in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using plural forms. Alternate translation: [the trees have borne their fruit, the fig trees and the vines have yielded their strength]
2:22	l9m2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy	חֵילָֽ⁠ם	1	Joel is using the term **strength** to mean the harvest, by association with the way the land has the capacity to produce crops. If it would be helpful in your language, you could state the meaning plainly. Alternate translation: [their harvest]
2:23	n5p2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor	וּ⁠בְנֵ֣י צִיּ֗וֹן	1	Joel is speaking as if **Zion**, meaning Jerusalem, were literally the mother of the people who lived in that city. Alternate translation: [residents of Zion] or [citizens of Jerusalem]
2:23	n7p2		rc://*/ta/man/translate/writing-pronouns	אֱלֹֽהֵי⁠כֶ֔ם	1	Since Joel and the people whom he is addressing worship the same God, it may be more natural in your language to say “our” instead of **your**. Languages that mark the distinction should use the inclusive form of “our.” Alternate translation: [our God]
2:23	e5f1		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-pastforfuture	נָתַ֥ן לָ⁠כֶ֛ם אֶת־הַ⁠מּוֹרֶ֖ה לִ⁠צְדָקָ֑ה וַ⁠יּ֣וֹרֶד לָ⁠כֶ֗ם גֶּ֛שֶׁם	1	Joel is using the past tense to describe something that is going to happen in the future in order to show that the event will certainly happen. If it would be clearer in your language, you could use the future tense. Alternate translation: [he will give to you the early rain for vindication and will bring down the shower to you]
2:23	f2g8		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-abstractnouns	לִ⁠צְדָקָ֑ה	1	If your language does not use an abstract noun for the idea of **vindication**, you could express the same idea in another way. Alternate translation: [to vindicate you]
2:23	z9a4		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-genericnoun	גֶּ֛שֶׁם	1	Joel is not referring to a specific **shower**. He means showers in general. It may be more natural in your language to express this meaning by using a plural form. Alternate translation: [showers]
2:23	j043		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	מוֹרֶ֥ה וּ⁠מַלְק֖וֹשׁ	1	Joel is speaking from the perspective of his own culture and location. By **early rain** he means the fall rains, and by **late rain** he means the spring rains. You could say that explicitly if that would be helpful to your readers. Alternate translation: [the fall rains and the spring rains]
2:23	j044		rc://*/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit	בָּ⁠רִאשֽׁוֹן	1	Joel is speaking from the perspective of his own culture. By **in the first**, he could mean either (1) Alternate translation: [as at first] or [as before] or (2) Alternate translation: [in the first month of the year]

3:intro	jcn7				0	# Joel 3 Chapter Introduction\n\n## Structure and Formatting\n\nIn this chapter, Yahweh declares that he will judge the nations\n\nThe ULT sets the lines of this chapter farther to the right on the page than its usual text because it is poetry.\n\n## Textual Issues in This Chapter\n\nIn [3:1](../03/01.md), Jewish scribes instructed synagogue readers to say “restore the fortunes” when they got to the phrase in this verse that the ULT translates as “return the captivity.” That suggests that the original reading may have been “restore the fortunes.” Some modern versions follow that reading. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.\n\nIn [3:21](../03/21.md), the traditional Hebrew text reads “I will acquit their blood … I have not acquitted.” The ULT follows that reading. Some ancient versions suggest that the original reading may have been “I will avenge their blood … I have not avenged.” Some modern versions follow that reading. If a translation of the Bible exists in your region, you may wish to use the reading that it uses. If a translation of the Bible does not exist in your region, you may wish to use the reading of the ULT.
